S'I adore this Bride s approach to planning - she said,  I simply chose elements we liked, and it seemed to work.  And boy did it all work. With the help of Parsonage Events, all of the pretty little pieces fell perfectly into place, so when Lux Light Photography stepped behind the camera to capture it all, magic happened. It leaves us with a gallery too fabulous to miss, and you can see it all here.'

aS'From The Bride For Dane and I, the great thing about dating for 13 years before getting married is that we had subconsciously already started thinking alike and had merged our two styles. You know, that thing that thing that usually happens after you ve been married awhile This, along with my event planning background, gave way to swift and painless decision making.'
p48
aS'Our fabulous florist and design consultant, Parsonage Events, coined our wedding style as  Rustic Elegance . Conscious that sometimes following a theme can come off a little too contrived, I simply chose elements that we liked, and it seemed to work. For example, Dane is an avid deer hunter, along with a number of guests at our wedding. Being that our wedding date was during MI bow season, and that the Forest Dunes logo included a deer with antlers, I chose an antler motif for the letterpress invites, by Something Fabulous, and engraved pint glasses (favors). We also chose venison as an appetizer and walleye as one of the dinner options, both indigenous to Northern MI. Inspiration for the ceremony came from our shared love of fishing, kayaking and camping on the Ausable River, as well as an image of the large cross I found on SMP. My design obsession of combining different materials was evident throughout our reception. To maximize space and for cost efficiency, we used both existing wooden tables and rented rounds. A combination of tablecloths, runners and place mats gave the room depth, and all linens were sewn by my mom, as a true labor of love! Soft feminine floral was housed in a mix of clear and colored vintage glass and pewter pedestal bowls; and they were balanced by the dark wood and masculinity of the room. Each setting included a vintage metal napkin ring, which I collected for months before the big day. Because we love a good bonfire, and Forest Dunes has a great bonfire pit on their back patio, we had to include smores. True to our childhood, the sticks had to be found in the woods and whittled down (thanks to my brother, Luke)! Inspiration for the traditional cake from Bella e Dolce, came from the lace detail of my dress. Proud and excited by our new monogram, seen on the cake, I painted the large wooden letters that hung from the loft and my mom surprised us by having it embroidered on the head table runner, which we now use in our home. Afterwards, many of our guests commented that they could really  see Dane and Emily  in each of the special touches of that day. To us, this meant success!'
p49
aS'For love of early to mid 20th century fashion, I was drawn to the Ivy and Aster Collette gown, and the Elizabeth pumps by Emmy Shoes. A pearl necklace and bracelet were passed down to me by great grandmothers on both my mom and dad s side. The costume broach seen on my bouquet was once Dane s great aunt s, accompanied by a hankie that was tatted by yet another of my great grandmothers. The satin clutch I used was made by my mom, using fabric from my grandmother s wedding dress. Bridesmaids chose their own dress and color, which happened to be from both JCrew and Ann Taylor, necklaces by JCrew and Bagley Mischka pumps. Guys suits were custom Joseph Abboud from Nordstrom and sage trout ties from Buffalo Jackson.\n'

S'This bride admits getting a November wedding in Chicago to feel  warm  is a challenge, but with the help of Clementine Custom Events, florals from Studio AG, and a significant number of candles, she most certainly pulled it off. Christy Tyler Photography did a lovely job capturing the event so if you like what you see, find the full gallery here. And don t miss the film from Xpress Video Productions at the end!'

aS'From The Bride Brian and I first met on the first day of class at Indiana University in 2005. Starting off as friends first, by spring semester we were officially dating and in May of 2012 we were engaged. I grew up in New Jersey and Brian was raised in the Chicagoland area, so Chicago has played a huge role in cultivating our relationship as Brian has strong roots and is where I would frequently visit. In the past, I had visited Chicago with my family and can remember riding the Ferris wheel and falling with the romantic setting that was Navy Pier. Frank Sinatra s My Kind Of Town came over the speaker and I can remember saying to myself,  this is the perfect place to get engaged one day.  During one summer in the beginning of our relationship, I visited Brian where we rode the Ferris wheel together and I told him this story. Brian would later admit that it was in that moment he realized this was real and if our relationship continued, is where he would propose. As fate would have it, Six years later, he got down on one knee in one of the gondolas and asked me to marry him.'
p107
aS'Wedding planning began and we both knew that we wanted the wedding day to encompass three central themes   Our love for our families, our love for the city of Chicago, and our love for each other. We both have large extended families and a unique network of friends who hail from various locations. Several family members and friends traveled from India, the Netherlands, and Japan along with other guests who arrived from Texas, Washington State, Washington D.C., and from all over the East and West Coast. The day was 18 months in the making and every moment was as we had imagined and hoped.'
p108
aS'As a young girl, my father passed away and my mom, in all of her strength, was left to care for myself and my younger sister Alana. My mom would eventually remarry and together we would create the most loving blended family but I still wanted to find a way for my dad to walk me down the aisle. Growing up, I kept a tie that reminded me of him in a box in my room after he passed away. So on our wedding day, I took that tie and wrapped it around my bouquet so that he could be with me. My mom walked me half way down the aisle where I then was joined by my step father until we met Brian at the end. All of our guests in attendance who are like family to us, understood this symbolized our path and how each person joined our lives in different stages.'
p109
aS'We wanted our guests to feel enveloped in warmth which we ll admit, is hard to do in November in Chicago. To create this feeling, we decided on d cor which consisted of warm off-white flowers, mix metal floral vessels and more candles then I think the fire code actually allowed. The ceremony musicians played renditions of Coldplay, The Beatles and Adele songs so the room felt more like a family room. All of my bridesmaids being so wonderfully unique were able to select their favorite flower, all beautiful and exceptional just like them.'
p110
aS'TheWit hotel also had the absolute perfect backdrop for a swanky cocktail hour on ROOF, which gave our mostly out of town crowd, a VIP experience and a taste of one of our favorite rooftop bars in the city. The Reception included more nod s to Chicago with each table named after some our favorite Chicago landmarks with a printed history on the back since Chicago history is one of Brian s favorite subjects.'
p111
aS'My most favorite part of the day though was after reading our vows to each other which we wrote in secret, hearing us both ending our vows with a promise to love each other  Always and forever.  Almost every love letter, card and post it note I wrote to Brian until then ended this way and perfectly encapsulates why we wanted to make this commitment to each other. If I could ask for one more thing it would be the opportunity to do it all over again in exactly the same way.\n'

S'This wedding had me at hello.  Or, if we re being technical, it had me at  a vintage, jazz filled, history-inspired, Old Chicago wedding.   Because anytime you give me a classic venue like The University Club Of Chicago mixed with beautiful vintage-inspired details and a bride and groom who are too cute for words (seriously), I am one very happy lady.  Press play to see every moment captured by Nicodem Creative.  It s amazing.'
p217
aS'From Nicodem Creative  There is a certain marriage of timeless strength and graceful beauty in the city of Chicago, IL. From the stone and steel skyscrapers that tower over Michigan Avenue to the curving lake shore dotted with bobbing sailboats, it is a city built for classic, elegant affairs. When we met with Robby and Tala a few months before the special day to discuss their hopes and dreams, that was the plan they proposed: a vintage, jazz filled, history-inspired, Old Chicago wedding. And it did not disappoint.'
p218
aS'The day began at the University Club of Chicago, a private social club that began in 1887 in the heart of the Loop, and a pillar of old city tradition. While the men donned their suits and pocket watches in the Billiards Room, complete with felted poker tables and various game birds stuffed and mounted on the walls, the bride and her bridesmaids busied themselves with their hair and makeup in the Club s chic Barber Shop. And no First Look could have been as timeless and truly classic as what immediately followed in the stately, spacious Library, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city below, shelves lined with old books, and rich leather chairs scattered before a massive stone fireplace.'
p219
aS'And that was just the beginning. From photos in front of the city s iconic  Cloud Gate  and up along the shore of Lake Michigan, to the ceremony held in historic Wrigleyville, back down to the University Club for cocktails in the Library, all culminating in a delightful dinner and dancing in the grand ballroom, it was a night of pure elegance. And no true Chicago wedding experience could end without a private rooftop kiss overlooking the city streets below, the fireworks from Navy Pier bursting in the distance at just the right time. It was a joy to take part in the celebration of Robby and Tala, and the epitome of a classic, Old Chicago wedding.'
p220
aS'From The Bride  Robby and I met at a wedding in Miami, FL. A year later, he called me out of the blue and we began getting to know each other while I was living in Detroit and he in Chicago. After nine months of long phone conversations, lengthy car rides and flights to see each other, Robby proposed on his family s farm in Western Kansas. I moved to Chicago shortly after and had eight months to plan our big day!'
p221
aS'When we decided to get married in Chicago, Robby and I were immediately drawn to the historic buildings in the city that had charm and character. Our elegant vintage theme was effortless to attain after choosing the University Club of Chicago as our venue. We have a mutual love for live jazz, old books and mid-century fashion which came together magically for our wedding day. One of my favorite moments was our private first look in the library; all the details that we had worked so hard to perfect culminated at that point and we could relax with each other and enjoy the rest of the day. The entire occasion was everything we hoped for, and we are still reminiscing about the best day of our lives!'

aS'I had my Pi Beta Phi pin attached to my flowers, to honor the sorority that brought me my lifelong sisters. All of the jewelry I wore were borrowed from important women in my life. My maternal grandmothers Bible sat on the altar with our unity candles. The crown my paternal grandmother wore on her wedding day over 55 years ago sat on the top of our delicious cake. The women in my family baked hundreds of Italian cookies to give out as favors. Tim s grandmother was a huge influence in his life, and we served oreo cookies and shots of milk on the dance floor to honor her, as this was his favorite memory of her, sitting at her kitchen table eating cookies and milk together. For new traditions, we had the artist Happy Menocal create our custom family crest, spent many (fun) nights crafting our signature cocktail, the George s Grapefruit Gimlet, and read an untraditional poem during our ceremony that is important to us.

aS'From The Bride  When Lucas and I first got engaged, we knew we didn t want a traditional church wedding and ballroom reception. My brother tipped me off to Norskedalen. His exact words:  You should check out Norskedalen! It s perfect. You ll love it!  He was right. From the moment I stepped foot onto the Norskedalen property, I knew it was where we wanted to be married.'
p343
aS'Initially, we fretted a bit over the possibility of bad weather   I even found myself researching average temperatures on September 15th, as well as how frequently it has rained on that date   but we quickly decided to trust our instincts and know that everything would be ok. As you can see from the photos, it couldn t have been a more perfect September day, with a high of 78 and not a cloud in the sky.'
p344
aS'After settling on location, the next task Lucas and I dove into was music selection. Music is very important to both of us, so we knew we wanted to put a lot of thought into our music selections. We began compiling playlists   guest shuttle, bridal party shuttle, pre-ceremony, ceremony, post-ceremony recessional, cocktail hour, dinner, dance. Every song that played throughout our wedding, with the exception of the dance, was hand picked by us. We even made sure the songs transitioned well from one to another.'
p345
aS'The drive out to Norskedalen was at least 30 minutes from town, so we arranged for coach transportation. We made a playlist for that, tailoring our music selections to the drive so that they started off with Animal Collective s  My Girls  in the city and ended with Band of Horses  I Go to the Barn Because I Like The  in the countryside. In between they heard Lucy Michelle and the Velvet Lapelles, Modest Mouse, The Kinks, The Beatles, Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes, and more. For the ceremony, we selected some of our favorite songs to play prior to the ceremony and immediately following, such as  Go Do  by Jonsi. The bridal party walked down the aisle to  Om Nashi Me  by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes, and we recessed to  Home,  also by Edward Sharpe. The most important song of all to me was my bridal procession. Before Lucas and I even got engaged, we knew that if we got married someday, I would walk down the aisle to  Saeglopur  by Sigur Ros. Sigur Ros has been my favorite band since I was 17 years old.'
p346
aS'During cocktail hour, we played some of our favorite upbeat selections, including indie artists like Beirut, Kings of Convenience, and Devendra Banhart, but we wanted an eclectic mix too, since our tastes vary, so we also included songs like  In the Summertime  by Mungo Jerry,  Dream  by the Everly Brothers, and  Mas Que Nada  by Sergio Mendes. During dinner, we decided to combine a mix of Rat Pack era lounge music with acoustic or lounge-style covers of alternative songs. For instance, Caetano Veloso s samba-inspired medley of Michael Jackson s  Billie Jean  or Regina Spektor s cover of Radiohea ds  No Surprises.  We wanted our guests to sit back and enjoy dinner and, once in a while, say to one another,  Is that a Nirvana cover? '
p347
aS'For our first dance, Lucas and I chose  Hysteric  by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. We couldn t wait to dance to that song. For the mother/son and father/daughter dance, we decided to share the dance floor to Ben E. Knight s  Stand by Me.  Lucas  mom has been his rock his whole life, and my father has supported me immensely. Those relationships are very important to us, and we are extremely close. We chose Stand By Me because we wanted our parents to know that even though we are grown up and married now, we still need them to stand by us and we will in turn stand by their side as well in love and support.'
p348
aS'For the dance, we chose a DJ over a live band and don t regret it for a minute. The dance floor was packed until the night ended! We gave the DJ a list of requests and, most importantly, a strict list of  Do Not Plays.  Perhaps I m biased, but I think Kelly Wild served up the best wedding dance playlist I ve encountered. We had so much fun!'
p349
aS'I ve talked about music a lot because it played such a vital role in our wedding day. We thought of it as our soundtrack. But that isn t all that went into our day.'
p350
aS'Design: I ve always described nature as my reset button, so we knew we wanted an outdoor wedding, and the rolling hills Norskedalen Norwegian Nature & Heritage Center was the perfect canvas. a rustic wedding but not a country wedding, so we introduced lux elements, such as chandeliers in trees. We wanted a bit of a hippie vibe but still high class, hence moss-covered tables with candelabras. We also wanted to include Lucas  love for literature, so we included vintage books in our design. Our primary colors were plum and moss green. The purple was inspired by my Grandmother, Marie Lokken. She passed away a few years ago, and purple was by far her favorite color   everything was purple for grandma   so we wanted to honor her by using a dusty plum throughout our design. Weddings by Nancy beautifully executed our vision.'
p351
aS'Rings: The ring Lucas proposed with is my Grandma Lokken s wedding ring. She was very special to me, which is why we chose to take things further and use the plum color as part of our design inspiration. Additionally, Lucas  ring is his father s wedding ring. Unfortunately Lucas lost his dad when he was a baby, so it is very special for him to be able to wear Tom s ring. We love our heirloom rings, and there s nothing else we would have wanted.'
p352
aS'Food: We worked with Traditions, a local restaurant and caterer in Onalaska, Wisconsin. They created a custom menu for our wedding and used all local and seasonal ingredients, which was very important to me and Lucas. We utilized passed hors d ouvres during cocktail hour, which was a very elegant touch.'
p353
aS'Beverages: My father loves wine. Since we used an outdoor venue, we were able to purchase all of the beer and wine and other beverages ourselves. In turn, my dad hand selected all the different wines we served, which were provided by UnWine d from Onalaska, WI. We also served New Glarus beers, our favorite Wisconsin brewery.'
p354
aS'Save the Date/Invitation/Program: I love writing, so I developed all the content for these items. Our close friend, Helena Ejica Martinez, is responsible for all of the design work, however. She is an incredibly talented artist and hand drew all of the artwork. Helena and I spent many late nights brainstorming concept and working on layout. This was a true labor of love, but I am so glad to have been a part of it. It is so fun to be able to look at our papers and remember all the precious time I spent with Helena as she created such beautiful and special pieces for us. We will cherish these papers forever.'
p355
aS'Photography/Videography: We chose to work with Austin Gros out of Nashville and Capture Studios out of Minneapolis because they truly provide beautiful lifestyle and documentary style photography and videography. So much talent and so much creativity. When we look back at our photos and videos, it s as if we re experiencing the day all over again. That is what we wanted   to be able to relive our special day.'
p356
aS'Final thoughts: So many people told us they didn t remember their own wedding day. We didn t want that to be true of our experience, so we really took the time to enjoy and appreciate every moment of our day. We can look back and say that we had as much fun at our own wedding as we have at other people s weddings   which is a big deal! That is the advice I will give every bride-to-be just enjoy it. It goes by so fast, so give yourself permission to take everything in. This is your day, and no one expects you to do anything but enjoy yourself. Talk to who you want to talk to, take time to walk around and look at all of your flowers and the design work, sit down and eat your meal, drink your champagne, eat your cake, and dance until you fall down (which I did). The day is too special to spend time worrying.\n'

S'Before we even get into how gorgeous this Rockford Art Museum is, can we please just take a moment to swoon over this Bride s gorgeous BHLDN gown? I am in love. It s the perfect gown for this seriously stylish affair. With its understated yet elegant vibe all captured beautifully by Ryan Timm Photography, it goes without saying this entire wedding is just beyond. See it all here.'
p398
aS'The first thing Ryan and I both knew we wanted for our ceremony was an intimate outdoor location with our closest family and friends. We both love nature and enjoy the serenity it gives. After we found the ceremony and reception locations we began to plan all of the other details.\n The dress was the next step, and once I found it I suddenly had a very clear vision of what I wished the day to look like. A day that relayed simple elegance filled with blush pink bows, lace, gold details and beautiful summer hydrangeas. This mantra of  simple elegance  quickly became the theme of our wedding.'
p399
aS'Once we had the date and attire, we were flying into high gear finding the perfect arrangement of flatware, linens and flowers. We had such a wonderful time creating a vision together and making it all come to life. I still cannot believe that we were able to have a wedding that relayed so much of our creativity and personality. It was quite a special day for me, I found my best friend and partner whom I can finally call my husband and that was the most beautiful part of the day.\n'

Photographed in equally good taste by JED Photography, scroll through for a peak into this classy ceremony. For more images head on over to the gallery.'
p431
aS'From Estera Events Matt and Michelle have been together since they met in college at Purdue. When deciding where to host their wedding that included many out of town guests, Matt and Michelle picked The Palmer House for it s rich history and Chicago feel   not to mention Michelle s love for black and gold. Her style is sophisticated and chic, but the two of them are some of the most down to earth people we ve ever had the pleasure of working with. This is the first wedding we ve done in a long time where the bride and groom waited to see each other until their ceremony, so there was such an excitement and added rush to the ceremony knowing Matt and Michelle were going to be seeing each other for the first time. Their emotions were real and everyone in the church could feel it. The entire day was filled with emotion and Jessica from JED Photography captured that in the best way. After the romantic ceremony at Notre Dame de Chicago, guests were welcomed to the Palmer House for cocktails in the mezzanine looking over the hotel. Dinner was served in the historic Empire Room followed by dancing late into the night. In keeping with the Chicago theme, late night hotdogs were served no ketchup, of course. Congratulations again, Matt & Michelle, we wish you the absolute best and thank you, again, for letting us be part of your wedding day!   Bianca, Estera Events'
p432
aS'From JED Photography  Michelle and Matt have the type of relationship that makes you smile inside because they share the love they have together with all of those around them, a contagious and timeless connection. I am completely inspired by Michelle and Matt as a couple and the style of their wedding day was such a reflection of who they are. In the year of talking with Michelle about her wedding, I heard her sharing pieces of her vision along the way but when it came down to the day of I saw this labor of love come to fruition. Every detail from the dress, Matts sock-less feet to Michelle s beautiful shoes,the ring her father gifted her the morning of the wedding and the veil she borrowed from her matron of honor reflected Michelle + Matt, one of the most caring and enjoyable couples I know.

A joyful shade of yellow and some DIY touches helped set the mood for the day, but in a weekend jam packed with tons of friends, family and July 4th barbecues, fun was a guarantee. Add a beautiful wedding and that there is a weekend you ll never forget. Thankfully T & S Hughes Photography was there to capture the heart-warming event.'
p503
aS'We spent what felt like ten (VERY LONG) months planning and brainstorming and more planning, all the while teaching, coaching and making bi-weekly trips to Chicago for Mark s job at church. But after those many long months, the weekend of July 7th finally arrived.'
p504
aS'We jam packed the weekend with barbecues, softball games, pool parties, time with family, a fourth of July parade, fireworks, bachelor and bachelorette parties and all the usual rehearsal festivities that exist at a wedding. Needless to say, we got the most out of every ounce of time out of our weekend.'
p505
aS'The morning of our wedding, Mark and I met for a quiet walk in a park near our house. We sat and prayed for a little while and then said our giddy, anticipatory goodbyes. Next time we saw each other, I d be walking down the aisle! I spent the morning at home with my three sisters and my mom, enjoying time together as a family and getting our hair and make-up done. Mark spent his morning running around Target like a mad-man, looking for a belt and socks!'
p506
aS'We had big wedding parties: ten people each! I also had seven close friends get ready with the bridal party. I chose yellow dresses for my girls; the color is a tricky one to find, but it was worth the search! I loved the bright colors against the navy suits worn by the guys. Mark, not usually a fashionista, found awesome wedges for the girls to wear. It brought in the striped ribbon on their bouquets perfectly! The guys wore ties I found on Amazon! We loved the unique pattern and felt like it gave the men a more casual feel. We spent the morning doing each other s hair and make-up, jamming to music and enjoying our favorite drinks from Starbucks! '
p507
aS'Our reception was filled with beautiful, crafty touches, courtesy of my creative Mama! We wanted a look that I could not find anywhere on the web. I love the color yellow, but didn t necessarily want a rustic feel. I wanted clean, crisp, bright, joyful yellow. I loved the look of yellow, white and navy, so we went with that color theme. I wrestled (almost daily) with finding the right shades of yellow, but eventually I found what I was looking for. My mom helped design the centerpieces: beautiful lanterns, decorated with flowers. We had a large wedding, so we didn t need the centerpieces to overpower the already full room. We chose yellow napkins to make the color pop and let the beauty of the venue do most of the talking! My mom made sweet vases of flowers from our farmer s market the day before and we spread those around the rest of the venue. Our florists did an amazing job of capturing the yellow color, while making it tasteful and not obnoxious. Our cake was topped by my grandma and grandpa s cake topper. We made table numbers from stationery and had our calligrapher write beautiful numbers in white. Each guest received a delicious homemade cookie made by my mom s close friend. Our giant head table (22 people long) was donned with candle holders of various heights. The room looked amazing.'
p508
aS'We enjoyed a joyous reception, complete with three beautiful toasts from my dad, sister and Mark s brother, delicious food, wild dancing and an amazing send off of paper lanterns (which may or may not have almost lit a tree on fire!). It was a perfect day. We were able to look back on other s memories through our wedding hashtag on instagram! This was one of my favorite things to look through. It was fun to experience that day through someone else s eyes.'

With its perfectly preppy palette and spunky pops of color and confetti thrown in for good measure, it s practically impossible to look at these gorgeous images from Lisa Hessel Photography and not smile. It gives tradition a good ol  glitter-infused twist, and you can see all the fun right here.'
p542
aS'From Lisa Hessel Photography  #CueTheConfetti was the theme repeated over and over throughout Shelby and Kyle s celebration because it was just that  a celebration overflowing with joy. The bright details and colorful flowers complimented the celebration, and just the right amount of confetti in just the right locations made the day sparkle. Even the bride s sparkly Kate Spade shoes were coordinated for the occasion.'
p543
aS'Thick letterpress paper goods designed by Courtney Callahan Paper set the tone for the event immediately with their bold, bright colors and stripes set off by shimmering gold detail. Most definitely swoon-worthy.'
p544
aS'Shelby and Kyle both grew up in St. Louis, Mo, but planned their wedding from their current residence in the South. The event culminated with a reception in Forest Park in the heart of St. Louis. Festive geronimo balloons tied with colorful streams welcomed guests to the cocktail hour where sparkling navy, coral, and aqua details awaited them.'
p545
aS'From The Bride While Kyle and I live in Dallas, we always knew we d get married in the city that holds our hearts   Saint Louis. It s where we both grew up. It s where we met (eight years ago as seniors in high school!). And it s a city with the most admirable spirit. Not to mention, it s the city that s home to our most beloved family and friends. To me, Saint Louis embodies everything I hoped our wedding would be. Classic, but not too serious. Vibrant. And thoughtful. Maybe even timeless and unforgettable. But mostly, overflowing with joy. Before we could dive into the details (my most favorite part), we had to find the reception venue that would set the tone. It didn t take long to realize that Forest Park Visitor Center was the obvious choice. As the hub of one of the greatest civic treasures of Saint Louis, it did everything it needed to. It was authentic, beautifully constructed, and filled with natural light   the most sincere palette.'
p546
aS'The ceremony took place at my grade school church, Mary, Queen of Peace. It s lovely and charming, but more importantly, it s significant and filled with decades of special memories. When it came to creating the atmosphere for our wedding, we really just wanted it to feel like exactly what it was   a big, joyful celebration. Confetti and champagne, peonies and oversized balloons. But in a way that made big feel effortless and just right. I wanted the styling to be refined and sophisticated, but also lighthearted and even a little bit whimsical. When creating the official hashtag (insta-addict), I borrowed a set of words from Kate Spade (another addiction) and it became #cuetheconfettiJuly13. On this most joyful day, we were certainly going to cue the confetti. And then some.'
p547
aS'The color palette included a classic, rich navy with unexpected and saturated pops of white, poppy, aqua, and of course, gold. Oh, alright, the gold became more than a pop. I couldn t help myself. Gold foil found its way into many of the details including the invitations, jewelry, d cor, and even our cake. The details. Oh how I believe in the details. Whether they add color, nod to a special memory, or recognize a loved one, the details elevate everything. And with the help of the wonderful Courtney Callahan, we had no shortage of those touches. Complemented by the genius of Bloomin Buckets, the d cor led the way. And we followed. And spent the majority of the night on the dance floor. It s not hard to get lost in the music when you have Boom! energizing the room. Which was a good thing, because in our family we tend to measure the success of an event by the crowd on the dance floor. And this was no exception (it helps when the Father of the Bride kicks off the night with a lively and unforgettable performance).'
p548
aS'Our first dance as husband and wife sums it up best. The kind of song that puts the indescribable into words.  Overwhelmed by you. And overcome with joy.  How we feel about one another. How we felt about our family and friends on that day. And how we hope we ll always feel.\n'

aS'From the Willow & Stone Photography   Although bohemian weddings have been on the rise lately, I found that I was continually inspired by the earthy and organic feel Boho weddings offered. Heavily featured with beautiful blooms and a lovely pastel palette, I dreamt up a stylized shoot that had a Boho vibe with a rustic touch. I wanted it to be soft, romantic, and simple, yet incorporate certain must-have s such as a floral headpiece, a rustic outdoor setting, several DIY touches, a beautiful flowing gown these things, to me, are the essence of Bohemian weddings. From there, I knew that I wanted to collaborate with the talented local vendors of Madison, Wisconsin, some of the best in the wedding industry. I met with each vendor, one on one, to discuss bringing my vision to life. Every single detail was carefully thought out, from the handmade candles wrapped with branches to the cake pops displayed in sewing drawers to the silk ribbon that adorned the bride s bouquet. This was truly a creative collaboration, and I could not be more happy with the outcome! '

S'When Rhi from Hey Gorgeous Events sends a little something our way, I know it s going to be full of pretty. This gal truly knows how to plan a wedding and in the process, builds the best relationships with her sweet brides & grooms. This summery soiree is a prime example of that. With glowing blooms from Parsonage Events, adorable treats from Sweet Heather Anne, a stunning dress from The Gown Shop and hearts sprinkled throughout, this gallery from Abby Rose Photo is packed with even more!'
p641
aS'From the beautiful Bride  The day started like I always imagined it would, waking up in my childhood room with the sun beaming through the windows, I felt like I was dreaming awake, what a day this would be! If you ve ever planned a wedding or are currently in the process I have one piece of advice to get you through it  hire a wedding planner! If it weren t for Rhi at Hey Gorgeous Events there would be no way we would of made it to this day or that I would wake up so at peace with how the days events would unfold. She checked in with me early morning to assure me things were running smoothly and I was free to be pampered. The year and a half leading up to this day had been long, fun, and stressful at times but ultimately an unforgettable ride. I didn t have to visit a million bridal shops, bakeries, floral shops, photographers, or venues. I was given a list of trusted vendors from Rhi and websites and/or portfolios that I could look at so that I could limit the amount of actual time spent visiting these places and I couldn t be happier with my choices. A picture really does speak a thousand words and our wedding photos speak volumes about the amazing people that worked on our big day, from the biggest to the smallest details everything was perfection.'
p642
aS'My favorite part about the wedding, besides marrying the man of my dreams, was seeing everything I had imagined come together and the little details/surprises along the way. I had a kid s area marked off by balloons Rhi had picked and blankets my grandmother knitted in our wedding colors for the kiddos to sit on. My sweets table was something out of a movie, with long strands of ribbon kissing the floor behind the most immaculate display of treats I have ever seen. The heart theme Rhi had set out to accomplish was carried through from the dance floor, sweetheart table backdrop, alter, all the way to the cocktail straws and cookie shapes made by Sweet Heather Anne. Our bars had a backlight/linen detail that allowed them to illuminate throughout the evening. Our lounge furniture was adorned with pillows that now sit in our living room in our home. The tables had mirrored candelabras that coordinated with our mirrored sweets table, silver ruffle chargers, and our centerpieces had the most breathtaking blooms and bowls of peaches representing our hometown of Romeo. There are a million things about our wedding that made it special, our well coordinated/meaningful ceremony, our family and friends, the breeze that blew through our tented reception and the utter ease of knowing I had so many wonderful people making sure everything went smoothly. I could go on for pages about every last detail and I cannot say enough about how much that day meant to us. The best part of all was that we were able to have a day that reflected the kind of couple we are and demonstrate the love and friendship we share. I never felt like I had to conform to a certain way of doing things. Instead of a unity candle we planted a small oak tree in remembrance of my grandmother, which is now planted in our yard. We were able to do things our way but in a far greater way than I could have ever imagined. I lose days and hours looking at my beautiful photos and each time my heart smiles. I hope everyone can have a day like we did, because everyone deserves a day like that.'

S'Any bride who rocks a top knot, a Vera Wang and the sparkiest Choos you ever did see is basically a fashion hero, in my book. But even more than her killer sense of style, is the gorgeous white wedding that followed. It s black tie formality at its very best and our friends at Paper Antler captured each moment. Have a peek here!'
p695
aS'From the Bride  I had always dreamed of a small intimate wedding with our closest friends and family. Well, my Dad comes from a family of nine kids and Blake s Mom is one of seven. So a big wedding it was! But, we were determined to make it an intimate wedding nonetheless. Regardless of size, venue, d cor, or price tag, the most important thing to us was the feeling in the room on our wedding night.'
p696
aS'As we started to plan, there were several must haves. First, was Paper Antler, our amazingly talented photographers. The day after we got engaged I reserved them for the entire month of August! We also knew we wanted our ceremony in an intimate outdoor setting, a reception with tall ceilings and at least one crystal chandelier, and a big dance floor! As fate would have it, the Hinsdale Golf Club, in the town where I grew up, met all our requirements. After picking a venue in my hometown, a hometown theme quickly developed. The bridal luncheon and rehearsal dinner were in Hinsdale. The flowers, invitations, and wedding cake were all designed by local vendors. And on the day of the wedding, my bridesmaids, five of which were friends who grew up with me in Hinsdale, and my sister (MOH) of course, and I spent the morning getting ready in my childhood home.'
p697
aS'In designing our wedding, we strived for understated elegance. We opted against using a wedding planner. But my Mom and sister were our wedding planner equivalents. My Mom helped us plan every step of the way and made sure every last detail was perfect. As a bride that hated almost all things  wedding,  planning the perfect wedding was difficult. I had never been a fan of big wedding centerpieces, bright colors, ball gowns, or even bridesmaid dresses. But, there were certain quirky wedding touches that were a must. I found two tacky porcelain doves that I instantly knew had to sit on top of our wedding cake. I wanted each table to feel like a beautiful dinner party, with a tasteful centerpiece. My husband and I both have always loved a simple white flower arrangement. And I knew from day one that callas were a must.'
p698
aS'We both wanted our wedding to feel like a special day, so tuxes and formal dresses were essential. Blake opted for a traditional black Hugo Boss tux. Picking the perfect dresses for myself and my bridesmaids was a daunting task. I had my mind set on an understated lace wedding dress with sleeves. On my second day of dress shopping I fell in love with a strapless, laceless Vera that was definitely not understated. The dress set the tone for the whole wedding. And I knew I wanted each of my nine bridesmaids to feel as good as I felt in my dress on the day of. I found two stunning beaded blouson gowns that went perfectly with a beautiful vintage clutch that Blake and I found while antique shopping in Chicago. It took months, but we were able to design the rest of the dresses around the two inspiration dresses. Each bridesmaid ended up in the perfect dress that fit her unique style and personality. My mom found the perfect Mother of the Bride dress to fit into the color scheme, and my Dad wore my Grandpa s cufflinks from grade school! Everyone looked stunning.'
p699
aS'Our ceremony was very important to us. We really wanted the ceremony to be about us and our love for each other. Our officiant was a close friend of Blake s who was able to give us exactly that. He knew us and our story and was able to tell that to our family and friends. Until we started wedding planning, I always cringed when I heard people were writing their own vows. But when it came down to it, we both really wanted the words we said to mean something to us. So the two of us stayed up until 2:00am one night and wrote our vows together, incorporating words from traditional vows with promises that were special to us. Blake promised to make my laugh every day and I promised to never lose my sense of humor.'
p700
aS'As a child, I made my Dad watch The Wizard of Oz on a weekly basis. So naturally, my Dad and I walked down the aisle to  Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  Blake and I left the ceremony to  All You Need is Love  while our loved ones threw rose petals in the air. My crafty Dad had made an amazing  Toss Bar  out of old wine crates for our guests to make baggies full of petals on their way into the ceremony. The ceremony was more than we could have imagined. The garden was filled with all our family and friends as the sun shown perfectly through the hedges that surrounded us. I do not think there was a dry eye in the crowd. We felt truly blessed to have such a perfect day.\n'

aS'From Laurie Bailey  Meredith and Oren were introduced three years ago, by close friends and family. Despite nearly 3,000 miles of distance between them (Meredith was based in LA; Oren was in NY), Meredith and Oren soon realized they shared not only a handful of close people in their lives, but they had so much more in common. Soon after they began talking, Oren pulled at Meredith s heart strings when instead of sending a typical gift such as flowers, Oren sent a gift basket to Meredith s family s two Portuguese Water Dogs. He knew the way to her heart. A month after their phone conversations began, Meredith and Oren finally met in LA, and have been inseparable ever since. Meredith moved to NY a year later, and an engagement shortly followed.'
p759
aS'It only seemed fitting for two people who were introduced by friends and family to celebrate their wedding at home in an intimate outdoor wedding. The wedding took place at Meredith s parent s home, outdoors in the gardens.'
p760
aS'Guests made their way from the cocktail hour held on a custom built clear floor above the pool through an archway of trees that led to the ceremony site. The ceremony was held under a traditional Jewish chuppah, a canopy which symbolizes the home the couple will build together. The chuppah was adorned with orchids, roses, and greenery and blended in with the natural surroundings. The reception was held at the other end of the garden under a tent with open sides, which allowed the beauty of the garden to be a part of the wedding.'
p761
aS'From the ceiling, eclectic chandeliers created a warm light over tables decorated with antique silver vases and candelabras. Little touches of detail from the monogrammed napkin rings, to the silver rimmed glasses, to the imported French chargers brought together the space which was filled with neutral colored fabrics and flowers, and most importantly lots of love. Songs played by Party on the Moon filled the air and Oren s special performance on the drums capped off a magical night.\n'

Set in the Lincoln Park Zoo s Cafe Bauer, there s no question you ll want in on this Windy City love. Press  play  to get started!'
p799
aS'From Foster Light Studios  There is a delight in crafting a film for an art director and creative strategist. Every detail of the wedding was particularly chosen for its character, color, texture, and shape. Shawn Jung, an art director at Jim Beam, and Stephen Vallera, a creative strategist at Facebook, had a gorgeous fall wedding at Lincoln Park s Cafe Brauer.'

aS'Greens and browns covered the interior and matched the colors of the building. Rustic browns of Jim Bean casks gave rich texture to an already deep fall time. Speckled candle holders and painted old wine bottles gave the whole wedding an immersive spirit.'
p801
aS'Capturing the subtle plays of light, textures, and hands was a priority. The delicate details, soft light, and genuine vows gave rich ethos to the elegantly rustic design. The music had to complement the care that was put into the design. Blake Ewing provided the first and last track that was delicate, melodic, and constantly romantic.'

aS'From the Bride  I met Joe through a mutual friend and immediately liked him. I know it sounds cliche  when people say this, but I actually felt like I had already known him. We have a lot in common in that we don t take anything too seriously. I think that was most reflected in our cake cutting   neither of us cared or even thought about how we were going to do it or if it would ruin my makeup or our clothes. We just had fun with it and that s what I love about being with Joe, he makes everything fun. The most important thing to us on our wedding day was that it reflected who we are and what is important to us.'
p839
aS'The first thing we chose was Via Vecchia as the venue, an Italian Winery in the brewery district. We wanted a space that was rustic, comfortable and unique. Via Vecchia was a perfect fit for us because my family is Italian and we both love wine. Many of the sayings, food and traditions at our wedding were Italian and wine themed and we decorated the space with olive branches, lanterns, chalkboards and old photos. Dinner was served family style and our families made cannoli s and Italian cookies for dessert. We really wanted our guests to feel like they were having dinner at our home. We wanted the tone to be comfortable and laid-back, and I think the family style dining and the homemade desserts really set the tone. For our favors, Joe made 250 half bottles of homemade wine. We personalized each bottle with twine and our signature tag that we d used on our save the date and invitations.'
p840
aS'Our favorite thing about our wedding was the ceremony. In Italy, many events, including marriages happen outside in the town square with people gathered around. There s something so beautiful and intimate about the simplicity of those gatherings. Even though it was a chilly November night and the only light we had was from a few string lights, we decided to get married on an alleyway stoop with our family and friends gathered around. It was perfect. Joe s older brother married us, and Joe and I exchanged our own vows which added to the intimacy and comfort of our wedding ceremony.'
p841
aS'Joe and I don t regret a single thing about our wedding day. We didn t do a lot of the traditions that many people do, but instead started our own that were more memorable and significant to us   and that s what we wanted our wedding day to be about!'

S'This stunning Bride s handsome Groom had his heart set on a southern soiree, but when plans changed, and they decided to host it closer to their now home   she decided she would bring that southern charm into their traditional ballroom wedding. So with the help of Two Foot Creative and Emerald City Designs, she brought the outdoors in, making all parties (including us) beyond happy. See all the pretty snapped up by The Shooting Gallery here.'
p886
aS'From the Bride I am so excited to finally share my wedding with you; even though it was seven months ago (time flies), I have decided I want to share it with you because I think it has some beautiful elements that other brides and brides-to-be will enjoy! I know when I was researching and trying to find my own bridal style, I loved seeing real weddings that were lovely and human.'
p887
aS'My husband is from Savannah, Georgia and when we first got engaged, we were thinking we would have our wedding in Savannah or Hilton Head. I loved the idea of a Southern wedding with all the fixings and Spanish moss covered trees. After going to look at venues down there, I decided living in Michigan and planning a Southern wedding would be too difficult. I am hands on and did I mention, I am a wedding planner? So yes, I knew myself well enough and what I wanted so we brought our wedding back up to the mitten. My husband, Nick, was a little disappointed; I had raised his hopes and then changed my mind. The next best thing I could do was to bring some of the Southern Charm to Michigan! Even though we had a ballroom wedding, we wanted to basically bring the outdoors, INDOORS without breaking the bank. From that point on, I referred to our wedding theme as  Burlap & Bling  when anyone asked. The burlap brought in the Southern charm and the bling made it slightly more formal since it was still in a ballroom in a fancy hotel.'

aS'Our invitations set the initial tone for our guests. They were cream with dark brown ink and had a burlap wrap. We incorporated the same burlap wrap and monogram throughout our entire event for consistency. I wanted to use natural and neutral colors in the ceremony space. We had mahogany chiavari chairs, blooming branches, hanging crystals and lots of natural light. The Conservatory was the perfect space to say our vows. The room is made of Italian glass with an Italian glass chandelier. It was early May and the trees had just bloomed outside, giving us an amazing backdrop.'
p889
aS' For our reception, I wanted guests to feel like they were transported outside and down South! We had three different tables with various levels of candles, mason jars, hanging candles, burlap, crystals, blooming branches, green branches and hanging lights. I wanted the tall centerpieces to almost feel like trees. My dream was to have cafe lights hanging over the dance floor and the design team made that happen! Half the tables had a floral appliqu  linen that could not have been more lovely. I also knew I wanted round menus to go beneath the crystal beaded charger plates. It was one of my favorite details. I had a burlap banner made for our custom cake table. We didn t have cake passed there were four flavors and I wanted guests to be able to choose the flavor of their choice. I also had a grooms cake for Nick; he s a huge soccer fan and his team is in England. Our baker made him a custom cake we displayed on that table. Another huge part of our reception was our band. I had them learn a few of Nick s favorite songs to surprise him. He got on stage and sang with the bad, it was awesome! At the end of the night, we went outside to do a few shots with sparklers. The Royal Park Hotel has this gorgeous patio on the river with strands of cafe lights above. As soon as it was dark enough, we headed out there with our photographers and videographer to take a few shots. These were probably some of the best photos we have and I get so many compliments on them.'
p890
aS'The Shoes: my shoes were my one accessory most people asked about. I knew I wanted something sparkly and fun, but just couldn t find the right shoe. Through lots of searching, I found these crystal Christian Louboutin s. Unfortunately, they were unavailable. I kept searching and found a woman who wanted to same pair for her wedding, but decided she could make them. I offered to pay her to make mine and she happily agreed! I bought a pair of Louboutin s and had them shipped to her in California. There, she HAND placed each and every crystal. She would send me photos of her progress and then the completed project. I was not only in awe, but had so much respect for her patience and talent. She then sent shoes back to me with extra crystals, a tube of glue in a syringe and a note. The entire process was seamless and worth every penny!'

Toss in a playful carousel, twinkling market lights and cotton candy and we ve got ourselves a full on celebration of love. This playful gallery from Blink Of An Eye Photography is sure to make you smile!'
p927
aS'From Blink Of An Eye Photography By Katie  Mary Beth and Tim are the ultimate travel bugs and always up for an adventure! Both have moved from state to state, each in different ones, and hadn t lived in the same state since college until their wedding. They were excited for family and friends to travel to Chicago, where they were living at the time. Guests traveled to the wedding in a trolley to get the fun rolling. The ceremony was tear filled with their personal vows and beautiful lighting. After the ceremony guests headed outside to enjoy cotton candy while the wedding party headed to the carousel for photos. When they knew they would be having the wedding at the Lincoln Park Zoo they wanted to carry the animal and wilderness theme throughout their beautiful wedding and opted for greenery centerpieces instead of traditional flowers. Guests were escorted to their seats by spray painted plastic animals. The reception amped up the fun with an  UP  themed cake, animal cake pops, donuts, photo booth, caricature artist, and ended with a glow stick exit.'
p928
aS'They have kept their relationship and life exciting by living in four different time zones, attending law school, running a marathon, and traveling to NYC, Boston, Seattle, New Hampshire, Vermont, Disney World and Mexico. Mary Beth and Tim recently moved to Santa Barbara, California for their latest adventure!\n'

aS'From the Bride  Basti n and I met in a castle in Chile when I was there doing research on love poet Pablo Neruda. Three continents, two years, and a lot of airfare later we made our relationship work, and we knew this day had to be a celebration of all the people who d shown us so much love along the way.'
p964
aS'When you ve got friends coming in, flying to Iowa from Chile, California, North Carolina, New York and more, you want to show them a good time, and also marry the traditions of all the different places that have made you who you are. We had a down-home Iowa dinner (miraculously, no one had a serious issue with the ribs and the formalwear!) in a prairie lodge, but then for dancing we headed back to downtown Cedar Rapids and mixed it up   a bit of Chile, a bit of Iowa, a bit of the coasts and everything in between. We were so happy to see people meeting, dancing, celebrating, speaking English and Spanish and everything in between.'
p965
aS'The whole day was about bringing people together: we rode with our friends in the party bus, and even finished off the night continuing the laughing, talking and celebrating with several guests in our hotel suite! Perhaps it s not the  romantic  wedding night, staring into each others  eyes, that many imagine. But for us, the whole weekend was about community, about love in a larger sense.\n'

S'When it comes right down to it, a classic wedding filled with a whole lotta elegance is the kind of wedding after my own heart. A handsome tux paired with a black satin bow tie, a lace-sleeved Monique Lhuillier dress from Rhylan Lang paired with pearls, and a bouquet filled to the brim with white blooms. With Jeff Sampson Photography behind every classy moment, this gallery has won me over.'
p1006
aS'From the beautiful Bride  I moved to Utah after finishing pharmacy school to complete a post graduate residency. I never expected to meet my future husband there. We had been dating for over two years when Thomas was accepted into medical school in Kansas City. We moved together excited for the next chapter in our relationship. Shortly after moving there, Thomas got me a heart ring inscribed with our initials. Six months later, he replaced that ring with an engagement ring and that s when the crazy wedding planning began .'
p1007
aS'There are so many options, inspirations, themes to choose from, making the wedding process very overwhelming. I can t really articulate what specific theme we had for our wedding. I knew there were certain  must haves  that I always wanted to incorporate in our (my) wedding: Thomas in a tux, navy and champagne colors, ceremony in a church, string quartet, calligrapher addressed invitations, chiavari chairs, me in a blush veil and a fall wedding celebration. The rest of the wedding decisions fell into place by complimenting these specific elements to create a cohesive affair bringing everything together. Looking back, I would say our wedding was traditional and classic.'
p1008
aS'Our ceremony was my favorite part of the wedding. I will never forget pausing at the end of the aisle with my dad, taking in the view: Thomas standing at the other end, all the guests, the flowers hanging from the pews attached by navy blue ribbons, the wedding party all in place, and the large cross at the end of the altar. I was overwhelmed by emotion at that very moment. The tears were uncontrollable.'
p1009
aS'My wedding dress was a silk satin strapless dress made by Monique Lhuillier. I knew I wanted a wedding dress with sleeves, but that style is very rare so the best option for achieving that look was to add a bolero to my strapless dress. Using the designer s lace, the bolero was custom made and I wore it for the ceremony and pictures. Getting married in the church, I wanted to be very traditional and wear a blush veil. We didn t have a  first look  prior to the ceremony so as much as my dress was a surprise to Thomas, I think he was very surprised to see me with a blush veil too.'
p1010
aS'Our colors were navy and gold with magenta and beet accents featured in the flowers. I loved the combination conveyed by the bridesmaids with their navy dresses, gold shoes, and pop of magenta colored bouquets. The table linens were navy with shimmery gold urns, candles, table chargers and gold chiavari chairs; all complimented by beautiful floral centerpieces.'
p1011
aS'Our reception venue was at the Museum of Visual Materials. The building had a lot of intrinsic character with hard wood floors and exposed brick walls. Our cocktail hour and dinner were both at the museum so we wanted to keep the dining area separate from cocktail hour by hanging long white curtains so that there could be a big reveal prior to our guests being seated. There were large open window where we designed candlescapes of a mixture of various size votives wrapped with gold twine. By evening, the lighting supplied by candles and twinkle lights gave an intimate, romantic feel.'
p1012
aS'We had a lot of young guests, so we made sure to have an area for the kids with coloring books and games to keep busy during cocktail hour. A photo booth was set up for after dinner, which was a huge hit for our guests. We had debated on whether or not to have one and we were so glad we did. It was so much fun to look back at all the pictures of guests and the kiddos loved it!'
p1013
aS'During the father-daughter dance, I surprised my dad with a slide show to play including pictures of him and me during my childhood. It was a sweet moment for both of us. The end of the night wrapped up with late night snacks made to order by Randall s food truck. We knew our guests would be hungry for something after a night of dancing so having the food truck available for chili cheese fries, burgers, and wings hit the spot!'

It has so much heart, I can almost feel it through the screen, and you can definitely see the love in the beautiful images from Rachel Joy Photos. With darling DIYs, a bridal party that dances down the aisle, and an entire guest list that couldn t be more excited to see these two tie the knot   this gallery is just the best.'
p1044
aS'From the Bride...  it is more fulfilling to live one s life within a circle of love  To love well is the task in all meaningful relationships, not just romantic bonds  (bell hooks, All About Love)'
p1045
aS'Adam and I met in high school and had been a couple for eleven years by the time we married on a muggy day in August. Having been through college and graduate school together, we had developed a close-knit group of friends, and we had been a part of each other s families for years. We set out to plan a cheerful, community-oriented wedding that celebrated not only our love and commitment, but moreso all of the relationships we have with friends and family that shape our lives.'
p1046
aS'First of all, we wanted our bridal party to be integral to the wedding. As far as the look, each of the  bridesbabes  found her own dress (one a year ahead and another two days before), and the eight best men picked their own vests. To keep things light-hearted, our friends danced down the aisle to  Dog Days Are Over  by Florence and the Machine. We think our friends are pretty awesome, so we wanted guests to be able to get to know them better. We asked our friends to be part of our wedding via a video we made while backpacking in Europe. We then asked each of our friends to make a video response expressing what they bring to the wedding PARTY, memories, or wishes, which we then played during cocktail hour. We also asked each pair to brainstorm something the two of them have in common, which contributed to their introductions at the reception.'
p1047
aS'Our families not only helped with MANY of the handmade details, such as the cloth napkins, wooden signs, beautifully decorated cookies, seating display, and a hundred twine balls, but they also took part in our wedding ceremony. Each of our four sets of parents and two sets of grandparents expressed a wish for us at the ceremony. We also highlighted all of our parents  and grandparents  very own parents by blowing up black-and-white photos to poster size and displaying them all over one of the barn walls. Furthermore, each of our families contributed a set of plates, which we used for dinner, and guests were instructed to turn their plates over to discover a label identifying whom their plate belonged to.'
p1048
aS'Our guests were also incorporated in the festivities. With our invitations, we sent blank quilt squares and asked guests to decorate them at home and bring them to the ceremony. After talking about the importance of community, we then invited all of our guests to file up for hugs as we collected the squares. We also asked each couple or family to write us a message on a chalkboard, which a friend then snapped polaroids of in lieu of a guestbook.'
p1049
aS'We used very few vendors for our event because friends and family pitched in to officiate our wedding, DJ, make the cake, arrange the flowers, and decorate the entire barn day-of. Every detail was lovingly designed. The party didn t stop after the wedding, either. Everyone reconvened the following day for a cook-out at my dad s house, complete with a wiffle ball game and live music performed by my brother. Later that evening, we set off wish lanterns over the lake and had a giant group sleepover for the third night in a row.'
p1050
aS'The wedding was ultimately so much more than the little details (or as one guest said,  Pinterest on steroids ); the experience of collaborating with Adam to create an intentional day that involved so many of the people we love was truly healing. By the end of the weekend, there was a collective sense of pride regarding the event that everyone had a hand in, and new bonds were formed between family and friends. Our original vision was superseded tenfold. The wedding planning process was so joy-filled for us that I am considering beginning a career as a wedding planner so that I can facilitate similar experiences for engaged couples.'
p1051
aS'Additional information:\n We got married in Ohio, but we were living in Colorado, home of the microbrew culture. So yes, we drove local Colorado beer that is not distributed in Ohio 22 hours across the country for the benefit of our deprived Midwestern loved ones.'
p1052
aS'A local artist in Colorado designed our invitations, which were a set of four coasters, and we also used rectangular coasters from New Belgium Brewing for RSVPs. The artist also designed our customized pint glass favors and our programs.'
p1053
aS'We read poetry and feminist theory during our ceremony. (Yes, I have a Masters in Women s Studies.) We also had same sex couples dance down the aisle together, and we made a statement for marriage equality. To end our ceremony, two friends played guitar and led the pack of guests back to the barn for the reception.'

aS'Adam and I both changed our last names together. We took his mom s name because it is a nice middle ground, and we wanted to honor her role in our lives.'

And can I just say that the Bride s headpiece is quite possibly my most favorite thing ever. It suits her gorgeous vintage look and this wedding to a t. See the full day captured by Lindsey Pantaleo right here.'
p1107
aS'From the Bride  Our wedding day was something I had thought about for a long time since Larkin and I were together for 8 years before tying the knot. We wanted something sweet and genuine that showed off our personalities and my love for design and creativity. I loved the planning process and enjoyed adding elements that were truly one of a kind. The style of our day was whimsical, sophisticated, and a little sassy.'
p1108
aS'We currently live in Toronto, Canada, but we re originally from the Midwest. We always thought it would be nice to have our celebration in Rocheport (population 243) because it s such a charming town full of Bed & Breakfasts, with galleries, antique shops, and even a blacksmith. Many guests stayed within three blocks of each other. The mayor baked our pizzas at the general store for the rehearsal dinner, and together we walked down the cobblestone streets before walking down the aisle. We chose to have the wedding a couple miles up the road at Les Bourgeois Winery. The bluff top overlooking the Missouri River was an ideal ceremony location, showcasing how truly beautiful Missouri can be. The rustic terrace inside the winery served as the setting for our quaint reception while Ironweed, a local bluegrass band, provided the tunes on the bluff for the ceremony and cocktail hour. In designing the invitations, I was inspired by the venue, and I really wanted to emphasize its location on the river. We served pies from our favorite shop in our hometown, which was special since we spent many date nights chatting over a slice of chocolate cheesecake.'
p1109
aS'For the florals, I had something a little different in mind. While in college, I worked at Poppy, a jewelry and art boutique in downtown Columbia, Mo. It was there that I met another artist and now dear friend, Lili Johnstone of D fy. She made every single paper flower for our wedding by hand. She spent months and hundreds of hours making these one of a kind masterpieces into bouquets, centerpieces, and everything in between. I am so thankful for her hard work, and I admire her persistence on this project! As you can imagine, planning a wedding from another country had its challenges, but knowing Lili was in charge was such a huge stress reliever.'
p1110
aS'I wanted my dress to be something comfortable that was easy to dance in since I knew we d be breakin  it down all night! There is a dress shop called The Brides  Project in Toronto. They sell gently used, donated gowns, and all of their profits go to various cancer charities. I loved this idea! I ended up finding a discontinued style that I had pinned, and it was truly meant to be. I was alone at the shop (which is a house filled with dresses), so I frantically texted my mom and best friend for reassurance before the purchase. The sweet high-low gown perfectly framed my mint heels. I topped it off with a sparkly blush shrug from BHLDN and a custom fascinator from Lilliput Hats in Toronto. The beautiful bridesmaids chose their own dresses, and despite the fact that we had never all been in one location until the day before the wedding, everything coordinated perfectly.'
p1111
aS'For the groom, we went with J Crew for a stylish sophisticated look. Larkin wore a brown Ludlow suit and a chambray tie. The groomsman chose their own outfits as well, which were mismatched with suspenders, ties, and bow ties. They were totally charming. Lili also made their matching boutonnieres out of paper.'
p1112
aS'We were so grateful for our friends and family who helped on the day of the wedding. I learned to release control and trust that things would turn out perfectly, and I m so glad I did.'
p1113
aS'There were so many favorite parts of the day. From the first time we saw each other to having a quiet moment in the vineyard after the ceremony, to the loving toasts and the performance of an original song by the groomsmen at the reception. Of course, it s hard to top seeing my grandfather dance to Ke$ha! It was so special to be together with everyone we love in one location, dancing the night away. The day was truly magical.\n'

S'I think I ve died and gone to some sort of wedding heaven.  One that is rich in warm, fall tones and vintage stylings that are some of the prettiest details you have ever seen.  Think fab paper goods from Minted, gorgeous florals from Stems Chicago and a Cafe Brauer setting that will take your breath away.  Intrigued?  You should be.  See it all captured by Jen Lynne in the full gallery.'
p1167
aS'From the Bride  October is easily the most beautiful month in Chicago, and our wedding day turned out to be a perfect picture of everyone s favorite Midwest season. The colors of the leaves were those rich shades of oranges and yellows that just totally signify fall. Fortunately we were surrounded by the beautiful seasonal colors as we held both the ceremony and reception at Cafe Brauer, a landmark building in the heart of Lincoln Park. Cafe Brauer was the most lovely setting to give us that vintage, turn-of-the-century vibe we were looking for. I found the most amazing beaded Jenny Packham gown that instantly reminds you of another era, and paired with the birdcage veil, it felt very Art Deco. The flowers and decor were colorful and vibrant to match the season and the setting.'
p1168
aS' We wanted our wedding to incorporate our favorite things, so we peppered little touches in the details: sunflowers to represent my husband s Kansas roots, a mash up of Beatles songs for the ceremony, Scrabble tile table numbers, Chicago s own Goose Island beer at the bars, mismatched bridesmaid dresses, assorted rustic pies from our neighborhood pie shop on the dessert bar, etc. It all came together and was very us.'
p1169
aS' The city was so beautiful on our day, and the open-air cocktail hour overlooked the downtown Chicago skyline as the sun was setting. After dinner, guests boogied the night away  thanks to the fabulous band, the dance floor was never empty. The evening was colorful yet elegant, simple yet special. We couldn t be happier with the way things turned out, and we have our fabulous family, friends, and vendors to thank for that!'
p1170
aS'From Jen Lynne Photography  Shana and Brad are such a beautiful couple, inside and out. They designed this wedding not only to be visually exciting but true to their personality and style. Some of my favorite details: Shana s amazing dress, and all the different dresses the bridesmaids wore, the flowers, those cute mini-margaritas and the desert table was out of this world!! I love how they combined the fall colors in the flowers/decor, it all blended seamlessly with each aspect of the wedding. Not only did I love the gorgeous design aspects, but Shana, Brad, their friends and families were all so wonderful to work with! We really enjoyed spending the day with everyone!'

Think a gorgeous, loft-style space covered in candles and infused with romance like you wouldn t believe. Of course, the amazing Woodnote Photography and Robert Ingraham made it all the more stunning, and you can visit the gallery and read this couple s serendipitous love story below!'
p1198
aS'From the Bride  Jon and I met on August 9, 2006 at a well-known Milwaukee pub. It was on a random Wednesday night and we were both there separately with friends. All of a sudden, someone bumped into me and I turned around quickly to just say a meaningless  sorry  and the red head that bumped into me said  Ow! That really hurt.  I smiled and laughed at his sarcasm and we started talking from that moment.'
p1199
aS'We realized how much our lives were aligned starting with the fact that Jon was equally as obsessed with the idea of leaving the Midwest and starting his life in New York City as I was. That evening, I knew I found the man I was going to marry. I told my mom the next morning,  I ll never kiss another man again,  only we hadn t even set our first date yet let alone had a kiss. It was perfect and to this day I have a ring (that I now wear stacked with my wedding band) that has a number nine on it to always keep that day (well, really night) in my mind. The night I met Jon was, hands down, the best night of my life.'
p1200
aS'From the Groom  I have to admit, I was opposed to having a first look. I had never heard of people doing that before and it sounded strange to see Miranda before she walked down the aisle. Now, I get it and I loved it. Seeing her in that amazing dress for the first time was incredibly moving. I was completely blown away with how beautiful she looked. The tears flowed out of my eyes instantly.\n'

p1245
aS'From Greenhouse Loft Photo  Jenny and Rob s wedding was an intimate gathering of friends and family at the gorgeous Greenhouse Loft and it was truly a celebration of love! The couple spent the morning primping and prepping at the Renaissance Hotel and Your Stylist AJ made sure the girls were perfectly coiffed, while Shannon O Brien made sure their the first look took place on the roof of the hotel, overlooking the river with breathtaking views of the city, but Rob obviously couldn t take his eyes off of Jenny!'
p1246
aS'The couple and their bridal party, along with the fantastic photographers from Greenhouse Loft, then jumped in a Windy City Limousine bus and headed to some of couple s favorite spots.'
p1247
aS'While they were snapping away Food for Thought, Elegant Event Lighting, Exquisite Designs and Michelle Durpetti Events were making sure to put the finishing touches on the airy loft space. The couple chose a neutral palette, with hints of blush, which complimented the space perfectly. Jenny and Rob really put their own design flair into this day, designing all the day of collateral themselves! The programs were perfectly personal, the table numbers all had items that were special to the couple (like Jenny s fond memories of 2% milk at her grandmother s house) and the seating chart was practically a feat of engineering that Rob put together!'
p1248
aS'The ceremony was a personal, tear-jerking event, with a good friend acting as the officiant. Jenny and Rob said  I Do  and they headed outside to the Greenhouse Loft garden to enjoy the beautiful summer weather and signature drinks of Moscow Mule and Rum Punch. They even had personalized bags boards for guests to enjoy! Dinner was a buffet of delicious fare by Food for Thought and everyone ate and drank and enjoyed themselves.'
p1249
aS'The loft really came alive in the evening, with the soft, pink lighting done by Elegant Event Lighting illuminating all the sweet details, like the low blush and white arrangements by Exquisite Designs. Jenny s floral dreams came true with hydrangeas, roses and dahlias, complimented with lots of candlelight. Tipsy Cake created one of the sweetest cakes we ve seen, with a lovely modern flair, and the couple loved cutting in! Guests danced the night away to Style Matters and the dream day was complete!'

And when they tie the knot in a styled-filled soiree like this adorable duo, I couldn t love them more. Coordinated by Bliss Weddings And Events and captured by Olivia Leigh Photographie, it s safe to say that the beginning of their next chapter had one stylish start. See it all here.'
p1281
aS'From  Olivia Leigh Photographie Erin and Eric are high school sweethearts who had the most lovely summer wedding! They married near their hometown, on the north shore of Chicago, at the lovely Chicago Botanic Garden. In a month that is usually sweltering, they had the most perfect weather, with not a cloud in the sky and a light breeze. They married in the rose garden, where Jesse Deckard of Bliss Weddings & Events and HMR Designs created the most beautiful design, with a cornflower blue runner leading to a chuppah with a cascading blooms. Guests enjoyed fresh fruit-infused water before being seated with custom program fans. After their emotional ceremony, a great cocktail hour followed in the English walled garden before guests were led to the reception tent that was beautifully transformed into a summer garden feel, with ivy cascading from the ceiling and a custom bar and chairs decked out with the couples  little name for each other    e squared  (too cute). Guests partied the night away and then enjoyed great cake and ice cream from a custom ice cream cart.\n'

The ultra-cool venue (the newly opened Langham Chicago), the adorable bride and groom (who first met all the way back in high school) and the crazy gorgeous stylings with a little ode to Sex and the City.  And, believe it or not, that s just the beginning of the pretty.  See soooo much more captured by Britta Hundertmark in the full gallery.'
p1365
aS'From the Groom  We met in high school through swimming and dated for two to three months. After high school we kept in touch, but started to talk more frequently starting in 2010. After a date in 2011, our relationship started to slowly grow and talks became more personal with questions of life plans and feelings towards each other often being the popular topic of each call. Knowing that I (Eric) couldn t let her slip from my grasp another time, I started to make plans to propose. A ring was purchased and airline transportation was planned. After lunch with her parents, where I again asked for permission to marry their daughter (this time in person), I surprised her at work and told her we had dinner reservations wherever she wanted to go. 24 reservations had been made and I m sure that the other 23 still aren t too happy with me. After we got back to her apartment, but before dinner, I told her that I couldn t imagine my life without her and asked her to marry me. Although she didn t say yes, the emotions that were on display were a clear indication that she felt the same.'
p1366
aS'From Britta Hundertmark  I had been looking forward to Eric and Kristin s day from the MOMENT they told me of their plans to be married at a brand new hotel downtown. I know that it was a leap of faith on their part, to plan a wedding at a hotel that would not even be open until a few months before hand, but they dreamed it would be well worth it, and those dreams payed off.'
p1367
aS'With a strong desire to implement parts of her favorite show (Sex and the City) into their day, Kristin payed close attention to fabulous details, including her gorgeous pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos and stunning Kate Spade necklace.'
p1368
aS'I was so honored to be one of the first photographers to capture a wedding at the Langham hotel, and was completely blown away by the hospitably of all of the staff, and the gorgeous ascetic of the entire venue. This spot is sure to be an instant classic Chicago venue, and I look forward to shooting their again in the future!'

S'I love a good love story and this one touches on love, weddings and generations past. In the 1940 s, at this very spot, the Bride s grandparents met and fell in love. Now fast-forward 70+ years and a granddaughter and her beloved are saying  I Do . It s the stuff that movies are made of but it s all real life and a beautiful one at that captured by Ann & Kam Photography. See so much more of this heartfelt celebration right here.'
p1435
aS'From Dawn, the Bride  On the day of our wedding, I felt more peaceful than I ever could have anticipated and certainly more serenity than I had experienced in the two years prior. There were no fears associated job changes, relocating to a new state (times two), or major wedding planning disasters. We knew planning a wedding was work, but we had many more other bumps and surprises than we were sometimes prepared for. We had weathered through it and I was calm because everything felt right and it felt good. Life was great!'
p1436
aS'Bobby and I met in New York City, moved to Chicago together, and finally settled in Milwaukee where I grew up. The location of our ceremony and reception were very important to us. We wanted spaces that had architectural character of the NYC, as well as the charm and beauty of the Midwest. Our hearts were full when we discovered that our chosen reception venue was where my grandparents met in the late 1940 s.'
p1437
aS'Formerly a whole sale and retail hardware store from 1857-1957, Pritzlaff is now a symbol of love and commitment from one generation to another. I think the pictures of the Villa Terrace are easy to convince anyone of its inherent allure, so that was another easy choice!'
p1438
aS'For our big day, Bobby and I spent a lot of time on the details because it would mean that much more to us knowing they were homemade by our family, friends and us. Bobby created a beautiful sidewalk sign, my mother-in-law and her husband made homemade strawberry jam, my grandmother and bridesmaids helped make the boutonnieres and photo booth props, doilies were donated by friends and aunts, my dad made wooden crates, and I religiously collected vintage items to pull it all together. I also designed the stationary, most of the signs, and table settings. It was a lot of work, but I honestly loved it. When Bobby gave a short speech at the reception, he said  our wedding is like the suberbowl of pinterest.  Guilty! I spent hours on blogs and Pinterest ooking for vintage chic inspiration.'
p1439
aS'The entire day was magical. It was happy, emotional, fun, and loving. We had a first look and we are both so glad we did. It was one of my favorite moments. A wave of emotions came over us and it was such an intense, rich feeling! I also loved taking my grandparents upstairs of Pritzlaff for some special photos. It was like memories flooded my grandpa and I felt so lucky to hear him relive their past together. I hope our love is 73 years strong (and counting). Best wishes to all of you in the planning stage. Hire a planner, if you can ;) Our budget didn t allow it, but I so wish it had!\n'

S'Garden weddings aren t always tied to garden venues. They can fit in quite nicely with a waterfront affair. Captured by Swanky Fine Art Weddings, this celebration by the sea is ripe with pastel hues and loads of summer flowers woven throughout. It dances the line between garden, tent and seaside and it s all incredibly lovely. Have a look here for more and be sure to check out the film of the day shot by Wedit below.'

aS'From the Bride  Matt and I have always loved spending summers on any of the Michigan lakes, there are so many to choose from. In fact, we hope to one day own a house on a lake. That being said, there was no other choice than the Village at Bay Harbor when it came to choosing where to get married. The Village is a relatively new establishment overlooking Little Traverse Bay off Lake Michigan with countless beauty to offer. Our choice of location for our outdoor ceremony and tented reception was on the Marina Lawn Panel that featured gorgeous yachts docked in the Harbor. The owners of a few of these breath-taking yachts were even kind enough to congratulate us with the honk of their horns at the end of our ceremony.'
p1471
aS'The Village at Bay Harbor is tailored for convenient wedding planning as it offers on-site wedding planning, photography, salon, and catering services. In addition, there are hotel rooms located above the shops that only give amazing views of the surrounding scenery. One of the great features about having our wedding at the Village at Bay Harbor is that it gave us the freedom to choose any vendors we d like, which helped us keep to our budget. However, we did choose their on-site catering company called Galley Gourmet and we were not disappointed! The food was outstanding!'
p1472
aS'Growing up looking at my parents  wedding photos, I always loved my mother s dress. Knowing she had it preserved after her wedding, I asked if I could wear it for my wedding. After an excited  yes  from her, the only tailoring that needed to be done was making it a bit bigger and it was ready for it s second debut. And as if it could not get any more special, my 92 year old grandmother made me a custom veil out of my mother s old veil and let me borrow her beautiful vintage pearl earrings! But because I needed to fill my requirement for  something new  I bought some adorable vintage feel customs made flats off Esty.com made by Katie Klein from the shop BeholdenBridal.'
p1473
aS'The wedding decor and flowers (all done by a close family friend) followed theme with the dress and had a vintage feel to it. Our color palette involved lots of pale pinks, grays and green glass scattered around table in the reception tent. Following suit, pearls were draped over the centerpieces and various other decorations. There were a few DIY projects done for the wedding including the seating assignment name board. I took my inspiration for this from Pintrest of course and simply covered a large pinboard with fabric and framed it. Then, I had my cousin with beautiful handwriting scribe all the names on the tags and they were hung with a pearl tipped pin. Another DIY project we did was for the picture display. For this we actually just painted a wooden dog gate silver/gray and hung individual picture frames of us, our parents and grandparents to the gate. Scattered ivy, pink flowers and pearls were added for the finishing touches. One other special DIY project that was done for us by the mother of the groom. She framed an old topography map in one of their old vintage windows she saved from Matt s childhood home with a small cross placed over Bay Harbor. She then had a small plaque engraved with our names and date of the wedding. It was a beautiful key decor piece at the wedding and is now hanging in our home. All of our flowers were fresh and were arranged by our close family friend. Another great idea we did for the wedding were gift baskets for all the guests made by the mother of the groom. She compiled all Michigan themed products including cherry candies, instant coffee, soup, chocolate, cherry salsa and more. We also had custom wine labels made with our picture and a thank you note placed on the wine we gave to our guests in the gift basket. The wine, supplied by another close family friend, was from Black Star Farms vineyard located in Suttons Bay, MI.'
p1474
aS'To help our budget, instead of videographer, we used Wedit Videos, a compnay based out of Detroit, MI. Wedit supplied five handheld cameras to record videos mailed to me three days before the wedding. Then anyone of your guests can use these cameras to shoot different perspectives of the wedding events. Once the wedding is over you simply mail back the cameras in the pre-paid box and all the video footage is uploaded on-line to your Wedit account. After that, you may choose to pay a little extra and have Wedit put together a video for you or what I did was I downloaded all the footage to my computer and made my own personal highlights reel video using iMovie and also a ceremony video. It was so awesome and simple. It really gave a cool and personal feel to the videos through our guests eyes. We are so happy we went with Wedit, especially because our wedding events included a whole weekend of events.'
p1475
aS'Overall, the whole wedding weekend was a dream. We were blessed with the perfect weather for an outdoor, Northern Michigan wedding. With our smaller 100 guest group, many people were able to make a mini vaca out of it, especially since it was Labor Day weekend. After the rehearsal dinner in downtown Petoskey (about 5 min away) friday night, we had an on-site bon fire on the public beach in between the Village at Bay Harbor and the Inn at Bay Harbor. We provided pizza and beverages for our guests there and it gave us another way to be able to spend time with our close friends and family. The wedding took place on Saturday and then to end the weekend we also had a goodbye brunch for all the guests at the Original House of Pancakes located on-site at the Village at Bay Harbor on Sunday morning. Many of our guests stayed at the on-site hotels at the Village at Bay Harbor including us and the rooms were wonderful. Megan and Melinda were two of the main people that work at The Village and helped us with many details of the wedding. They were amazing! Both were very helpful and more than happy to answer all our questions and concerns. If I had to do it all over, I wouldn t change a thing. It was perfect.\n'

S'Whether your style preferences fall more towards modern, or perhaps you re a lover of all things vintage, one thing is certain: a gorgeous wedding is a gorgeous wedding. And this? This is most assuredly a gorgeous wedding. Photographed by Katie Stoops, along with bright florals by Petals & Hedges and vintage styling by Something Vintage Rentals, the true love and beauty of this day shines extra bright   see it all right here.'
p1515
aS'From the Bride  We had searched and searched for locations that were not only vineyards but they also needed a rustic chic outdoorsy feel.When we arrived at The Barns at Hamilton Station that s exactly what we found. We loved it! Another great thing for us was it was only about an hour or so from the city which meant all of our guest could make it no problem. On top of all of that, the staff at the Barns are absolutely wonderful to work with. We couldn t have found a better place for our wedding.'
p1516
aS'The whole day was my favorite, but two parts stood out. The first was me hiding in the farm house watching Ray get out of his truck looking all handsome in his kilt. I was so,so, SO excited that I was getting to marry my very best friend. The second was when Ray and I were standing outside of the dining area waiting to be introduced. We finally had a moment to ourselves to just be quietly together. He said some of the sweetest things to me in those 5 minuets before returning to the fabulous wedding whirlwind. Definitely my two favorite moments.'
p1517
aS'Favorite part about planning: This is a hard one! I am so, so grateful for my wonderful mother and our amazing wedding team. If it was not for them I probably would still be planning our wedding. I think my favorite part was dress shopping with my mom. She was a trooper! My sister lives in Illinois and all of my best friends are out of state. So she had to be like 6 people in one. I finally settled on the 4th dress I bought after months of searching (OMG that s crazy to think I went through so many dresses!). I also really enjoyed the small things like wine tasting with my dad & step-mom and trying out different caters with Ray or even putting together our music for the dj. It s fun to be able to spend time with loved ones while planning a huge life event.'
p1518
aS'Advice to couples planning: ASK FOR HELP. This is such a big day for the couple and I know every bride wants things to be perfect. I know for a fact that if I didn t have my family and our wedding team I would have struggled through the planning. I went in with a plan to do a lot of things myself (flowers, cakes, take home gifts) and I am happy that I let other people take over those task for me. Working a demanding full-time job and having to find time to plan is next to impossible. I know I would have been such a wreck before the wedding if I was up all night doing flower arrangements or icing a wedding cake.\n'

aS'From the Bride  We didn t exactly have a theme for our wedding   the venues that we chose had so much personality that I wanted them to shine. The ceremony site, Villa Terrace, has a beautiful garden and courtyard which inspired me to incorporate that idea into the floral arrangements and bouquets. Throughout our engagement I had collected all of the amber vases, mostly from different antique stores and flea markets in the Milwaukee area. My Mom and Aunt, both who live in Michigan, also contributed to the collection of vases as they found them. I had an amazing florist who worked with the vases and my vision of organic seasonal arrangements   she made everything better and more beautiful than I could have imagined!\n I tried to do as much DIY as I could, from the table numbers and escort cards, to the advice hearts and the invitations- we tried to pinch pennies in as many places as possible, so I taught myself calligraphy to address the invitations that we used Photoshop to make and then printed at home- I learned a lot in the process!\n From the get-go I knew that I wanted my girls to wear different dresses. To make sure that they still went together, I decided on gold and then found a handful of dresses online from which they could choose, it was actually a very simple process! They looked so beautiful together and I was happy that each of their personalities and style could come through. For the boys we decided to forgo traditional boutonni res in favor of unique pocket squares. I made them myself and pre-folded them a few days ahead of time so that they didn t have to struggle with them the day of; I think they looked really great!\n Nick and I decided to write our own vows, we wanted the ceremony to be very personal and heartfelt and I think we achieved that. I think each of our vows complimented the other so well and the ceremony was my favorite part of the wedding- which says a lot because our reception was a blast! We danced all night and had such a good time with all of our family and friends- most of who came from our home state of Michigan. We had a fairly small wedding- 85 people, but it was the perfect amount to be able to talk to and enjoy everyone. It was the best wedding I could have ever imagined, especially now that I am married to the man of my dreams!\n'

aS'This GORGEOUS vineyard wedding of Aubree & Dave took place at the adorable and beautiful Willow Harbor Vineyard in Michigan. A perfect little destination wedding spot for couples opting for a more localized spot. What s great about this particular venue is that not only is it incredibly scenic, but they have so many spots for you to utilize, like the great little bridal cottage and the cigar bar for guests. As luck would have it, just as the ceremony began, it started to rain. And I mean REALLY rain! But nothing could stop these two lovebirds from tying the knot, so their love warmed up everyone enough to sit under their umbrellas and watch such a beautiful unity take place. Aubree surprised Dave by arriving in a horse and carriage, which really took his breath away. It seemed like the scene came right out of a movie, like the Notebook. Of course, as they were driven away in the horse and carriage, the rain stopped and sun came out, just in time for some beautiful portraits around the grounds. That evening, their reception took place under the twinkly lit umbrella with beautiful rustic decor. The night concluded with a lantern send off   a true fairy tale ending to a wonderful day.\n'

p1640
aS'From the Bride  Our story has so many one-in-a-million unexpected moments, and I knew our wedding wouldn t be much different. Peter and I met at a pub in Dallas (where he just so happened to be transferred for work temporarily) where we had both never visited, on a Thursday night, while I was celebrating my acceptance to grad school. Even though I was moving soon, we decided to give a relationship a try. After over two years of having a long-distance relationship, Peter decided to propose during one of my summer visits to see him. He completely went over the top, and got down on one knee in a hot air balloon while we were viewing the Sierra Nevada Mountains. With my new amazing custom ring (a French cut black diamond with a pave setting) to set the stage, I began to dream about the wedding.'
p1641
aS'I come from a long lineage of creative  makers  that fabricate with their hands through many mediums. I m formally trained as an architect, and I ve had an affinity for small delightful details for as long as I can remember, and I knew I wanted to have my hands in the whole design process. The foundation of my design ideas for the wedding began with my dress. After trying on a multitude of dresses that just didn t feel like  me  I finally found the one, but it still needed a little something else. I love the avant-garde feel of monotone color palettes with textured materials, and decided I wanted my dress dyed ombre gray. Thus our colors became gray and white, with pops of green. I wanted the materials we used, and where we were to be in their  essence  and show organic wear and patina.'
p1642
aS'This wedding was a true collaboration of many friends and family. It would not have been possible without many  snack & wine  bribes for endless fabric cutting and many DIY projects. We wanted our wedding to be as if we were inviting everyone over for dinner and wanted one long table, so we kept it to a small 60 person count. As an architect, the intimacy of the space we would hold the reception in was very important to me. We chose the venue because of its beauty and natural phenomena of the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers as well as the antiquity of the barn.'
p1643
aS'Our first look was one of my favorite parts, as Peter knew my dress was custom, but didn t know what to expect. Peter is from Ukraine, and it was amazing incorporating the traditions from his homeland into our ceremony, favors, and reception. This was a true day of love, as my step father was the officiant and my mother walked me down the aisle (to a beautiful Mad Men song called  Sally s Story  by David Carbonara). Our vows were a surprise, even to us, as my step-father acquired them from an elderly friend in his eighties, and called me one day to tell me he read them and he cried as they were so lovely and based on friendship. We enjoyed every minute of this day, and will remember it always!'

S'Ever since Vera Wang unveiled her all-pink bridal collection this Fall I ve been waiting on pins and needles to see how real brides would rock it. And when Three Nails Photography sent us this Chicago Botanic Gardens wedding featuring one chic bride doing just that, audible squeals and gasps weren t far behind. Clementine Custom Events planned the whole shebang, and it s all waiting for you here!'
p1691
aS'From the Bride  My bridesmaids, sisters and mom and I all got ready at my house and enjoyed a fun and relaxing afternoon together for hair and makeup. For most of them, that afternoon was the first time they saw my dress. The priceless expressions (some tears!) on their faces when they saw the blush colored gown and details of the petal train confirmed that I had made the right decision for our English garden wedding.'
p1692
aS'From the minute I laid eyes on the Vera Wang dress, I knew it had to be mine. There was something so romantic and unique about the color that I had to go for the untraditional color scheme. The dress undoubtedly set the stage in terms of all of our styling, floral and d cor choices for the wedding. We wanted the evening to be a formal occasion, but one that properly represented the two of us and our families. The combinations of the black tie dress code, old English garden, crystal chandeliers, exposed farm tables and lucite chairs all helped bring our vision of  Old Hollywood glamour meets rustic charm  to life.'
p1693
aS'There were so many incredible moments for us at the wedding, but one that stands out most for me was our first kiss. That  you can kiss the bride  moment is always special and symbolic, but usually only lasts a short while. Truly, my groom could not let go. His emotions were so raw and sweet. He planted not one, not two or three, but four big kisses on me to the point where the applause from the crowd turned into giggles and an uproar of cheers. We had just come off two and a half years of long distance as my groom finished business school in Chicago while I was working and living in NY so this was truly a tender and triumphant moment for the two of us. I could literally feel his love and pride through the strength of his big embrace. We did it!'
p1694
aS'The other incredible moment for me was my father-daughter dance. My dad and I danced to one of our family favorites, a classic Neapolitan song,  O Sole Mio  in English, My Sunshine. We had dance lessons every day for a week leading up to the wedding to perfect every dip and spin of our choreographed routine to surprise our guests with a little bit of Italian drama and a whole lot of sweet and sincere fun between a father and daughter. The entire experience and time spent with my father was incredibly special and something that I will cherish forever.'
p1695
aS'Some advice for brides: know that all the time and effort of planning is going to be all worth it. The day of your wedding is unlike any other   everyone you love and who loves you are all in the same place at the same time, celebrating you, your marriage, and the coming together of your two families. It s really a beautiful moment. Enjoy it!\n'

S'Chicago is one of those towns where tradition reigns Queen. Where classic ballroom weddings are counted as beloved, where brides and groom embrace their cultures and their spunk with equal opportunity. And this wedding   held at one of Chicago s most gorgeous hotels   is nothing if not classic at it s very best. With photographs from Kristin La Voie   there is even more right here!'
p1736
aS'From Kristin La Voie This is the MOST STUNNING wedding of the year! Hye-Sun & Rafael, who s engagement session was featured on SMP, held the perfect wedding at the Waldorf Astoria Chicago. The hotel is not only picturesque and exquisite, but I love it even more for it s Parisian style outside (it really feels as if you are walking in a little piece of Paris!) What made it even MORE romantic was their first look where Hye-Sun rolled into the courtyard in a horse drawn carriage to greet Rafael at the front door (in the MOST beautiful Vera Wang down, to boot!). It was truly breathtaking! We then had the couple ride into a nearby park where all the leaves were still the perfect Fall colors for their romantic carriage ride. Hye-Sun s Harry Winston ring was sparkling in the sun!\n The ceremony took place in one of the several ballrooms of the Waldorf ; candles and gorgeous florals with beautiful chandeliers overhead created the perfect ambiance to continue the romantic theme. Afterwards, couples entered the reception ballroom for cocktail hour and dinner following. The decor was more than gorgeous, it was just perfection!!! Everything was executed perfectly, down to the lounge corners set up for guests to sit and mingle. Other amazing moments included a violin trio playing for the couple and their guests, a Paebaek ceremony where the couple transformed into their traditional Korean clothes, and a choreographed first dance between the bride and groom. Planning and Coordination from Megan at North Shore Weddings & Events and florals by Ashland Addison Florist helped create the perfect, romantic affair.'

Their timelessness will never lose its luster, so when I see a classic wedding as gorgeous as this one captured by Cristina G Photography and planned by LOLA Event Productions, I feel like I ve hit the wedding jackpot.

p1779
aS'From Cristina G Photography As a wedding photographer you can t help but imagine dream weddings you would like to capture  As a Chicago wedding photographer, you can t help but secretly fantasize about backyard weddings and beautiful Sperry Tents  magical weddings that only seem to happen in California.Well  if there ever was a wedding I dreamed of photographing, but did not dare hope to ever have the chance to, especially in Chicago, it was Lauran & Marty s wedding. And yes, without a doubt Lauran was one of the most beautiful brides I have had the honor to photograph in my entire career so far. There was so much emotion, so many happy (and sad) tears shed, so much love, that it was hard to pick favorites to share.'
p1780
aS'Lauran s inspiration for the wedding was Southern romance. Southern romance under a beautiful Sperry tent! Navy blue and soft pink were the main colors and the actual location of the celebration was the groom s parents  backyard. Early fall   a warm September evening. Lots of champagne flowing in beautiful flutes adorned with navy and white straws with little flags inscribed with the guests  names   these served a double purpose   toast and find your seat! Paper lanterns and pretty dahlia and ranunculus centerpieces welcomed the guests inside the tent. The bridesmaids wore short Amsale navy blue dresses and the tiny ring bearer matched the theme perfectly in his light blue seersucker pants and newsboy hat!\n'

aS'From Katherine Salvatori Photography  Suzy and Roger have been together for over 10 years, and were so excited to finally be tying the knot this past August. They wanted a rustic and romantic lovebirds theme, and the Seven Bridges Golf Club was the perfect setting with the outdoor ceremony and dark wood reception space. I loved the pink peonies complimented by darker shades of purple and green. Suzy was a classic beauty in her Mori Lee gown, and I love the DIY birdcage veil made by her close friend. This was such an intimate, sweet wedding celebrating a decade of love, and I am so happy I could be a part of it!\n'

S'There s something about a modern wedding that pulls me in EVERY time. The clean lines, the crisp design and the effortless infusion of style everywhere you look.

Meagan (and) Nate + Village Video Productions captured the day and you can click right here for so much more.'
p1872
aS'From the Bride  When Shane and I met four years ago, we both knew we had found our perfect match in the other person. We were both family-oriented, creative, passionate and out-of-the-box thinkers. So when it came time to plan our wedding, it s no surprise that all of those attributes poured into design of each aspect of our wedding day.'
p1873
aS'For our style, we always referenced the words  modern romance.  We wanted to maintain the beautiful, classic elements of a traditional Jewish wedding, but also to keep things clean and simple where we could. Our venue truly spoke to that dichotomy. The ceremony location was a 1920s style cocktail lounge, with black walls, gold trimming and leather tufted couches. When guests stepped out to the cocktail hour and reception area, they entered a fresh, clean white space that let the d cor speak for itself. No extras, no fluff. To us, throwing a great party is an essential part of any wedding, so we made sure to find a great band to help everyone dance through the night. Our caterer also did a great job in selecting foods that matched our eclectic taste and picky presentation style. (And   as a bonus   it was all kosher, to meet the needs of some of our guests!).'
p1874
aS'To cut down on costs without sacrificing quality, Shane and I chose to do a lot right out of our Chicago apartment. We designed all our invitations and stationery together, and the money saved allowed us to splurge a bit more on other aspects of the wedding. The design flexibility also allowed us to be extra picky, and incorporate design elements like a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired pattern, as an homage to Shane s architecture background and our life together in Chicago (after being long distance for 3 years!). Our escort cards were tied to a pack of four different postcards that I designed, some of which had cute notes about Kansas   where we are both from. We wrote our table names on gold mirrors from IKEA, and each table represented a special place from our lives. Shane also made the guestbook by hand, which was a hardwood book in which guests could insert notes for us to read later. His parents devoted hours to making a gorgeous chuppah that embodied our modern romantic style, and a large black & gold sign for our J|S logo. For the reception, we had the chuppah moved to be above our table   which looked beautiful and saved on extra flowers for the sweetheart table!'

aS'In the end, Shane and I had a perfect wedding day that we truly designed from the ground-up.\n'

p1930
aS'From the Bride  Although Joe and I now reside in Chicago, where Joe grew up, I had always hoped we would get married back in my home state of California. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and fell in love with the Napa Valley at a young age. Some of my most cherished memories involve wine tasting in Napa or Sonoma with my family. Napa was also the first trip Joe and I took together as a couple after we graduated from college and where we continued to visit many more times over the years. Plus, it is hard not to love Napa  fabulous wine, amazing food, and a beautiful backdrop to top it all off. When the time came to start planning our wedding, the Napa Valley immediately went to the top of our list.'
p1931
aS'We took a trip out there with our parents soon after we got engaged to do some wedding research and immediately fell in love with the Vintage Estate. The venue is nestled in the quaint downtown area of Yountville on a hotel property surrounded by gardens and vineyards. It checked off all of our must-have items: it could accommodate a larger guest size, we were able to have our ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner outside in a stunning wine country setting, and we were able to continue the celebrations with our guests late into the evening in an old wine barrel room-turned-event space.'
p1932
aS'Our two favorite things to do as a couple consist of eating (either cooking at home or trying new restaurants) and chatting about the day over cocktails (because we can never turn down a glass of wine or an Old Fashioned). Therefore, it was really important to us to incorporate those passions into our wedding day. The Vintage Estate did a wonderful job with the menu and created a cuisine with fresh ingredients straight from the valley which we paired with some of our favorite wines from the area. We had our first look and bridal party photos in the vineyards at a winery that both of our families love, which was also the very first winery Joe and I went to on our trip to Napa together many years before. During our ceremony we opted to do a unity cup, instead of a candle, and sipped the wine from that same winery.'
p1933
aS'I didn t have an exact color scheme picked out for our wedding, but I knew I wanted more of a natural feel given that almost everything took place outside, so we went with a softer pallet of white/cream, blush, coral, mint, and gray. For the floral and d cor, Sharla Flock and her team created loose arrangements consisting of roses, hydrangeas, dahlias, lavender, berries, and pops of greenery. They used lanterns, wine barrels, candles, wooden boxes, mercury vessels, and farm tables to compliment the rustic beauty of the Napa Valley. We wanted to do something fun and different with the escort card table so Sharla placed the cards in wooden crates filled with fresh grapes, which turned out wonderfully. We incorporated those softer tones and the wine country theme of grapes and vines into our paper products as well, which we had an absolute blast designing with Kara Gordon of Magnificent Milestones in Chicago.'
p1934
aS'Our wedding day was truly a family affair, which made it even more special and most importantly, fun! Joe s oldest sister, Jenny, and her band D j  Vu flew in from Chicago to play at our ceremony and reception. Jenny was kind enough to sing my processional song, our unity cup song, first dance, and Joe s dance with his mom. Those are definitely moments that we will cherish for years to come. Joe s other sister, Lauren, who is the owner of LK Events in Chicago, helped us throughout the entire wedding planning process. We were very fortunate to have someone that was so knowledgeable and talented with us every step of the way. When I first moved to Chicago I worked with Lauren on many of her weddings and met some incredible vendors that we knew we wanted to be part of our day. Kristina Carter and Aaron Brouwer of Vrai Photography and the brilliant guys from I Do Films made the trip from Chicago as well. Reverend Nye, who officiated our ceremony, also baptized Joe as a baby, so having him there to marry us was very meaningful.'
p1935
aS'We could not have asked for a more perfect September day in the Napa Valley with our friends and family. Many of them traveled from all around the country to celebrate with us and we will be forever grateful for that. The day was filled with everything we could have hoped for  lots of love, laughter, dancing, and wine!'

aS'From the Bride My parents were married at the University of Chicago s Bond Chapel thirty years ago this January. For as long I can remember, I knew I wanted to get married on that campus but Bond Chapel is a little small. We had a large wedding, so Mike and I knew that we would need a bigger church to accommodate all of our guests. We decided to take a look at the larger of the two chapels on campus, Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, and instantly fell in love. I don t know what I can say about this chapel that will do it justice better than the beautiful photographs taken that day  It was the perfect backdrop to our ceremony. Mike and I asked his wonderful grandfather to officiate the wedding. That decision, without a doubt, made our ceremony incredibly special for the both us. It is a memory that we will cherish forever.'

Mike and I are so grateful to everyone for making our wedding truly unforgettable; we could not have been happier!'
p1978
aS'A few other details regarding the day; I made each of my bridesmaids a personalized hanger for their dresses, along with a hanger for myself (I didn t see paying $30 a piece for them when I could easily figure out how to DIY them for about $3 a pop). I also framed pictures to hang on my bouquet of my grandparents and Mike s grandmother who have passed away ; we thought it was a nice way to have them with us on that day.\n'

aS'From the bride We first met at a softball game in the summer of 2009. Originally, I was going there with a mutual friend of ours that wanted to go out later that night. Ed was not playing softball that day, and we had a chance to talk and to watch the game. Later that night, the team decided to go out for a quick dinner and some cocktails. There was definitely some chemistry that night that was unmistakable. But, we were both seeing other people at that time so that dating was delayed for a few months. We both kept in contact, and when we met the next time, we were both single. We have never been apart since that time!'
p2018
aS'Flash forward this to September, 2012. We decided to make a last minute trip to Lake Geneva for some relaxation and downtime. We had made some sandwiches and snacks for a hike through the Kettle Moraine State Park nearby. There was this hill that overlooked the entire state park that we decided to climb and hike. We arrived at the summit and it just happened to be a beautiful day. After a quick lunch, we started talking about the evolution of our relationship, and how much we cared about each other. After he stood up and looked at the view, he turned and knelt while I sat on a nearby bench. It was truly a magical day and totally unexpected.'
p2019
aS'I ve always envisioned having a very minimalistic, but elegant, wedding, and I feel that is exactly what I got. White is my favorite color but I didn t want an all white wedding, boring! I stuck with white table cloths to get the simple, clean look for my tables. I didn t want any dramatic colors so for the floral colors, I went with rose pink, light green, a bit of blue and white, of course. Ali from Engaging Events and Alex from Exquisite Designs helped get the colors to work perfectly together. The deconstructed floral arrangements had a contemporary but elegant touch. For my bridesmaid dresses, I chose a very bright summer color, the designer calls it Fresh! And like the name, it gave my girls a fresh, sophisticated look. I paired their dresses with a bib necklace from Stella and Dot, and the pairing looked better than I envisioned.'

S'To infuse a beautiful barn wedding with a bit of New York glamour is to steal hearts left and right and change wedding plans for upcoming barn nuptials, and this couple, along with Cherry Blossom Events, has done just that. Chic from head to toe, the soiree was the perfect marriage of the two seemingly different locales, but as you can plainly see from Paper Antler s photos, it was an even more perfect marriage for these two sweethearts!'
p2067
aS'From the stunning bride  The trend in barn weddings for the past couple years has been  shabby chic,  so to speak, with lots of burlap, lace and ball jars. That can be very beautiful, but it wasn t for us. We met and fell in love in New York, and that has influenced our style and taste. We both went to school in Wisconsin, and that s also where Nate proposed. We wanted to bring New York glamour to our rustic, Wisconsin venue. We called it,  barn chic. '
p2068
aS'We took the time to research vendors, and worked with a lot of wonderful people who love what they do. Our amazing wedding planner, Andrea VandeBerg from Cherry Blossom Events, helped us bring our vision to life. We really wanted this day to be personal, and true to who we are as individuals and together as a couple. We had a close friend get ordained and officiate our ceremony. I designed and printed all of our menus and escort cards at home. My parents cut, stained and painted our card box and direction sign. (Thanks, Mom & Dad!) Part of my wedding gift to my husband-to-be was a surprise whiskey bar. I found the decanters at a vintage flea market and stocked it with some of his favorite whiskeys. I also wore my daily perfume Prada Candy on our wedding day.'
p2069
aS'Even with all of the planning and preparation, nothing could have possibly prepared me for the overwhelming feeling of joy, love and support on that day. It was more than we ever could have imagined, and we are so thankful that we were surrounded by our closest friends and family as we said,  I do. \n'

S'When I read that the colors of this wedding were inspired by a Parisian sunset, there may or may not have been a little swoonfest happening in my office. At the risk of sounding like a complete wedding nerd, there definitely was, but in my defense, I don t think a single one of you can keep a happy dance from working it s way in while cruising through these images from Tao Zhang!'
p2112
aS'From the stunning bride  Chicago is where my fiance and I both grew up, where we met, and live, so we knew we wanted a downtown wedding, but with a European inspiration since we got engaged in Paris.'
p2113
aS'With this pairing in mind, I chose a slim, modern silhouette for my dress and incorporated vintage touches with vintage bracelets and a headband I created from a necklace. I also gave my sisters and mother vintage jewelry to pair with their simple, flowing dresses (inspired by the colors of a sunset on the Paris rooftops).'
p2114
aS'We knew from the start that we wanted a no-fuss, all-fun event with our closest friends and family   which for us, meant holding both our ceremony and reception in one place. We looked for two things in our venue: amazing food and a chic, but rustic interior. Balena is known for their delicious dishes and incredible cocktails, so combined with their gorgeous interior, the choice was easy.'
p2115
aS'We loved the faux finishes of the restaurant interior, and existing decor of vintage books and bottles on shelves. We added personal touches, including our parents and grandparents wedding photos in vintage frames, and small vintage clear and mercury glass vases with simple white roses. I created a potted paper wreath for the cards sign and used a vintage frame as a tray. A local artist created our framed  guestbook  art which will hang in our home   another place we like to blend our modern and vintage styles.'
p2116
aS'To make the day extra special, our best friend officiated our wedding. We held our ceremony in the round, with a single ring of seats for our family. My fiance and I each read vows that the other had written in secret, and we topped off the ceremony with a champagne toast. A friend s jazz band made for an upbeat cocktail hour, before djing the rest of our event.'
p2117
aS'Guests enjoyed a buffet of Balena s signature dishes, and French-inspired desserts like pots de creme and french macarons. Perhaps one of our favorite things is that we can visit Balena (and it s delicious dishes!) anytime we want to relive our special day.\n'

S'Vintage chic is one of my favorite ways to marry.  But throw in a fabulous locale like Royal Fox, a few antique typewriters and a bride and groom who are as cute as they are crafty and it skyrockets to the top of my awesome list faster than you can say  I do.   Oh, and did I mention the gorgeous pics from Hannah Persson?  Because they re amazing, too.  Click here for so much more.'
p2157
aS'From the Groom  I m guessing it s not often these things are written by the groom, but as a journalist with a huge interest in photography, my wife Meghan and I thought it best I write our account of our day! So what s to say about our wedding day and the way in which our photographer, Hannah Persson, captured it?'
p2158
aS'To set the scene, you need to know a couple of things. Meghan meticulously planned most of our Chicago wedding from Tacoma, Washington, alongside completing a Masters in Occupational Therapy. Like most of the events in our eight-year relationship, it proved a challenge, but one immersed in ideas based on our love and experiences together and I have to take this opportunity to congratulate her on an amazing job.'
p2159
aS'Having enjoyed a long-distance relationship between Dublin, Ireland and Chicago for more than five years, travel was always going to feature prominently in our ideas for the day. After much ado, about a whole lot of things, we finally decided on a  vintage travel  theme, one which Meghan, with a little help from me, set about putting in place in the months and weeks ahead of the big day.'
p2160
aS'Meghan s realization of her vision was nothing short of spectacular, in a subtle and rustic way, as she named all the tables after many of the more poignant towns and cities we d visited together. The tables were accentuated with old, weather-beaten planks of wood recovered from a fence I tore down at our old house in Tacoma, old bottles were collected from locations all over the country, and candles and flowers completed the carefully presented arrangements. Some of the wood was also salvaged from a Seattle based non-profit farm where we both volunteered. Old cameras and an old typewriter completed the vintage feel and added a little bit of the groom to the occasion, while being driven to and from the church in her dad s vibrant yellow 1974 VW Thing was one of the highlights of the day, for both of us, her family and my dad who helped get it running again.'
p2161
aS'When planning the wedding, we knew there were a couple of areas we wanted to get absolutely right, and the pictures was one of them. We researched long and hard and met several Chicago-area photographers before finally deciding on Hannah. Before meeting her, we already loved her style and the exceptional results she had produced at previous weddings from viewing her impressive website. However, within minutes of being in her company, Meghan and I both knew Hannah was the perfect fit, especially given the amazing energy and enthusiasm she brings to her undoubted talent.'
p2162
aS'Pictures taken at stunning locations like on the train tracks in downtown Wheaton, Fabien Gardens and in and around the venue itself, meant we have a wonderful gallery of images to cherish and keep, and share with family and friends for years to come. We didn t make it easy for her, failing to brief her with our  must-have  shots and  what not to shoot  pics like she had requested, but left to her own creative devices Hannah produced some remarkable shots and her excitement throughout the day shone through in the amazing final prints we received, just a few weeks after the event.'
p2163
aS'From Hannah Persson  So many little pieces added to this beautiful wedding. Shane, the groom, is from Ireland, where Meghan, the bride, actually first met him! They fell in love, and Shane moved back here to the States. When guests travel far from other countries, it always seems like the celebration is that much more beautiful. The groom s dad actually worked on the awesome yellow VW for about a week straight before the wedding just so that Shane and Meghan would be able to make their getaway in it. It had extra special significance because the car belonged to the bride s father, who passed away several years ago. One of Meghan s friend designed the gorgeous invitations. The guest s table cards showed off the couples  love for travel, as did the table numbers, as each had a different post card from a different travel destination for the couple. The couple used to live in Washington state, so the wood underneath the flowers on the tables was from Washington. The bride scoured thrift stores to find all the beautiful and unique vases to hold the flowers   super creative! The groom loves photography, so there were lots of old cameras decorating the reception space. The beautiful old Victorian elegance paired perfectly with the eclectic set up of the reception space. The couple loves music, so they had a banjo and violin player during cocktail hour, then the amazing Lisa Rene Band, followed by a special song played by a guest on the accordian. Of course, the late night snack was fish and chips- also super cute! The photoshoot took place at Fabyan Gardens in St. Charles, which is beyond gorgeous with the arches and gates. So much prettiness and love packed into one day.'

S'Sometimes all you need is a little whimsy to get your day moving in the right direction, and we re ready to deliver. It s a vintage carnival themed soiree and it was captured by Kate Miller Photography, which as you re about to see, means big things loves. Big, beautiful things!'
p2201
aS'From the stunning bride  The sense of fun really radiates from all the artistic details of this colorful late summer wedding. Bright corals pop against the worn brown tones of the old Byron Colby Barn.'
p2202
aS'THE CEREMONY was held in a nearby park, next to a duck pond in a tiny white gazebo. Guests walked under an arch made from old wooden barn doors, where photos of the bride and groom were displayed, bride on the left and groom on the right. They were given burlap and coral ribbons with the programs attached to match the pink ribbons adorning the gorgeous ivy curtain and hand blown mint-glass chandelier. The couple sealed away a bottle of wine and two love letters in an old wooden crate, for them to open on their five year anniversary. (The groom had lost the cute painted hammers for the ceremony, so the maids scoured the barn for two dirty old hammers that they decorated to be ceremony appropriate. This was a surprise to the bride at the altar, and the couple cracked up laughing.)'
p2203
aS'THE WEDDING PARTY had their attire guidelines kept very lose. The bride and groom wanted them to feel their best, and wanted their ensemble to reflect the casual nature of the event and location. The ladies had a variety of corals to choose from, and the men chose between vests and suspenders. The groom s suit was from Indochino, and the bride had a modified Paloma Blanca gown with some vintage-inspired shoulders built in. The bride and groom both decided to get a pair of their  dream shoes  resulting in some fun minty pumps to match the bride s mint-on-teal nails, and some sexy wingtips for the groom.'
p2204
aS' Florals pulled inspiration from the foliage surrounding the barn, but also incorporated some mint succulents and brighter, more whimsical blooms.'
p2205
aS' The bridesmaid gifts allowed the women to choose from a variety of vintage brooches the bride had tracked down over the duration of the past year. She made sure to target brooches in non-mint condition   items that each had had love, previous owners, and most important, a unique story all it s own. This was meant to symbolize the uniquely strong characters and personalities of the ladies in her party. The groomsmen each received a set of cufflinks tailored to their unique interest and personality as well.'
p2206
aS'THE COCKTAIL CARNIVAL was very important to the couple. They have a strong sense of fun, and childlike personalities. They wanted to encourage guests to tap into their inner child and enjoy their day by partying the way that the couple would want to party.'
p2207
aS' Three games were created, each with a prize: Put a ring on it had guests throwing wedding-ring-painted  rings  around old coke bottles to win a bottle of the grooms favorite craft beers, Heart Breaker invited you to throw vintage darts at a board of glitter-filled-balloons to win a cake pop from the bride s favorite bakery, and A Real Knockout featured old cans to knock off of a wooden barrel to win some of Chicago s famous Garret s Popcorn. The booths and signs for these games were made and painted by the couple, as were the additional bean-bag tossing game and the giant jenga.'
p2208
aS' The carnival was full of vintage pieces including a technicolor sofa, a palette cart table and various seating.\n The couple had custom cocktails   a Pimm s Cup from the Bride, a Torched Olde Fashioned from the groom, and a Pie-Eyed moonshine champagne to represent the couple.'
p2209
aS' Mad lib style RSVPs were displayed (even the racy ones! yikes!) in order for people to read each others fun and funny submissions. It also to represented the presence of the folks that weren t able to attend but wanted to share their best wishes.'
p2210
aS'THE RECEPTION was a big barn party. Guests were to pick up their placecard from an adorably fashioned little cabinet on their way inside. The place markers were made to look like small brass animals, but were actually plastic childs toys that had been painted with a metallic finish. Animals were chosen to match each of the guests personalities as best as the couple could. From there, guest could choose their own seat at the table number written on the back.'
p2211
aS' Florals were meant to look  casual  and almost  found,  matching the tone of the greenery that surrounded the barn. The couple spent a year collecting liquor bottles of various sizes, stripping the labels, and painting the bottles details metallic to match the place-markers (note the Makers Mark bottle with the gold wax drip, or the Four Roses bottle with the golden rose sigil) Also included in the florals were metallic dipped balsa roses and gold dusted peacock feathers to harken back to the bridal and bridesmaid bouquets.'
p2212
aS' The cocktail bar was in the expansively tall and echoey silo of the barn. Very dramatic.'
p2213
aS' The cake was a 4-tiered buttercream rendition of Chopped Hazelnut Pumpkin and Strawberry Lavendar Champagne, to represent a wedding day that was on the cusp of two seasons, summer and fall. The cake topper was custom built by a woman in Cape Town, who also made the couples dog, Bonsai, so that he could be placed sneakily chowing down at the back of the cake (a fun little easter egg for guests to find)\n The dancing  well it got a little bonkers, a little moonshine-induced, and went on and on into the night. The sense of play must have really put people in a good mood, as the final remaining guests had to be drug off the dancefloor and shuttled to the afterparty. Mission accomplished.\n'

aS'Friday evening, after everyone got into town, Steve s parents hosted a beautiful rehearsal party at the Peoria Zoo. Guests were greeted with live steel drum music, cocktails and appetizers on the Giraffe Overlook Deck, before we went into the Zambezi Lodge for dinner, toasts, and a slideshow created by our siblings. It was a wonderful start to a wonderful weekend.'
p2264
aS'Saturday the girls gathered in the Presidential Suite, at the hotel, for hair, make-up, brunch and mimosas; and the guys gathered in another suite for brunch, bloody marys, and Tecmo Bowl. Steve and I decided to meet before the ceremony for our  first look  and photos. A little nontraditional, but we didn t want to miss a minute of the party!'
p2265
aS'Saturday s events at The Pere Marquette were hosted by my parents  The ceremony began at 5pm in the Cotillion Ballroom   a beautiful ballroom with a hand painted mural and intricate woodwork. Our wedding coordinator decorated the space with gold chivari chairs, white flowers and baby s breath. A string quartet played as the guests and our parents were seated and as our bridal party came down the aisle. After the ceremony, guests were escorted out and were greeted by butlered trays of our featured drink   a  Flirtini . Singer/songwriter musician, David McDonald, played as the guests mingled around the Cheminee Ballroom and were served appetizers, a sushi bar and cocktails, of course.'
p2266
aS'From cocktail hour, guests were then escorted into the Marquette Ballroom for dinner. Throughout dinner, guests listened to live piano music and emceeing provided by our band, The Mix, as my father, my two sisters, and Steve s three brothers, as well as one of his best friends, gave toasts. Our wedding cake was a red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. The room was decorated with gold and ivory damask table linens, gold chargers, roses/hydrangeas/baby s breath and succulents.'
p2267
aS'After dinner and the speeches concluded, guests were them ushered into the final ballroom (a return, next door, to the Cotillion Ballroom, which was converted into a lounge/dance space during cocktails). The room had soft uplighting, a white dance floor, and white sofas and lounge furniture around the perimeter of the floor. Our amazing band kept the entire room on their feet, even causing the crowd to chant  one more song!  at the end of the night. It was an amazing and memorable weekend for Steve and I, as well as for our families.'
p2268
aS'We absolutely cannot thank Beth Maxwell and the McKinley Park Events team, Lauren Wakefield, The Mix Band, David McDonald, The River City String Quartet, Nikki Pulfur at Pomp & Polish, Loft Bridal, Jason Groh at Lexoria, Cracked Pepper Catering, Steely Pan, Phil Hoskins, The Peoria Zoo, and of course, Chris Welch and his team at The Hotel Pere Marquette Marriott enough!'

Her palette was delicious, traditional, consistent, and very classic  bridal  in the best sense. We loved that she kept her perfectly peachy and pink hued party true to form by mixing in real peaches, garden roses, and hydrangeas among other pretty details. Oh, and the cake! (Photos do it better justice than words!) One of our favorites we ve ever seen! Really gorgeous Midwestern wedding. Since Lindsay owns her own bridal shop she had three (!) lovely, different attire changes on the day (not to mention the shoes.)\n'

S'I have to admit   I have been seriously craving summer.  But this gorgeous shoot from the lovely state of Wisconsin?  It has me remembering just why winter is so very, very awesome.  A sweet combination of snowy weather, crazy gorgeous colors and a team of talented vendors (think Kate Weinstein, Sugar River Stationers and Laura Timmer), it s the prettiest way ever to spend your Thursday.  See it all here.'
p2339
aS'From Kate Weinstein Photo  I am excited to share our Snowy Old World Wedding inspiration shoot with you!'
p2340
aS'Here in Wisconsin, one thing is almost always certain: if it s winter, we will have snow on the ground. Towards the end of winter, Wisconsinites tend to tire of snow, but all that white really can be a beautiful complement to a bride s dress and a winter wedding. I wanted the colors of this shoot to play off the white snow and the blue of Milwaukee s frozen Lake Michigan, and this muted dusty blue, white, and mauve color palette would be perfect for a snowy and romantic winter wedding.'
p2341
aS'When I think Old World, I think timeless, European-style elegance, and that feeling was the inspiration for this shoot. BHLDN provided their elegant Cypress gown, luxuriously paired with their Effie fur topper. Lizzibeth contributed the jewels to accent the dress worn by our model Katelyn Kosinski, with hair and makeup by Laura Timmer. The Home Market in Milwaukee s Historic Third Ward provided the table, table settings, and many of the props seen in the shoot. Sugar River Stationers created the invitation suite, and the flowers were a mix of hellebores (one of the few flowers that bloom in snow!), ranunculus, spray roses, garden roses, tulips, and privet berry.'

S'This couple chose to tie the knot on one of the most festive holidays in Chicago; St Patricks Day Weekend. But you won t find a stitch of emerald green. Instead it s a blanket of orange crafted by Big City Bride and set against the lofty backdrop of River East Art Center. The one thing they did pull from St. Paddy s Day? A happy, happy celebration captured by Robyn Rachel Photography plus a great film by Highway 61 films below!'
p2375
aS'From Big City Bride  Lucky in love, Jennifer and Kevin got married on St. Patrick s day weekend at River East Art Center. As many may know, St. Patrick s Day is one of Chicago s favorite days to celebrate   with a rambunctious parade and a dyed green river. Nothing about this wedding tied in the clich  elements of the holiday but it certainly took to heart the same sense of celebration.'
p2376
aS'Jennifer and Kevin chose understated design that so perfectly highlighted the beautiful architecture of River East Art Center. Their organic taste led them towards simple but colorful floral elements, corals and oranges, that popped on the green linens and burlap runners. The look embodied the spirit of the season, understated and unexpected pops of color amongst a neutral palette.'
p2377
aS'With such a calm and fun environment for their guests, the evening only got better when Jennifer and Kevin revealed a few tricks up their sleeves. With family such a priority to the couple, Kevin s sons were undoubtably show stoppers as they walked down the aisle carrying a  Here she comes Daddy!  sign only to be followed by the radiant bride. They truly won over everyone s hearts when Jennifer and Kevin helped the two little guys shine in the spotlight as magicians for dinner entertainment. With capes and hats and wands and disappearing objects no one could resist the adorable show nor could they deny the how magical it was to see the new family come together!\n'

S'So girls. I think you re going to kind of love this wedding. Because the  there is just something sexy about a man in uniform  theory definitely applies. Add to that a girl fit to be a princess, a stunning ballroom backdrop and oh, maybe some of the prettiest pics   shot by The McCartneys   I ve ever seen and bam. Love gone wild.'
p2436
aS'From the bride, Jess When we were planning our wedding, we tried to always keep in the forefront of our minds that we wanted the day to be true to us as a couple. We wanted our wedding to be beautiful, formal but not stuffy, fun, and joyful. It was also important to us to throw a great party for our guests!'
p2437
aS'We also wanted to showcase the military aspect of the wedding   having our sword detail participate as much as possible was very important!'
p2438
aS'Without really explicitly talking about it, I think Dom and I had the same vision for our wedding. We wanted the day to be traditional and classic, but wanted to throw in some personality. It ended up being exactly what we wanted I felt like an absolute princess, straight out of a fairy tale. I think in the end all that really mattered was that we were finally marrying each other, and finally had the opportunity to start living our lives together. The fact that everything and everyone came together in such a beautiful way made the day that much more special and magical.'
p2439
aS'We did a little bit of DIY, and had a lot of fun with it! I ordered the Save the Dates on Etsy, but had a couple friends over one night and we hand-sewed a thread from Milwaukee to wherever the guest was living to personalize them a bit. I designed the invitations (and had them printed by an incredible family owned letterpress in northern WI) as well as the menu cards. My parents and uncle made the card box for us, and my parents also made our table numbers. We made a customized calendar for our guest book (now we have everyone s birthdays!). We also framed a bunch of old family photos to put on display   a touch that was very important to us as we wanted to honor the people in our lives that help to bring us to that day!'
p2440
aS'The parts that stick out in my mind the most, were walking down the aisle with my dad and seeing Dom for the first time, the entire ceremony (we had so much more fun that we thought we would and were so, incredibly impressed with our priest), the hours of time that we had alone together between the ceremony and reception to just reflect on the day and the night ahead, standing on our little balcony watching guests enter the room (and feeling like a princess, once again!), and our first dance. I guess that is the whole day, but those are the moments that play in my mind as the  highlight reel !'
p2441
aS'If I were to share advice with future brides, I would say.'
p2442
aS'1. Have fun with it, and don t take it too seriously! Also, don t be afraid to ask for help or advice, but stay true to your choices and opinions and don t second guess yourself once you make a decision. There are so many options out there, you could drive yourself insane!'
p2443
aS'2. Make sure that you keep in perspective what the wedding is all about   the love that you have for the person you are going to marry   the wedding is just the gateway to your new life together, which ultimately is WAY more important!'
p2444
aS'3. Do things together   even though Dom was deployed for 6 months of our engagement, we still make decisions together, which was really important.\n'
p2445
aS'4. If you re going on a honeymoon right after the wedding   don t leave the honeymoon planning to the last minute (it gets a little stressful!!)'

S'Chicago was made for the classic ballroom wedding and when you throw in a beautiful bride in a beautiful gown and her perfectly handsome groom, what you have, my dears, is pure wedded perfection. Keren Sarai Photography was behind her well seasoned lens for the big day, and my goodness, it is so pretty! '
p2484
aS'From the stunning bride  Here s how it started! Matthew asked me to marry him on July 28th, 2012. We were both ecstatic and could not wait to start planning our wedding! We wanted to marry in the city, Chicago is where we met and fell in love, it meant a lot to us. A short month into our engagement, Matthew scheduled a walk through The Murphy Auditorium. It s location was just perfect, in the heart of downtown on a quite street that provided peace and privacy. The building from the outside looked like an architectural treasure with tall columns, beautiful stairway, and mystic giant green doors which captivated our attention. Once we stepped inside, our breaths were taken away. The attention to detail was impeccable: beautiful dome ceiling, stained glass, gold accents, and rich dark oak was simply stunning. This old glam jewel in the city won our hearts over and we signed on the dotted line right away!'
p2485
aS'The church followed next. Even though we both lived in Chicago for many years, we never visited one of Chicago s oldest churches, The Fourth Presbyterian Church. On one Sunday afternoon we ended up at the church and we were simply in awe! We new right away we wanted to be married at the Fourth Presbyterian, not only is it beautiful, but it also tied in perfectly with The Murphy, both places are simply stunning and the architectural details are undeniable.'
p2486
aS'Lastly, we had to choose a hotel where we planned to spend the whole wedding weekend. There are plethora of hotels downtown Chicago, however, only one stood out, The Drake Hotel. Just like The Murphy Auditorium and The Fourth Presbyterian Church, The Drake Hotel offered the old Chicago ambiance that went perfectly with our  theme  (even though I always said, I do not want a  theme  wedding).'
p2487
aS'Our wedding was a roller coster kind of day, but I wouldn t change it for the world, in fact I want to re-live it again just to experience the jitters and the love. It all came together perfectly and we were even able to incorporate a few Ukrainian traditions! We are so happy with how it turned out and our beautiful venues will remind us of the day every time we will pass them by!\n'

p2528
aS'From the bride Rory and I decided that the most important goal of our wedding was to create an amazing celebration for our family and friends to dance the night away! We LOVE music, and our relationship started by going to music festivals and to see our favorite bands together. We wanted to create the feeling you get seeing your favorite band at our wedding reception and for everyone to feel like part of the festivities. The day of the wedding was chilly for the end of July, but in the end it was perfect for dancing with the doors open, providing natural air conditioning for our dance party.'
p2529
aS'We got engaged at Yerkes Observatory, and we thought the building was too beautiful to not return to take pictures the day of the wedding. Ideally, we would have gotten married there, but they do not allow receptions to take place on the grounds. We wanted to make sure the ceremony and reception took place in one location, and when we found Horticultural Hall, I knew it was perfect. The courtyard felt like a lush secret garden and created a lovely intimate ceremony space. The additional contributions from family and friends, like my mom & sister making the place card/plant tags and my reception sash, my friend Kaitlin making  Smores Pops  for everyone, and Rory and I making little details for the guest tables, using my mom s antique bottle collection for budvases on tables, my friends at The Flower Firm making my gorgeous floral designs, it all made the whole day feel like a giant hug!'

S'This mother of the Bride might win for best Mother ever. She hand-crafted a modern paper flower wall. A show stopper that takes this already awesome wedding captured by T & S Hughes Photography to a whole other level. And when mixed with all white blooms by Fasan Florist, planning by Sweet Pea Wedding Studio, and a whole lot of yummy comfort food; well lets just say it turns into a celebration we can so get behind. See even more in the full gallery.\n'
p2580
aS'From the Bride  When we began wedding planning there were a couple things that my husband, Colin and I agreed on: 1) we would have food that we really eat on a daily basis 2) our wedding would be a genuine reflection of us as a couple and 3) I promised Colin that it would be different.'
p2581
aS'Colin loves music and I figured the best way to get him truly excited about all the pomp and circumstance was to have it in a place he felt comfortable in. We chose the Bottom Lounge in the West Loop of Chicago because it provided a funky loft-style space that I wanted, but it was also a concert hall and thus made Colin feel at home. Since the Bottom Lounge is actually a bar as well, guests were able to grab a drink or play the pinball machines before heading up to the loft for cocktails.'
p2582
aS'Food is very important to us and we wanted the meal to be laid back comfort food. Our cocktail hour featured fried green tomato sliders and Belgian fries with garlic aioli, which set off the evening perfectly. Our family style main meal had pulled pork sandwiches and smoked barbecued salmon with sides of macaroni and cheese and garlic Brussels sprouts. After the feast, guests were able to spend the evening either on the dance floor or out on the huge patio that provided an amazing view of the Willis Tower and watch the  L  go by.'
p2583
aS'The most stunning d cor were the huge panels of paper flowers that my mom created for us. She made them one by one for months leading up to the big day. The largest set of panels sat right behind our head table and fit into the theme of white grey and green and matched the chevron table runners that my sister made perfectly.'
p2584
aS'I chose a simple fit n  flare crushed organza dress, but I felt very glamorous in it. It was extra special because I wore my mom s veil and a belt that she made from beads off of her wedding dress. My sister also wore the belt for her wedding the previous year so it was my  something borrowed . My favorite moment was my first look with Colin. On such an emotional day, seeing him calmed me down, let me relax and made me remember that it was all about the two of us.'
p2585
aS'(Funny side note: the day of our wedding there was a death metal band that played downstairs in the concert hall! Luckily, none of our guests heard a thing. Phew!)\n'

S'Any excuse to slip into your wedding dress is always a good idea, in my book. And thanks to Carolynn Seibert, one gorgeous bride and her ahhh-mazing BHLDN  gown, we re feasting our eyes on bridal portrait goodness in the Historic Dole Mansion. It s just the thing to start your Tuesday morn  and there s lots more sitting pretty over here.'
p2619
aS'From Carolynn Seibert  Chelsea flew me up from Louisiana to Chicago to do a totally inspiring bridal session with her and then to document her wedding a few weeks later. We did her vintage-inspired bridal session in a historic Chicagoland mansion overflowing with rich textures, winding staircases and gorgeous light. Not to mention there is a lakefront across the street! Chelsea s style is elegant and classic fused with vintage; a serious inspiration for all style-savvy brides. This girl was not only a joy and a beauty to photograph but she was incredibly laid back and fun to be with. She loved the way her BHLDN dress flowed in the wind outside; so we made sure to spend time having her spin around outside on the sand to get the wind to catch her train and send it billowing into the air.'
p2620
aS'Her videographer, Jordan Imhoff joined us for a bit as well to get some footage of her to use in her wedding-day video (which I thought was totally brilliant!). What a great excuse to wear your dress more than just your wedding day!\n'

p2664
aS'Jamie wore an elegant vintage satin dress while John wore a navy suit with a quirky gingham shirt and patterned bow tie. It was great to see their style come through on the wedding day. The bride even had a custom satin harness made for the ring bearer their dog Fiona so that she matched the intricate details of Jamie s vintage dress. Fiona s  outfit  was custom made by John s mom.'

After they said  I do , Kerrie of City Girl Weddings put together quite the party filled with some of Chicago s best vendors that went late into the night! It all went off without a hitch.'
p2667
aS'Everywhere I looked, there was another beautiful detail that I had missed before. Vintage elements, the bride s dress, the farm tables, the un-fussy floral design that covered every nook and cranny of the loft, the modern white backdrop and every other little detail were what made this night so amazing. Jamie clearly had a vision for her big day that really came through.'

S'As a girl who grew up on Disney movies and got engaged at the Magic Kingdom itself, infusing a little extra magic in her wedding was a total no brainer. And from the light and bright color palette to a million whimsy-filled details, I d say mission accomplished. Ryan Timm was on hand to snap the Disney-inspired day and we ve got soooo much more sitting right here.'
p2743
aS'From the Bride  The description of the wedding was kind of like a Disney/Beatles wedding, which are two things that have really brought us together we sort of had The Beatles be the background music to our relationship, why we first met and talked to our first dates which is why we incorporated it a lot in our ceremony and our wedding cake. Disney has been something I always loved, it taught me my first stories on faith, trust and love which is why I wanted it incorporated on our wedding day and also we frequent to Disney World and were engaged there'
p2744
aS'The colors we chose (spring pastels) were actually from the cinematography of Walt Disney s 1950 s Cinderella and I think the wedding day felt like a fairytale. It was all about the details and hoping someone would see how much work we put into it from a brooch of Walt Disney on my bouquet to the mason jars we individually bought at antique stores as our centerpieces, the process of putting together the wedding was just as important to make it a journey and not just that one day it was a dream come true.\n'

aS'From the Bride...Matt and I met on eHarmony and after a year and a half of dating he proposed to me before dinner at the Drake Hotel. Both of us being transplants to Chicago, we decided we wanted a wedding that embraced the city in which we met and fell in love. We chose a modern black, white, and yellow theme that captured the Chicago skyline and had our ceremony and reception on the 66th and 67th floors of the Metropolitan Club in the City s most iconic building, The Willis Tower. The bridal gown was a fit and flare style with a silk structured bodice adorned with crystals and flowing skirt and train that fluttered with soft flowers that matched my all white peonies bouquet. The bridesmaids wore modern black cocktail dresses accented crystal details and crystal jewelry from the Left Bank while carrying bouquets of yellow tulips, roses and ranunculus.'
p2779
aS'To incorporate my Jewish roots, manzanita branches and yellow florals were used to create a modern variation of the chuppah which framed us in front of the panoramic windows in the Chicago skyline. My brother officiated the intimate ceremony relating anecdotes about us to our friends and family. The reception was held in the Club s East Room overlooking downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan. The tables were draped in slate gray cloths while tiered yellow florals and floating arrangements mimicked the twinkling evening skyline. A customized Willis Tower commissioned print commemorating our wedding day welcomed the guests into the room and even the cake from Bittersweet Bakery had tiers decorated with the Chicago skyline. The couple led the dance filled evening by fox trotting to their song  Lucky  by Colbie Caillat and ended the night s festivities by watching the Navy Pier evening fireworks glisten over the Lake.'

S'This Salvage One wedding is the sum of so many fun parts all captured by Meg Redenz. Those bits include a Bride going airborne during the father/ daughter dance to Abba s Dancing Queen, a Groom who hand-crafted everything from the invitations to the centerpieces and, of course, an appearance by the couple s beloved VW Bus. See it all here.'
p2826
aS'From the Bride  We wanted our wedding to be a very unique experience for our guests, so Salvage One was the perfect choice. Salvage One is an upscale thrift shop by day and enchanting event space by night. During the ceremony, guests sat in salvaged church pews and everything at the venue is for sale! Ken is an artist and uses found materials and images to assemble his mixed media collage. That is also the perfect description of our wedding; from the mixture of bridesmaid dress styles and colors, unique handmade centerpieces for every table, and the wide variety of chairs and tables used for dinner seating.'
p2827
aS'My dress was the perfect mix of elegance, maturity and vintage. The beading sparkled perfectly in the evening light. My headpiece was designed by Kelly Summers, friend of a bridesmaid, and my hair was designed by Stevie Cook at Tsubo Hair Salon. Jennifer Hill, My First Heirloom, reworked my mother s 1940 s First Communion Dress into a Flower Girl Dress for my niece Avery. Jen also created a satin gown for Avery to wear during the reception.'
p2828
aS'Music was a huge part of our day. Ken and I have enjoyed hundreds of concerts together and we both work in the music industry. For the head table centerpiece, Ken created a collage of our old ticket stubs behind a yellow vintage window. Ken and I both entered the ceremony to Bob Dylan songs, we exited to The Beach Boys, and had a unique sibling/mother/father candle lighting ceremony to a live performance of a George Harrison song. Forget Hannah kept the party rocking with 3 hours of dancing (including 3 unprepared singalongs with the myself and the bridesmaids). During the father/daughter dance, my father surprised me half way by switching our song to Dancing Queen by Abba, which resulted in me going airborne, not once, but twice.'
p2829
aS'Since Salvage One decorates itself, we focused on the dinner tables. Ken handcrafted 30 centerpieces made of found wood, music records, album covers, magazine clippings and splashes of colors. Ken and I also thrifted to collect hundreds of vintage colored vases, candle holders and mason jars for the occasion. Cindy DeNike from Coleman Florist was charged with arranging centerpieces for a wide variety of vase sizes and shapes.\n The cake table displayed 3 beautiful cakes made by Tipsy Cake. The table was adorned with music collateral. One cake was actually displayed on a record player and one cake on a vintage suitcase.'
p2830
aS'Ken created the save the dates, the invites, thank you notes, place cards, programs, centerpiece numbers and Just Married sign. All contained a similar rock n roll vintage feel. Invites were constructed from album covers, including a 45 sleeve to hold the paper materials in place then bound with grommets and twine. Thank you notes were inspired by Bob Dylans  Subterranean Homesick Blues  with a vintage looking-Ken holding a Thank You sign under the train tracks. For the wedding programs, Ken sawed records into 6-inch strips and assembled the cream pages with grommets and twine. Place cards were created from remaining record album covers, which also created a vibrant image at the display table. Table numbers were constructed with 45 records and propped on wooden doll rods. Cards were placed in a vintage toolbox with a handmade wooden  card  sign. In lieu of a guest book, guests typed messages on vintage postcards and placed their notes in a family mailbox from the 1940s.'
p2831
aS'As a parting favor, guests enjoyed Munster donuts on the spot or could take a to-go bag with handmade donut labels inscribed  Thank You For Rockin n Rollin With Us . And of course, our wedding would not be complete without our VW bus that has transported us on so many road trips and concert adventures. Immediately after the ceremony our wedding party captured one celebratory shot with the WV and our handmade JUST MARRIED sign.\n'

aS'From averyhouse  Ashley + Johnny s  formal with a fresh/modern twist  wedding was on August 24th, 2013. This amazing couple invited friends and family to join them for their heartwarming ceremony on the lush lawn of Wrigley Square before throwing a gorgeous prism-themed reception at the Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago. I ve include some fun facts about the couple below!'
p2898
aS'From the couple  Our first date (a blind date) was at Gaslight in Lincoln Park. We met for the very first time right out front of the restaurant/bar, which was something that we ll never forget. Ashley was a bit late (of course), but walked up smiling from ear to ear. Johnny broke the ice almost immediately by initiating a nice big hug. We had a few drinks and ended the night with a shot that Ashley insisted on ordering  the rest was history.'
p2899
aS'Our favorite memory together was the night we moved into our apartment. After months of searching for the right place, we finally found the perfect lofted space in Bucktown. The second we stepped into the apartment, we just knew it was right. Moving day was very chaotic as any moving day should be, but once we finally made it into our new place, we both felt this feeling of relief and excitement. Our place was all ours and we both knew we were about to start an amazing life together. We popped open a bottle of champagne and enjoyed a relaxing night in an empty apartment.\n'

aS'Hel ne & Alex met in New York City but recently started a new adventure together in Detroit, MI. They got ready at the Inn on Ferry Street before their wedding. A ceremony was held on Wayne State s campus inside the Mcgregor Center which was designed by world famous architect Minoru Yamasaki. That evening a reception was held at the historic Ford Model-T plant on Piquette St. It was a pleasure working with the team from VLD on this wedding.\n'

aS'From the stunning bride  We are so excited to share our very unique wedding day with you, complete with blending of very unique cultures (Indian, Southern with a twist of Chicago history), surprise daddy/daughter and groom dances, fun food and lots of sentiment. We hope you enjoy our pictures!'
p2986
aS'My husband Silas and I wanted a day that really captured the blending of our cultures  I am of Asian Indian ethnicity, however, was born and raised in the South (Georgia). Silas was born in the midwest and raised in Chicago so we wanted a venue full of Chicago culture and history. Since we fell in love and met in Chicago, we wanted our wedding set in the city. Union Station Train station was the perfect fit in downtown Chicago. I wore an Enzoani gown with a traditional Indian tikka pinned in my hair and draped on my forehead. My hands and feet were also adorned with traditional Indian bridal mehndi. We chose purples and blues as our colors with the hint of a peacock theme. We had our first look at the Conrad Hotel, downtown Chicago, on an open balcony which overlooked the city. We then took pictures on the bridge that Silas proposed to me on, Kinsey bridge, with our dog Oliver. Silas and I were married under a modern day Indian mandap with a wall of cascading orchids. We had a traditional american processional for the wedding party and my Dad and I, and walked down an aisle lined with floating orchids. We then were married by a Hindu priestess with a 30 minute ceremony. The string quartet during our ceremony were fantastic, playing more traditional American processional music (such as Cannon D for the daddy/daughter walk), and Elvis,  Can t help falling in love  for the bridal party. The favorite part of the ceremony for both of us when when the quartet played Bittersweet Symphony just as we were pronounced husband and wife and for our recessional. During the recessional, guests threw rose petals on us as I threw rice over my shoulder for my mom to catch (Called Vidaai in the traditional Indian ceremony-signifies the bride leaving the house). Next, our cocktail hour had special touches including food that incorporated all of our cultures (i.e. fried chicken quesadillas and fried green tomatoes, tandoori chicken lollipops). Our reception table decor consisted of vases of alternating sizes with floating orchids with the smaller tables having tall branched trees. My dad and I did a surprise Georgia medley first dance, starting with the fox trot to Georgia on my mind, then breaking into a rap dance after a record scratch (to Welcome to Atlanta, Ludacris) and line dancing (Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee, Alan Jackson-I changed into FRYE cowboy boots for the dance). My husband also surpised me with a traditional Indian bhangra dance that he had practiced the week before the wedding. The night ended with a great DJ mix, a huge dance party and even an after party at on of our favorite local bar. All in all, it was a day full of surprises, laughter and most of all, love as we celebrated the blending of many distinctly different, but equally important cultures.\n'

S'When you re planning your wedding, and you really want it to ooze the romance, dusk is it. Is there anything more romantic that that fleeting moment between daylight and night sky? (No.) You simply must layer on the love with candles and candles and candles and bring along m three studio to capture it all. Then it will be perfect.'
p3029
aS'From the photographer  This beautiful styled shoot is from an Italian Villa that rests on the shores of Lake Michigan in Milwaukee, WI (Villa Terrace). Our concept was for the wedding to be at dusk   such a beautiful and magical time of day, and also so fleeting. We conceived of a small intimate wedding where guests entered the villa and made a wish in the courtyard on behalf of the couple. They then walked into the main house, passing thru eucalyptus vines with their placecards scattered among them. It was then down into the garden for a ceremony lovingly ensconced in one of the arched arbors with hanging candles and bent wood chairs. The celebration was topped off with a intimate dinner at a long feasting table on the terrace.\n'

S'If my crazy heart palpitations are any indication of the special-ness of this wedding, you re about to see something off the charts special. From Untamed Heart Photography, it s all gold glitter this, industrial glam that, and at the center is maybe the best smile I ve ever seen!'
p3074
aS'My theme was sort of  industrial glam with a few other themes in the undercurrent.\nI love all things industrial. My original hope was for Philip and I to be married in a vintage shoe factory since we fancy ourselves shoe collectors.'
p3075
aS'The repeated themes throughout the wedding were:\n1   The colors: grey, burgundy/oxblood, gold and black\n2   Shoe logo (on invitation, paper materials at wedding, on custom pillow in lounge area and we played the shoe game)\n3   Games   we love games so we had a custom tic-tac-toe, Yahtzee dice, ping-pong and we gave away playing cards as our guest gift.\n4   Light bulbs: We had a light bulb paper clip in the invitation, we had hanging pendent lights at the ceremony. At the reception, light bulbs were in marquee signs, in vases, acted as bud vases and there was a light bulb curtain.'
p3076
aS'We were married in a beautiful garden by a small pond, but then had the contrast of industrial pipe with hanging pendent lights. Then at the reception, the room was all cement and pipe and brick, so I wanted very natural, neutral flowers with a pop of burgundy. We popped the burgundy with my jewelry, my shoes, Phil s accent color in the shoes he designed and then my bouquet had lots of burgundy/oxblood in it. There were bud vases with the burgundy color, the napkins were burdundy etc. Also, we had a gorgeous vintage burgundy couch in a seating area at the reception. It was one of my favorite pieces in the room.'
p3077
aS'Then, we walked down the aisle to  Mirrors  by Justin Timberlake!!! Everyone who knows us knows that we love hip hop and pop, so playing anything too formal just didn t feel right for US.The song  Mirrors  actually made another appearance later in the wedding. My sister, Lindsay surprised us at the wedding with a video she made. She reached out to all of our guests   even those that could attend who were oversees with the military, a friend in Australia, Greece etc  and they all submitted videos of themselves lip sinking and dancing to  Mirrors . My sister then made a music video out of all the clips and surprised us with it at the wedding. It was incredible and the most amazing gift and memory that we will have forever. Here is the link:'
p3078
aS'Secret Tricks well, since we were living out of state, our wedding planners was crucial. I would recommend a wedding planner to anyone getting married! If you have a full time job, keeping up with the timeline and communication alone can be overwhelming. Wedding Planners are god s gifts to couples planning a wedding. They also eliminate the fear of booking a bad vendor. Also remember, this is your first time planning your wedding, but they plan weddings in the area all the time and know all the vendors and their strengths and weaknesses. Wedding planners are like match makers with your vendors and so worth their cost!'
p3079
aS'***From the Groom*** Our photographer really was amazing. Michelle at Untamed Heart Photography was literally a part of the wedding; I could not have imagined us getting married without her there! The atmosphere that she created, her ability and willingness to get to know us was unparalleled. She rocks and was invaluable to us.\n'

S'The second I opened this wedding my productivity levels plummeted. You see, I found myself lost in a beautiful sea of English Garden inspired blooms from Courtenay Lambert Florals and every little moment captured by BRAUNPhotography sucked me in. Before I knew it, I had been sifting through the gallery for hours. So be forewarned, you will get lost in this beauty!'
p3124
aS'From Courtenay Lambert Florals  The brides vision in planning her wedding was the use of natural elements, while keeping an elegant feel of an English Tea Garden. Our inspiration in the design was  Alice and Wonderland meets English Tea Garden meets Hobbit s Village . Many of the design elements were a mix of inspiration from her Event Designer as well as personal treasures belonging to her family. Use of organic and natural materials, such as moss, stones, wood slices and succulents, were of utmost importance to the bride and groom. The groom wore a tailor maid custom suit and the bridesmaids wore vintage inspired dresses that helped convey the theme of the wedding.'
p3125
aS'From the stunning bride  Joe and I always knew we wanted to get married outside, and the abundance of gorgeous outdoor venues is certainly not lacking in Cincinnati. The French House, nestled in Amberly Village, with its sprawling wildflower fields, intimate garden setting and charming red brick house really spoke to us. You see, Joe grew up in the country, a good old farm boy of sorts, and myself, while not exactly a city girl, I come pretty close. The French House was the perfect venue for uniting the best of these two worlds.'
p3126
aS'I wanted to use soft romantic colors, a tried and true color scheme certainly, used by many brides before me, but I also wanted to capture the laid back earthiness of the outdoors that Joe and I love so much. Juxtaposing more earthy elements like moss, stone and succulents with soft garden roses, ivory lace and blush colored silks was critical in making this balance a reality. It was a casual elegance I was looking for, but something unique, something enchanted. I wanted the style to be textured and spirited. We wanted to strike an intriguing, exciting cord in our style for our guests, and for us! And of course, we wanted to incorporate all kinds of personal touches! The lace overlay for the cake table in particular is a family heirloom, made by my grandmother and great- grandmother for my parent?s wedding forty two years ago. My sister also used this on her cake table and it was finally my turn. This linen demanded something special be placed on it, and I turned to no other than Maureen Thie for this task. Her family owned the original Virginia Bakery and although she no longer was making cakes for private events, my mother s persistent begging payed off. Mo had also made my sisters cake years ago.'
p3127
aS'The ladies got ready at my parent s house. The same place we got ready sixteen years prior when I was the Maid of Honor at my sisters wedding. Now, I could finally honor her as my Matron of Honor, her daughters as Junior Bridesmaids, and her husband as a Groomsman. Really, it was a family affair with my brother and Joe s cousin also in that mix, not to mention a couple of wonderful friends! It was so much fun choosing the attire for everyone. I used BHLDN for the ladies and outfitted the guys in Joseph Abboud. The stylists at BHLDN were fabulous to work with. I sent my bridesmaid s measurements along with the dresses I had chosen and they helped match each dress to everyones body type, helping to ensure that everyone looked their best! To play off the highly textured, whimsical feel of the day I selected different dresses for all my bridesmaids in slightly varying shades of blush. Their dresses were definitely one of my favorite things about the wedding! I went with a classic, vintage feel for the guys incorporating suspenders and bow ties to complete their look.'
p3128
aS'Joe and I decided to do a first look and are so glad we did. Not only did it help to calm some nerves but it was so very special to be able to share that moment and our day with all of our guests via our Same Day Edit video thanks to Studio Z Films. We didn t even tell our wedding party this video was going down. Talk about a tear jerker! Arriving early at the French House also gave us a chance to get a sneak peak into how Courtenay Lambert and her team had transformed this venue into something spectacular. I had met with more florists than I could count, and from the moment I met Courtenay I knew she was the exact one I had been searching for! I followed my heart when it came to assembling our team of venders and I really feel the approach paid off. Even a few last minute changes, albeit a bit stressful, helped to ensure that everything and everyone felt  right . So glad I went with printed flower girl dresses!'
p3129
aS'Our guests were greeted at the French House with a pre ceremony cocktail, paying homage to the time of year with its delicate amber hue of apple cider and champagne, complete with a spiced sugar rim. The Bacon Bar, open during cocktail hour, was also a huge hit, with people feasting on fistfuls of wasabi bacon, chocolate dipped bacon, dijon brown sugar, smoked chili, and cracked pepper bacon. A sign that read  Thank you so much for being here today! We love you more than bacon!!!  adorned the buffet. Renee Schuler of EatWell really hit this one out of the park! Not to mention just about everything else! Luckily, Joe and I had arranged to have a platter of this wonderfully delicious smorgasbord waiting for us upstairs after the ceremony. Best idea ever! In addition to our love of bacon, Joe and I are also craft beer enthusiasts. We served only beers brewed right here in Cincinnati. It was a fun way to share a passion of ours as well as highlight three different local breweries that we love.'
p3130
aS'A drizzle required us to move the ceremony under the tent. A bit disappointing yes, but as the sun emerged immediately after the ceremony, an impromptu family gathering in the garden became one of our favorite memories from the day. Before heading into the tent, Joe and I headed out to the wildflower field to capture some of our first photos as husband and wife. I absolutely adore these shots!'
p3131
aS'Dinner was served family style. It proved to be a great way to engage guests with each other and to enhance the intimacy of the evening, as well as a way to play off the time of year again, a celebration of the harvest! After dinner we showed the Same Day Edit video, cut the cake and took to the dance floor. Soul Pocket, with its funky flavor and three lovely ladies can really take a house down! We danced the night away before piling into the party bus, (another highlight of the evening) and headed downtown to Via Vite on Fountain Square for a night cap. An intimate brunch the next morning at The Metropole was the icing on the cake before heading off to Paradise, thanks to my brother! (Our honeymoon was his wedding gift, the location of which he kept a secret until our Rehearsal Dinner the night before!)'
p3132
aS'October 5th, 2013 was the most wonderful day of my life, complete with one of the biggest rainstorms of the year and a new moon! It was a magical day filled with love, warmth, and passion, family and friendship, and of course, a ton of pretty! \n'

S'Love at first site isn t reserved for just soul mates. No, as this wedding from Kortnee Kate Photogrpahy plainly proves, love at first site can most definitely refer to a wedding. It was the macarons which did me in on this one. Then the preppy, french, chic design kept me in the gallery for hours! See you there?'
p3206
aS'From the beautiful bride  I ve loved Laduree {the Parisian patisserie} and macarons for years. The beautiful Laduree packaging is something I ve collected in my travels to every Laduree I ve ever visited   and taken Richard along with me throughout our 5+ years together. His sweet tooth sure never minds! I adore their feminine colors {light pink & mint green} and delicious macarons. This is where our wedding inspiration began. My mom s friend, graphic designer Kim Jackson of MiTags, designed our wedding logo. We wanted it to be classic and preppy with a twist of French  chic.  We went to France for our honeymoon {and multiple Laduree locations!) so it all came full circle.'
p3207
aS'We used the laurel logo on all of our wedding paper goods: save the dates, wedding invitations, banner at the ceremony, wedding programs, menu cards, macaron favor boxes, sweets table bags, napkins, thank yous, etc. Our wedding favors were pistachio macarons   the boxes were put together by my sister, mom and I on one of our many DIY evenings. The banner that we used at our ceremony was transported to be used above the mantel on the dance floor   a perfect way to use the homemade banner twice!'
p3208
aS'Richard and I love cocktail hour so we wanted to make sure everyone had room to relax & enjoy themselves! That is where the white outdoor couches with pink and white striped pillows with  Madame  and  Monsieur  and our wedding date came into play. We are also primarily beer drinkers so instead of a signature drink we made sure there were enough pink monogrammed koozies to go around.'
p3209
aS'If we aren t drinking beer then we are most likely drinking Veuve {for special occasions, of course!} We celebrated with our bridal party with Veuve after the ceremony {and after the wedding petal toss!} That being said, we decided to have our guests sign Veuve jackets instead of a guest book. The sign said:  To have and to hold and to keep their Veuve cold. Please sign the Veuve jackets for Ash & Rich '
p3210
aS'The sweets table displayed a heirloom silver trophy centerpiece that has been used at every Fehr family wedding. It has been a tradition to use this silver trophy and we were lucky enough to be able to use it at the cocktail hour and on the pink and white sweets table. The sweets take away bags had our logo imprinted with  l amour est doux  meaning love is sweet in French.'
p3211
aS'We wanted to incorporate all of the important women in our lives, especially since neither of us have any living grandmothers. We had photos hanging in the girls bathroom {from French pink and white striped wire ribbon} of our mothers and grandmothers on their wedding day. This was one of the most special parts of the planning process, looking through old wedding albums of our grandparents. We know our grandmothers were with us on our wedding day. We know they were the ones who turned the rainy morning into the most gorgeous evening   75 at the end of July in Cincinnati is not normal. I also wore my grandmothers wedding dress {shortened} at our after party!'
p3212
aS'We worked with Kevin Ford at Ford Ellington Design who helped create the most magical design. I knew I wanted pink flower balls but only in my dreams could I imagine hanging flower balls intertwined with crystal elements to create this chandelier. Kevin took a simple brass chandelier and transformed it into something out of a fairytale. It was more beautiful than anything I could have ever imagined. Kevin was more than a florist, he helped us in every detail, everything from the gorgeous table cloths to the light pink chair cushions (a small detail that I absolutely loved) to the lighting at HPCC, he covered it all. His flowers were over the top and each time I look back at the photos I am more and more in love! I told him I wish I could just live under that chandelier forever.'
p3213
aS'The bridesmaids wore Lela Rose mint green dresses and the groomsmen wore white dinner jackets. We wanted the look to feel classic and simple. Richard and I both had grandfathers who wore white dinner jackets at their weddings so we knew it was meant to be when we were deciding their look.'
p3214
aS'My dress was Justina McCaffrey from Amanda s Hyde Park Bridal   I loved being in that gown from the moment I put it on! It was actually the very first dress I tried on, EVER  if you can believe it! The Badgley Mischka belt was an addition to the dress   it s tiny floral, rhinestone, lace and beaded detail made it an absolute must.'
p3215
aS'The night ended with a send off with tambourines and maracas, we then returned for an after party themed with our college {where we met!} late night food joint, Marvin s. The food was garlic cheeseburgers, fries and beer   Marvin s staples. We continued to dance the night away outdoors with a balloon drop and glow necklaces under a tent with a DJ!'
p3216
aS'From start to finish our wedding was everything we dreamed it would be. It was the best day of our lives and we couldn t have done it without our amazing vendor team!'

S'A Stem Above really nailed classic minimalism with this wedding. Keeping the floral count low but the impact high is not easy, but holy cow, you re about to see it done so, so right. Misty Winter captured this beautiful military wedding and it s the kind that will leave you wishing for more. And when that happens, click here.'
p3252
aS'From the beautiful bride   As a fun, spirited couple, our journey as a couple becoming husband and wife involved new adventures from desert hikes in Arizona, to snowboarding down the Rockies, to cycling centuries around Ohio, to permanent cross country moves. So, it was our inspiration to include the outdoors in our wedding plans with a classic, romantic feel. It was essential to us that our personalities were reflected throughout the day in all the little details: vintage style Chantilly lace of my wedding gown, ceremonial Marine Corps Arch of Swords, cocktail napkins with fun anecdote, beer & wine tastings during cocktail hour, East Coast Swing dance lessons, outdoor dancing with twinkle lights. We wanted to create a unique, warm, inviting and fun day for our guests.'
p3253
aS'For the ceremony, we wanted to be surrounded by beautiful gardens and the outdoors as our dear families and closest friends witnessed the exchange of our vows. We chose the Danada House because it provided the perfect back drop for an outdoor wedding with the ability to create a personal home feel. For cocktail hour, the veranda was flooded with custom wine barrels displaying our wine, cheese, and beer stations featuring our favorite selections. Guests could meander between food stations including bites inspired by our roots in Chicago and new home in California. The bites included mini pizza pops, mini chicago style hot dogs, mini fish tacos, and mini empanadas. Guests were also treated to the chance to take a group East Coast Swing Dance Lesson to prepare for keeping the dance floor hot throughout the night.'
p3254
aS'The modern addition of the Danada House was warmed by arrange a combination of wooden farm tables within a sea of Federal Blue Shantung linen with arrangements and d cor by A Stem Above. Each table included a custom rod iron lanterns, mercury glass candles, and textural floral in a sophisticated palette of monochromatic green to match the bridesmaid s floral. The wall-to-wall windows of the space in combination with the rustic floral and farm tables created a perfect ambiance for guests. The entire Entertaining Company staff was a pleasure to work with, offering each and every guest personal attention. The meal concluded with a phenomenal three-tiered, double chocolate cake prepared by Bent Fork Bakery that we ceremoniously by sword.'
p3255
aS'Our celebration continued outside on the patio deck with dancing under Italian twinkling lights. Our first dance was serenaded by the smooth voice of Amanda Wolff from the Flat Cats and guests continued to dance the night away with lively music putting their dance lessons to use.'
p3256
aS'Upon meeting with our photographer, Misty Winter from Misty Winter Photography, we knew she was a perfect match. Her fun, fresh, and photo journalistic style perfectly captured our day. Equally as important, we genuinely enjoyed the company of Misty. It was as if a dear, close friend was documenting our day instead of a professional stranger. Our wedding planner, Joede Berman created a seamless parade of moments throughout the day that allowed us to enjoy our wedding. It really was THAT easy thanks to all our amazing vendors. We are so thankful for the creativity, professionalism, and quality which created a truly memorable day for us, our families, and friends.\n'

S'I m the first person to admit that I m a tad bit hyperbolic, but when I tell you that this gorgeous Heritage Prairie Farm wedding is heartwarming, it s a serious understatement.  Because beyond all of the crazy beautiful details and the cozy farm setting (I want) is a story of two darling sweethearts and a tribute to a grandmother you just can t miss.  See it all captured by Cassandra Eldridge right here.'
p3307
aS'From the Bride  When Michael and I dreamed of our wedding day as we planned, we never in a million years would have guessed that everything would turn out EXACTLY as it looked in our heads. I stumbled upon Heritage Prairie Farm with my parents on a cold, gloomy New Year s Eve and we fell in love with the place instantly, I knew I didn t need to see any other venues and needed to show Michael immediately. It captured everything we had talked about wanting in a wedding venue   the down-home, Midwest hospitality that we love about living in Chicago (where Michael was born and raised) and the quaint, rustic feel of my home in Philadelphia.'
p3308
aS'We love to entertain and are always throwing gatherings and cooking dinner for friends and family, and we wanted our wedding to feel like you stepped into our own backyard for an intimate dinner party. It was exactly how the night turned out. The weather was exactly what we pictured at 68 degrees and impossibly sunny, the music was all the Motown and friend favorites we d hinted for the DJ s to play, and the food was better than most of the five star restaurants I ve visited.'
p3309
aS'Working with the world s BEST vendors, we were able to bring this vision of a cozy night in to our outdoor venue. We used the farm s claim to fame as a bee/honey farm as our inspiration and married the symbol with our love of all things quaint for a french country feel. The color schemes we used of golds, pale yellows and creams truly captured the acres of wheat and corn, and the golden glow of Fall. Anywhere we could find a bee   we did it! Beeswax candle gifts, bee printed burlap runners, invitations, gift tags, you name it!'
p3310
aS'We wanted our day to feel as unique as we are. Having being raised Jewish, and Michael raised Catholic, we aimed to have a ceremony that pleased everyone and still have a special, ceremonial touch to it. The words of the Hand Fasting ceremony really resonated with us as well as it s ancient tradition, so our officiant quickly learned all the words to recite. All of my jewelry came from my paternal grandmother who passed down some vintage jewelry to me when my sister got married, and I have been dying to wear it finally! Together with my girlfriends, Mike s mom and sisters, and my mother and sister, we created lots of DIY projects on Friday nights where I provided wine and snacks as a  thank you  for being amazing gift.'
p3311
aS'The day had so much meaning for us on so many levels. My grandmother turned 88 that same day, and flew all the way over from Belfast, Northern Ireland to celebrate with us. Instead of having a traditional cake for ourselves, we went with doughnut holes so we could save the cake for something much more important   celebrating her birthday. She was so overcome with happiness (and surprise!) when we wheeled out the two tier cake with buttercream and cannoli filling just for her. We had everyone sing to her and she blew out the candles. Having her and Mike s grandmother there was the world to us. So, while the day was a celebration of our love, it was also really a party to thank our incredible family and the best friends on Earth for everything they have done for us. We would be nothing without them and the day couldn t have existed without them by our side.'

S'This bride has some serious style.  I mean, one look at the amazing Joanna August clad bridesmaids and it s pretty plain to see (they are lovely).  And her beautiful Chicago Botanic Garden wedding?  Well, it s just as gorgeous as you would think it would be with stunning blooms from Virginia Wolff, soft gold and blush hues and all sorts of love-filled moments captured by David Lai.  See it all here.'
p3355
aS'From the Bride  After one heck of a surprise during a vacation to Napa Valley, I found myself engaged to the man of my dreams and planning the most important event of my life. As a public relations professional, planning an event was my forte, but I ve never planned a wedding before. I didn t have a scrapbook started from my childhood, but thank goodness for Pinterest! When you throw events for a living, there s a lot of pressure to blow people away. During the planning process, there were two things that were important to me: the venue and the dress.'
p3356
aS'My soon-to-be-groom, Wes Moran, and I (Janice Yu) must have visited 10+ venues before discovering the Chicago Botanic Garden. From the moment we arrived at the site, I knew this was where we had to get marry. It also helped that there was a wedding that night so we saw how beautiful it could be. It was outdoor and there were flowers everywhere (built-in decor!). The location was beautiful already with minimal decor needed. We found our wedding venue!'
p3357
aS'Wes and I met at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign almost seven years ago, and have been together ever since.'
p3358
aS'We were married at dusk on Aug. 30, 2013 at the Chicago Botanic Garden, with the sun setting as we ate, drank and danced. The ceremony took place in the garden pavilion next to a pond, and the reception followed in a tent overlooking the pond. It had rained earlier in the day, and when the couple exchanged vows, lightning joined the party as an unexpected guest.'
p3359
aS'One of our close friends officiated the wedding, which made the ceremony extra special. I went with a rustic glam theme, making use of the natural blush and cream colors found in the garden, which is located in Glencoe. Gold accents, including the ribbon on the cake and the centerpiece vases, completed the look.'
p3360
aS'At the reception, his and hers cocktails   a Manhattan and a Moscow Mule, respectively   were served. Freshly made chocolate macaroons from a local restaurant, Storefront Company, were given as favors. We danced to Michael Bubl  s  Everything. '
p3361
aS'For the guestbook, we had family and friends take Polaroid photos and leave notes with them. We also encouraged guests to share photos via their special wedding hashtag on Instagram. About 100 photos were tagged.'
p3362
aS'After the wedding, we went on a Mediterranean cruise for our honeymoon. Both foodies, Wes and I loved trying different restaurants in Greece and Italy, and indulged in plenty of fresh pasta and Italian wine.'

aS'From the Bride  The moment when I began getting ready with my bridesmaids and my mom, I really began to feel like a bride. As my mom and bridesmaids helped me put on my dress and veil, I was filled with excitement and joy and wanted to soak in every moment from that day. We got ready in a beautiful room in the farmhouse with a canopy bed and delicate little details that added sweet touches to the beauty of the day. I will never forget the moments when my dad and my nana came in to the room to see me, both with tears in their eyes. I know that they both had dreamt of this day for a long time and I was so thankful to be able to share in the joy of this day with them. Right before the ceremony, my mom, bridesmaids, and a good friend prayed for me. Tears fell down my face as I listened to each person pray and was reminded of God s faithfulness and goodness in bringing Ken into my life.'

aS'One of my favorite memories from getting ready was when Ken and the groomsmen arrived at the farm and they began walking around the property. Unbeknownst to them, we were right inside the house getting ready and every time they would walk by our windows we would duck down so that they couldn t see us. I playfully asked one of my flower girls, Sophie, to keep watch for me and she let me know each time Ken was  trying to peek .'
p3449
aS'As I waited at the top of the hill before I walked down the aisle, so many thoughts were going through my head. This was a day that I had waited and prayed for for many years and now here I was, about to walk down the aisle to marry the man God had been preparing for me. I didn t feel nervous in that moment, just sheer joy and excitement. I loved sharing that moment with my dad, laughing and joking   making sure he remember his line for the ceremony   and being filled with gratitude for my father who has loved me so well and helped shaped me into the woman I ve become.'
p3450
aS'Walking down the long  aisle  from the top of the hill towards Ken is a moment that will always be etched in my mind. I loved hearing the music play as I walked down the aisle and seeing so many family and friends gathered together from near and far to celebrate this day with us. Ken and I did not see each other before the ceremony, so that first moment when we saw each other as bride and groom was so special. The ceremony was very meaningful for both of us and we could tangibly feel the love and joy of the Lord in our presence. My favorite moment was after communion when Ken s brother was singing as Ken and I prayed and held each other close. I remember feeling the warmth of the sun on my face and such delight in that moment, knowing that I was married to my best friend.'
p3451
aS'The entire day was amazing, it s so hard to pick a favorite memory. One that stands out in my mind is watching the harvest moon rise together with Ken. We snuck away from the tent for a few moments to pause and savor the day. As we stood outside in the dark and Ken held me close, we beheld God s amazing glory unfolding before our eyes. We knew there was going to be a full moon on our wedding night, but we could have never imagined that a radiant orange moon would be painted across the sky that night and reflected beautifully off the river below us. It was another amazing gift from God on our wedding day.'
p3452
aS'My biggest advice to future brides is to trust that no matter what happens during the planning, that in the end, things will turn out wonderfully. We had multiple unexpected  glitches  during our planning process that were frustrating and disappointing at the time, but in the end our wedding day turned out more perfectly than I could have planned or imagined. I know that God was in control of it all and His ways are perfect.\n'

aS'From Megan Saul I am sharing with you today this beautiful, summer Chicago wedding. Danielle and Jason s wedding took place just outside Chicago, Illinois at Emerson Creek Pottery Barn and Tearoom. Their wedding was filled with rustic, vintage and chic DIY decor. Light colors mixed with beautiful peach roses and succulents. Danielle and Jason both handmade and designed everything for their wedding from their invitations to all their favors. The sweets table was to die for and one of the spectacular beauties I have ever laid eyes on. Their wedding felt like a fairy tale with a modern twist. Danielle s dress was astounding with lace and ruffle detail. Danielle being Italian and Jason, Jewish their wedding ceremony held both Jewish and Catholic traditions and the same for their reception. Man, can they throw a party.\n'

S'Inspired by the rich beauty of the ol  Emerald Isle, this Tir Na Nog Estate wedding is what St. Paddy s celebration (SMP style) is all about. And while tragedy struck the bride s family just days before the wedding, the result was a love that prevailed even stronger. Read on for the whole story and don t miss the gallery of Brosnan Photographic s captures plus Le Cape Weddings s film sitting pretty down below.'
p3535
aS'From Brosnan Photographic  This was a dream wedding to photograph for me as it was a personal one. Christiana was my childhood best friend. We grew up with our houses back to back from each other. We grew apart when my family moved houses when we were around 10 years old. Years later we reconnected through Facebook and after 17 years we finally met again when Christiana asked me to be her wedding photographer. Fate stepped in again as I found out they were planning an Ireland inspired wedding and I just happen to currently live in Ireland but would be home in Chicago when they were getting married.'
p3536
aS'From the Bride  Like so many other brides, I had a strong sense of what I wanted in our big day and I wanted it to be our Best Day Ever. This phrase took on a life of its own and became part of all of our wedding stationery and our website name and even the sign we posted at the entrance to the estate so our guests could find us. It was also important to me to highlight our heritage, as we both have Irish ancestry and were getting married at an Irish country estate.'
p3537
aS'Family and dear friends came to play a very big role in our week leading up to the wedding. My paternal grandmother, with whom I was very close, collapsed the weekend before our wedding and ended up in a coma in the hospital. She passed away early Wednesday morning just days before our Saturday wedding. What could have been a total tragedy and loss ended up strengthening our bonds with each other and those we hold most dear. Everyone fought to give us the Best Day Ever in spite of the loss and the night-before wind storm that nearly collapsed the rental tent. Even my father, who was the most devastated of all, told me that he was  determined to have as much fun as possible,  and ended up dancing shirtless with my groom until the end of the evening.'
p3538
aS'I am so thankful that I booked Christina s photography services, Le Cape s amazing videography skills, and the fabulous vendors who rallied to help us with grace and compassion. We were blessed with a wonderfully emotional and meaningful day from start to finish surrounded by everyone we love most in the world. I would advise all brides to hire the vendors you feel best about in your heart and hire a day-of coordinator if your venue doesn t provide one! Those are the people who will have your back when disaster strikes and help you pull off a wedding that leaves your guests stunned that anything terrible had even happened!\n'

S'High school best friends who lost touch and found each other again the day their team won the world series. It s the makings of a particularly cute rom-com and the finale would most definitely be this casual chic wedding from D Squared Designs!'
p3569
aS'From the stunning bride  We actually met in 2003, during my freshman year and Chad s sophomore year of high school. We quickly became the best of friends and were involved in a lot of school activities together. Unfortunately, we lost touch during our college years. But, we were reunited after the 2011, final World Series game, while celebrating our beloved St. Louis Cardinals  victory. Chad and I literally ran into each other. Call it fate or a God thing. But, from that moment on, we were practically inseparable.'
p3570
aS'Chad was quite the traveler and I was not too surprised when he suggested taking a cruise  in a couple of weeks . We left for our cruise on Friday February 15th. Looking back now, I realize he had dropped a HUGE hint on Valentine s Day by giving me two wife cards. I just thought he was being super cute like always! Day 2 of our cruise, we arrived at the Isle of Rotan, Honduras. We went snorkeling around a 7 acre private island. After snorkeling, Chad insisted we take a walk around the island and we stopped at a place with this amazing view! Chad put his arms around me and told me how much he loved me. When I turned around to give him a hug, he went down on one knee and with the ring in his hand, he asked me to marry him. I pulled him off of his knee, wrapped my arms around him, and with many happy tears said YES!'
p3571
aS'Chad and I did not want a long engagement, and we both wanted an outside ceremony at our favorite winery, Cedar Lake Cellars. We decided on a fall wedding. The next order of business was my dress, which was more special than I ever imagined! And I did not choose anything to traditional. My dress was a beautiful shade of buff which we  redesigned . This requires very skilled seamstresses! We planned a 400 guest wedding, with 19 of our closest friends and family members as attendants, in just 7 months! We really wanted our wedding to represent both of us. The theme became romantic, rustic and chic, with a touch of vintage, which basically means  all of our favorite things . The romance and chic represented me, and the rustic represented Chad. We also chose colors that we both already loved, shades of white and ivory, teal blue, and brown. These are the same colors we used to decorate our home. Our colors, style, and theme were represented in every detail of the wedding, from our  paper products  (save the dates and invitations) to our cake table, brides  maids  dresses and babies  breath bouquets! Our beautiful, buttercream rose covered cake sat on a tree stump (Chad), and the table was draped in lace (me). Even during cocktail hour, our favorite  appetizers  were represented  IMOS pizza and White Castles (Chad s favorites) were brought in, and some of my favorite vegetarian foods, vegetables, assorted flavors of hummus, cheeses, crackers, and grapes were served, of course on big, old vintage doors, wine barrels and wooden crates.'
p3572
aS'The personal touches For our center pieces, we wanted babies  breath topiaries, wine bottles, wood, and candles. My mother spray painted 50 wine bottles a buttery shade of ivory and stenciled each with teal blue birds and branches. She made sure to  age  them to give them that vintage touch. Ivory painted frames held everything from chalkboard menus to black and white wedding photos of our family, from parents to  great-great  grandparents and were placed throughout for all to see. My very creative father, constructed, stained and painted beautiful rustic wooden signs, from old wooden pallets, with our favorite love quotes and Bible verses, which were placed about for our guests to read. They turned out amazing! Chad s aunt made us a rustic clock from a large, wooden, spool which we displayed during the ceremony and celebration.  Time to Get Married  was painted on the clock face. We now have it displayed in our home. We were SO blessed to be able to have sweet, personal touches displayed all throughout our wedding venue!'
p3573
aS'We topped off our  romantic, rustic, chic, with a touch of vintage  themed wedding with candles, tree stumps & discs and baby s breath EVERYWHERE! I was lucky enough to have an abundant supply of free wood as my husband s family owns a tree service and environmental service company. And let me tell you, I took full advantage of it!'
p3574
aS'I can honestly say that for us, we had the most perfect day and wedding celebration! It took a lot of planning and crafting, but it was all absolutely worth it! And some of my absolute favorite moments of our special day, were the things we did not plan, like the most gorgeous  sky blue pink  sunset I have ever seen, the ring around the moon, and the white swans that decided to swim in the pond during our celebration.'
p3575
aS'My advice to any bride, is to plan a wedding that truly represents both she and her fianc , and to enjoy and cherish every moment during this wonderful time in their lives  because it is truly wonderful!'
p3576
aS'Our wedding was truly a labor love! I cannot thank my amazing parents, family, and friends enough for everything they did to help us have the most perfect wedding day! And, I cannot thank God enough for letting me meet and marry the love of my life and my best friend! I am truly blessed!\n'

S'Do you ever come across a wedding that is so perfect you feel like you might just need a little pinch to prove it? It s layers of beautiful paper from Paperista upon layers of scrumptious details from Park Place Weddings & Events upon layers of love and happiness, and it s beautifully captured by the talented Liz Banfield. There s even a delish cake from Cocoa & Fig on top. In case you haven t caught on, I m talking about this perfect soiree.'
p3645
aS'From the photographer  Marion and David s love story began during Marion s first days as a freshman at Brown University. David, an upperclassman and the older brother of Marion s best friend, gallantly offered to  show her around.  Soon a romance bloomed. The couple became engaged years later when David proposed at home by hanging a diamond engagement ring on their Christmas tree.'
p3646
aS'Marion and her planner Stephanie Johnson of Park Place Planning set out to create a day that would suit Marion s classic and timeless style. Though the couple resides in Florida, Marion knew from the beginning that she wanted to her wedding to take place in her home state of Minnesota, with a reception at the picturesque Woodhill Country Club where she spent the carefree summers of her childhood. The club s rolling hills provided an ideal backdrop for the cocktail hour as well as views from the upper deck during the dinner and dance.'
p3647
aS'Since Marion and David were going to have many out of town guests, they prioritized showing everyone all the best that Minnesota has to offer. Upon arriving at the hotel, each guest received a thoughtful, comprehensive welcome box created by Park Place Planning. The box included colorful wayfarer-style sunglasses, mini Chandon champagne bottles, custom stir sticks, a crucial  recovery kit,  along with trail mix snacks and bottled water. The entire weekend was filled with parties so that everyone had multiple opportunities visit with the bride and groom. Since the wedding was happening during the Fourth of July week, they started off the festivities with a welcome party boat cruise around Lake Minnetonka, dining on ribs and chicken while watching the holiday fireworks over the water. The next night, they hosted their guests at a groom s dinner at the historic Minneapolis Club. And after the wedding reception, everyone was invited to keep the party going after hours.'
p3648
aS'The wedding day began at the spacious and elegant Minneapolis bridal salon, L Atelier Bridal Couture. Taking advantage of their  White Glove Service,  Marion and her ladies enjoyed a luxurious morning of pampering at this picture-perfect  getting ready  location. They spent the morning in the sun-lit space having hair done by Jon Charles Salon and makeup by Jett Makeup. Marion gifted her bridal party with matching robes from Plum Pretty Sugar for that extra touch of stylish comfort. The girls sipped Veuve Cliquot mimosas and noshed on gourmet snacks while getting ready. Marion was dressed in her classically elegant Vera Wang Luxe  Esther  gown from L Atelier Bridal Couture. Marion and the ladies were personally styled by the owner, Amanda Kautt, before they were all whisked away to the church.'
p3649
aS'Following a traditional service, the wedding guests were led out of the church by a traditional bagpiper (honoring Marion s Scottish heritage) and lined the majestic front stairs of St. Mark s Cathedral for a celebratory send off as the just-married couple made their way to the 1956 Bentley S-1. The formal service now over, Marion transformed her dress by removing the lace jacket overlay which gave her a simple strapless silhouette suitable for dozens of congratulatory hugs (and the 90+ degree July temps!).'
p3650
aS'When it came to wedding details, Marion and David wanted to combine traditional wedding elements with thoughtful, personal details. The couple worked with Paperista owner Antoinette Ramos who designed a classic engraved gold monogram that tied together all the paper goods. Each engraved invitation included this stunning monogram and was personalized with a hand-calligraphed die-cut card and wrapped with a silk dupioni ribbon. The place cards echoed this design, each hand-calligraphed place card wrapping around a menu with gold engraved lettering. For the desert, Marion and David worked closely with Cocoa & Fig s owner Laurie Pyle to design a five-tier wedding cake adorned with a cascade of fresh flowers and accented with  lace  frosting detail inspired by Marion s gown.'
p3651
aS'Guests signed in with a Velvet Raptor guest book decorated with the couple s monogram. The dining tables were punctuated by lush, classically white and pale pink tone centerpieces created by Jackie Just of Just Bloomed. Low arrangements of garden roses, hydrangea, and luscious peonies were balanced against stunning high floral pieces anchored on a dramatic crystal candelabras.'
p3652
aS'Following dinner and toasts the couple literally danced the night away, treating guests to an unforgettable musical performance from the Utah band Party Crashers complete with a Michael Jackson impersonator. The dance floor was still\n completely full when it was time to send off the newlyweds. Guests lined up with sparklers, fitting for the 4th of July holiday, to light the way as Marion and David hopped on transportation leading to their after party hosted at Graves 601 Cosmos bar.'

S'This one checks all my boxes. Snow, Northern Michigan, a rustic yet completely chic design from Sincerely, Ginger Weddings & Events. All the fixings for the inspiration shoot that will top all others, at least in my humble opinion. I ll let you be the judge though, with this stunning gallery, captured by Weber Photography.'
p3692
aS'From the stylist  With unbeatable scenery, friendly wedding professionals and picture perfect spots for weddings sprinkled all along Lake Michigan, Northern Michigan is an obvious spot for summer destination weddings. When Cory Weber (of Weber Photography) and I met and started talking about the details of our shoot, it was really important to us that we emphasize what gorgeous winters we have here! Snow Moon Ranch was an idyllic venue to bring our vision of a cozy winter wedding to life. Luckily we had a fresh snow the day before.'
p3693
aS'When designing the table and florals, I knew I wanted to stick with a color scheme of neutral tones and winter whites. To add a little femininity to the rustic venue, I added blush garden roses and pink alstroemeria. We took advantage of the incredible details Snow Moon Ranch already had, and pulled inspiration from the rolling fences, stunning views, and small potted trees that were tucked inside the barn for warmth.'
p3694
aS'Our incredible bridal model, Katie, wore a show-stopping Casablanca gown with layers upon layers of tulle, and delicate beading on the bodice. We went with a classic look for our Groom, with a black suit and a blush pink and wax flower boutonni re.'
p3695
aS'For the dessert bar, Kenna from Everything Gal put together an astonishing variety of desserts. She brought in beautiful textures, including a fair isle inspired buttercream cake! The richness of the dessert table was perfect for a winter wedding.'
p3696
aS'Gatherings Vintage Rentals provided the elegant mixed table settings, which I chose to adorn with a simple tied ribbon and a touch of greenery. The linens were from my private collection, and included a mix of floor length white linens in various textures. I used a tulle tablecloth as a delicate runner to balance the heaviness of the natural white crystal candle holders.'

S'This is why I love Chicago weddings.  One minute we re partying it up with an adorable duo in a posh ballroom and the next we re basking in some nautical-style pretty at the Columbia Yacht Club.  This is a city that knows how to throw an awesome wedding.  And when it all comes together in a drop-dead gorgeous gallery captured by Rada Portzer?  Amazing.  See it all here.'
p3736
aS'From the Bride  Jesse grew up sailing at the Columbia Yacht Club and from the moment we chose this venue for our special day, we knew it would serve as a romantic and unique location to celebrate our marriage.'
p3737
aS'We wanted the decor to remain simple, classic and elegant. The Chicago skyline and harbor views provided such a beautiful backdrop, we didn t need much more. HMR Designs did an incredible job with the flowers and table decor. Two if By Sea Studios (a close friend) created all the printed material. The cake and individual desserts came from a local bakery from my hometown. 1982 Bordeaux from my father s wine collection was served at dinner. Finally, the ceremony was officiated by one of my husband s close friends and we prepared our own vows. All of these details helped create an intimate and personal celebration which is exactly what we wanted to share with our family and closest friends.'
p3738
aS'And the dinner/party was a blast! In keeping with the classy, Chicago theme, we hired a big band orchestra (thanks Old Town School of Folk) and danced to classics like Etta James and Frank Sinatra. Truly the best day of our lives.'

S'For the life of me, I can not understand why more destination weddings are not held on Lake Michigan. My only thought is that people have no idea how absolutely stunning Michigan can be, but we re about to remedy that today. Betsi Ewing Studio captured Charlevoix s beauty, and thanks to this wedding it was at it s prettiest this day in May. Are you ready for the gallery?'
p3792
aS'From the gorgeous bride  Leland and I should have met in high school since both his best friend and mine dated, but somehow fate left it so that we did not meet till later in life. Post high school we both left Michigan, Leland to Montana and myself, well  several places. A few years ago we each came back to our old hometown and to our old hole in the wall bar where we finally crossed paths. We dated for a few months before we went to his family s summer home in Charlevoix. There in Charlevoix watching the sunset on Lake Michigan was the first time he said  I love you . Six months later we moved to Pennsylvania and two years later he proposed.'
p3793
aS'Due to the sentimental reasons and the charm of Charlevoix, it seemed the obvious choice. We knew we wanted to keep things beautifully simple. Our ceremony was on the sail docks followed by cocktail hour on the upper lawn. After cocktails we walked to the Belvedere club s reception area where we dined on sliders and French fries.'
p3794
aS'My one suggestion to any bride would be to decide what is most important to you and go with it. Remember the day is yours and you will not get a second go at it. Make yourselves (you and your husband to be!) happy. Things may go awry, but in the end you marry the one you love and that is what it is all about.\n'

aS'From Lisa Dolan Photography Jenna and John are an amazing and gorgeous couple, who planned an equally gorgeous wedding for Labor Day weekend at the Gardens at Malmaison in St. Albans, Missouri. On September 1st, one of the hotter day in St. Louis, 95 degress to be exact, Jenna and John wed. The wedding was absolute perfection   down to every last detail! Jenna chose a bouquet of Peonies and hydrangeas in pink and white, which added a pop of color and brightness to the navy bridesmaids dresses. The wedding ceremony took place in the Gardens underneath large shade trees. The reception immediately followed the ceremony under a nearby tent. The couple chose pink and white flowers in white vases to accent sparkly table numbers. Instead of a traditional cake, the couple opted to include a pie bar with varying types of pies for guests to enjoy.\n'

S'Heather Cook Elliott Photography, cliffs overlooking Lake Michigan, a stunning couple in black tie  buckle up loves because you re about to be blown away by way of a ridiculously beautiful, straight to the top of the favorites list, wedding. Are you ready?'
p3873
aS'From the photographer  Sarah & Ryan were married on a blustery blue sky day in Kohler, Wisconsin where the land ends in craggy bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan. A little piece of Ireland sits on that bluff at Whistling Straits, a world class golf course and a world class wedding destination where Sarah & Ryan chose to say I Do under the weathered wood trellis of the Irish Barn. Sarah & Ryan are a fascinating mixture of elegance and comfort, fancy and homey, gorgeous and cute, sexy and sweet. And that is exactly how their wedding day was. Stunning elegance was evident everywhere: Ryan cut a dashing figure in his Vera Wang slim cut suit and Sarah stopped hearts with side swept hair and a gown to die for. Intricately styled centerpieces overflowed with candlelight, flowers, pearls and mercury glass while bridesmaids danced and toasted in statement dresses with bold textured patterns. And there was the comfy, homey side to everything they designed: Boho chic frames and lanterns framed pictures of Sarah & Ryan and those they loved and Sarah carried a delicate bouquet composed ENTIRELY of gardenias. I adore the sleek, almost James Bond like no bout look that Ryan sported and how Sarah had the guts to bring the glam pairing a full tulle skirted dress with a stone barn wedding. During their ceremony they sealed a bottle of wine and love letters to one another in a custom wood wine caddy for opening on a future anniversary and they watched the sunset from the grassy hills of the course, simply happy to be together as husband and wife.'

aS'We were there to capture all the love, laughter and gorgeousness and if you ask me true love looks great on them both.\n'

S'A crazy thing happens when gold and pink hues combine: I lose all ability to speak.  And if you knew my gabbing abilities first hand, trust me, you d know that s kind of a big thing.  Add in a gorgeous lakeside location and a bride and groom who know everything about throwing a pretty party and, well  happy Friday, lovelies.  See it all captured by Kai Heeringa right here.'
p3931
aS'From the Bride  We are super proud and so very excited to share our Michigan lakeside wedding with you. Not many people realize the true beauty (and fun) that is Northern Michigan. From the day we got engaged we wanted to host a weekend getaway that encompassed the true spirit of  Up North.  Going  Up North  was something I had done majority of weekends since I was a child, and throughout dating, my husband couldn t help but fall in love with the lifestyle as well. Celebrating great times with great friends, weekends were spent on the boat, in the woods, or lakeside by the campfire, or just inside enjoying each others  company. We were so delighted to find The Inn at Bay Harbor and the Bay Harbor Golf Club to host our event on August 3, 2013.'
p3932
aS'The timeless elegance feel of Bay Harbor set the tone for the wedding, and the views of Lake Michigan and the beautiful sunsets did nothing but compliment the look and feel we were going for. We wanted every element to be custom for not only us a couple, but our guests as well. As if they were also enjoying their own special weekend away up north. Starting with the custom monograms on the invites & paper products, the sequin covered dessert table with all our favorite treats, to the individually chosen bridesmaid dresses and jewelry, right down to the hand-written envelopes and place cards, it was all about the details. We wanted everyone to be comfortable and leave the event just as happy as we were.'
p3933
aS'Lucky enough for us (and with lots of help from the Mother of the Bride) we were able to find a variety of vendors across the country that were able to take our visions (aka the brides random scribbly drawings) and make them a reality. It was amazing how they were all able to take the various pieces or projects and bring them full circle into one final perfect package. We both loved seeing the delight of our guests as they snapped pictures on the balcony in the sunset, pocketing their place cards, or leaving little mementos in our personalized guest book.'
p3934
aS'The weekend was spent with cocktails by the lake, relaxing by the pool, shopping downtown, basking in the sun, topped off with a lake lawn ceremony, pictures on the boat, and ended with dancing the night away to the best band with all our favorite people. The weekend was all we wanted and so much more.'

S'Fall weddings are my favorite. Especially when those affairs are tucked inside a beautiful rustic venue like Cherry Basket Farm. It s just as you would imagine; rolling hills, colorful leaves, cozy blankets and the yummiest dinner feast. That, plus an adorable pup named Otis. Head to the gallery for even more as seen through the lens of Michelle March and be sure to hit play on the film from Lonetree Productions.'
p4004
aS'From the Bride  Growing up in Michigan, Donovan and I have always looked forward to Fall. It s the time of year when we get to go to the apple orchard for fresh cider & donuts, take nice long drives to explore the countryside and cozy up in plaid throws! '
p4005
aS'After searching the midwest for the perfect venue we stumbled upon Cherry Basket farm in Omena, MI (only five hours North from our hometown). We, including our sheepdog, Otis, fell in love with every aspect of the venue at first sight. We wanted our guests to get an entire  fall weekend  experience during our wedding weekend. Driving to the venue you couldn t help but get butterflies in your stomach while passing rolling green hills, birch trees with falling yellow leaves & pops of orange & vibrant reds. '
p4006
aS'To get to the ceremony site you walked down a hill, through a field and sat down on a hay bale with a vintage throw to keep warm. There were cups of cider & donuts for refreshments & a copy of  our story  which acted as the programs. In our story we included details of personal adventures from our 9 year relationship and travels around the world together.  '
p4007
aS'Saying our vows was my favorite memory from our wedding (the bridesmaids and I were all barefoot). It was so magical looking around at the beautiful farm, seeing 70 of our closest friends & family and hearing the bagpipes in the distance. I noticed Donovan was wearing the tie clip I bought him after our engagement with the latitude & longitude of where we got engaged (Rock Creek, Montana); I touched it & he smiled so big  I could see everything from our relationship rush through both of our heads at the same time. Such a surreal moment. '
p4008
aS'Shockingly one of the first things we crossed off our list was finalizing the menu. Food was a very important detail to us. We had all of our favorites and everything was local/farm to table. Starting with the most delicious pumpkin soup of all time! '
p4009
aS'Growing up with a love of old things & owning a vintage shop, picking a favorite decade is very challenging for me. I love so many different things about every era and my personal style is very eclectic. It s very common to find me wearing a blouse from the 20s with a sweater from the 70s and a modern skirt. So I wanted incorporate the 20s-70s in our wedding details. I found my 1930s wedding dress at one of my favorite vintage shops, Dear Golden. From the moment I tried it on and the peachy colored lace hit every spot just right, I knew it was the one! I didn t have to have a single alteration made which is really really rare because I m the alteration queen, everything in my personal closet has little tweaks. My reception dress was the complete opposite of my ceremony dress, It s from the 50s and a super fun little party dress  it was made to dance and twirl! Another one of my favorite details was the bridesmaids dresses, I assigned each of them with a decade that suited them best starting with the 20s-70s and they got to pick they re ivory dresses! It was such a fun process, all the bridesmaids were really happy with their dresses and can wear them again! I styled them with the same shoes and accessories (Swedish Hasbeens and custom gold twig bracelets from Dallas Maynard).\n'

S'I dare you to take one look at this glorious Heritage Prairie Farm affair and NOT fall head over heels in love.  Go on, I dare you.  Because this beautiful day captured by Two Birds Photography?  It s the kind of day that seamlessly merges rustic details with elegant stylings and allllll sorts of pretty.  See every last gorgeous moment right here, right now in the full gallery.'
p4059
aS'From Two Birds Photography  This was one of those weddings, where after I got home from a long day on my feet, I sat down and thought:  I could shoot a hundred weddings in a row, if they were all like this one. '
p4060
aS'Simply put, Karis and Dirk had my idea of a perfect wedding. It was laid-back, beautiful, charming and truly spoke to who they were as a couple.'
p4061
aS'Heritage Prairie Farms in Elburn, IL was the perfect setting for their day. They had a beautiful garden ceremony where the hanging vases of brightly colored flowers were the perfect backdrop for their sweet vows. Their tented reception was filled with laughter and love, and their food was amazing! We loved their favors of organic honey, and their adorable name cards held with little magnetic animals. Closing the evening with marshmallows over a bonfire was, in my book, just right.'
p4062
aS'From the Bride  I picked my florist, Marla, because she was highly recommended by the venue and she really  got  the vibe of what we were looking for   more rustic and casual. She was also very easy to work with and as the owner of her own business really gave everything a very personal touch.'
p4063
aS' Toast and Jam has the best reputation of any DJ company I found in Chicago. I loved their list of songs they won t play. That s when I knew we would be music soul mates. I wanted someone who would make sure all of our guests were having fun, not just someone who would play mine and the groom s or their own personal faves. Sarah also played the ceremony music and helped us figure out the order of the evening s events and how things would flow. Everything just happened seamlessly because of her, but not because she was obnoxiously cutting in and making announcements every 10 minutes. She just knew how to run a party!'
p4064
aS'Hair and makeup were by Montage Salon and Spa in Geneva. They did my hair and makeup and my bridesmaids  hair. I chose them because they were local, highly recommended and would come out to the farm.'
p4065
aS'Instead of cake, we had pies from Hoosier Mama Pie Company in Chicago. We are both big pie fans and Hoosier Mama was already a favorite place of mine. They were so easy to work with and we had a lot of fun tasting different pies   it was hard to choose! Both of us come from families of pie lovers, so this was just a natural choice.'
p4066
aS'My friend Adam Randall played  Naked as We Came  by Iron and Wine for the ceremony music. Adam has been one of my best friends since I was 13, and he flew up from Florida to be there, so this was a special moment for me. '
p4067
aS'Catering and Alcohol were by the venue, Heritage Prairie Farm. This venue was so perfect for us and our families. It was beautiful and natural and relaxing. They designed a menu based on our favorite foods and our heritage. We both wanted Southern food to be part of the day. We picked the farm because we loved the outdoor setting and the fact that they did pretty much everything   catering, alcohol, planning, linens, decor, etc. This ended up being the best decision we made. Our guests loved the venue and really could relax and enjoy themselves. And the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.'
p4068
aS'Photographer was Two Birds, of course.  I initially found Jake by reading the glowing reviews online. When I met with him in person I knew he would be a great fit. He was very easy to talk to and such a genuine person. I have been to weddings where the photographers are yelling at people or disrupting guests to get a good shot, but his approach was much more personal and observant. The wedding party and family members really liked working with him.'
p4069
aS'Day of coordinator was Laura Naab, a friend and the sister of one of my bridesmaids. She took care of things on that day that I didn t even know were going awry!'
p4070
aS'Day of stationery (programs, menus, etc.) we did ourselves using an inexpensive publishing software plus multiple trips to Paper Source and Kinkos.'
p4071
aS'Our photobooth was DIY   we had paper props, a backdrop, and a polaroid and film. People got really creative as the night went on, and we loved looking at these later!'
p4072
aS'Best moment of the day: After the ceremony was over, we loved going out to the cocktail hour and seeing all of these people we love, from different parts of our lives, meeting each other and having fun. We wanted our guests to have fun more than anything, and to realize how special they were to us. I had printed and hung special photos of many of our guests (old photos of relatives, other friends  weddings, etc.) and watching people laugh and smile as they looked at them was wonderful.'
p4073
aS'Advice to other couples: Two pieces of advice, really  1) make it personal   I ll never regret the extra time going through old photo albums, talking about songs we love, personalizing the menu. 2) don t be afraid to ditch a project!   No one is going to remember whether your escort cards looked like something from Pinterest, but they WILL remember if you lose your sanity or become a craftzilla because you ve taken on too much.'

S'To be totally honest, I was never the girl who could pull of that cool billowing, boho sort of look. Preppy and polished is much more my style, but that doesn t mean I don t long to live vicariously through those who can. And this Minnesota bride? Well, she s sort of my hero. With a wedding that embodies all my boho dreams brought to life, I could spend forever in Paper Antler s photos right over here. '
p4111
aS'From the Bride  We wanted our wedding to be a celebration that reflected the joy we find in nature and creativity. For these reasons, we chose a whimsical venue in the woods of Juliane James Place. Everything felt incredibly personal, from the handmade dinnerware to the homemade desserts baked by our loved ones. Our color palette consisted of mainly neutral and copper tones, allowing the greens of the trees and blue of the lake to provide the color.'
p4112
aS'We also incorporated some different textures like feathers, ferns, lace and patterned bow ties for the groom and his groomsmen. An after-ceremony tea time served as our cocktail hour, complete with hard sweet tea, lemonade, and freshly baked scones. As a girl who grew up in the south, this addition seemed quite fitting. All of these details made the day feel magical, even sacred, but our family and friends truly made this day the best day of our lives.\n'

S'If you ve followed this little ol  blog for any length of time you know when it comes to family backyard affairs, we re kind of obsessed. It s those Father of the Bride style weddings that completely leave us weak at the knees, and this Illinois  I do  is the latest on our list. Rooted in classic design and romantic tradition, the gallery from Lark Wedding Photography is bound to be an absolute hit.'
p4173
aS'From the Bride  When Justin and I got engaged, we immediately knew we wanted to have an intimate wedding and were able to convince my parents to have it at their house. With fewer than 40 people, we had the opportunity to really focus on the details of the day and do exactly what we wanted in terms of dcor, food, drink, flowers and everything in between. We wanted our wedding to be romantic, classic, and one that we can look back on in years to come and still look timeless.'
p4174
aS'My mother took the reins as our wedding planner extraordinaire and she spent over a year planning the most perfect day any of us could have imagined. With the help of her A team (nearly 40 of her closest friends!) almost every detail at our wedding was either borrowed, handmade, or given with love, and that made the day even more special than it already was. From the sterling silverware lent for each place setting, table numbers made from old forks, candles dressed up with handmade bling, and mason jars lining the aisle surrounded by lace with hearts, to the hours and hours friends spent making all the desserts that made up the sweets table, the day really wouldnt have been the same without the help of our friends and family.'
p4175
aS'We had our ceremony outside, followed by a cocktail hour with yard games for the kids (and the adults played too!). Our reception dinner was in the formal living room of the house, followed by cocktails and dancing in the family room overlooking the back patio, which was illuminated by dozens upon dozens of candle-lit lanterns, tree mounted votives, and candelabras.'
p4176
aS'Our colors were white and blush pink, which we felt added to the classic nature of the event.\n Guests were served blush pink champagne as they arrived through the white arbor leading to the ceremony site in the back yard. The cherry blossom trees were in full bloom, and in the light breeze the white and light pink petals fell across the ceremony site.'
p4177
aS'My flowers were blush pink peonies, and my broach bouquet (all of which were from my grandmothers collection) included only white crystals, and blush pink ribbon. The light champagne satin platform and handle of the broach bouquet was taken from the extra fabric of my wedding dress, and the bouquet itself was lovingly made by one of my mothers best friends. The flowers in the mason jars lining the aisles, and the arrangements at the guests tables for dinner, were all white, a touch of pink was included in the arrangement at our head table. The flowers on the arbor under which we were wed, were dried hydrangeas, and dried hops from our house Wisconsin. The chandelier hanging from the arbor had blush pink crystals as well, which worked well with our chosen color palette (a gift from one of my sisters from a small town in Pennsylvania during a family trip where I actually bought my dress).'
p4178
aS'We prayed for good weather for over a year and in the midst of the rainy, cold May Chicago had, we really hoped we would be able to have the backyard wedding we had dreamed and planned for. We had no backup plan for our outdoor ceremony and were very lucky to have a sunny seventy-degree day.'
p4179
aS'Our photographer truly captured the essence of our day and we will cherish the photographs for many years to come. All our vendors were a dream to work with and we would not change a thing about how the day turned out.\n'

S'We are the the deep, dark part of winter where it almost feels like spring will never come, but come it will, and after that will be summer, and with summer come weddings like this. Warmth and excitement, love and laughter, beauty in every detail  Ben Elsass Photography captured the stunning Chicago soiree and to warm your little hearts, we ve put it all in this pretty, pretty gallery!'
p4225
aS'From the stunning bride  Connie and I wanted a wedding that mirrored our relationship   somewhat sappy, super romantic, full of fun, and surrounded by our favorite people   our family and friends. For years, I ve dreamed of a barn wedding, but after deciding to get married in Chicago, that wasn t going to be possible. When we found Promontory Point, we instantly fell in love. With its beautiful wood beams and rustic feel, it was the closest we were going to get to getting married in a barn. Its location right along Lake Michigan with a breathtaking view of the Chicago skyline provided the perfect backdrop to the ceremony, and allowed us to include the city we love in our special day.'
p4226
aS' We wanted to create a day that included our passion for music, celebrated our roots, and showed our appreciation for our friends in family. We chose to have two live bands   a bluegrass band during the ceremony and cocktail hour, and an amazing band after dinner (One Night Band) that packed the dance floor for hours. During our ceremony, each of our guests were given a stone to hold and make a wish for our future. We collected the stones from Michigan and Wisconsin (our home states), and the stones are now sitting in a canning jar on our bookshelf as a constant reminder of the love and support we have around us.'
p4227
aS' When it came to the details, our amazing wedding planner, Katherine Brown from Greatest Expectations, helped us make our dream wedding a reality. Working with her and our florist, Forget Me Knot, we used wild-looking blue, orange and white flowers, burlap table linens and salvaged barn wood  table runners  to create a laid-back rustic elegance throughout the space. With a small guest count of 80, the long family-style tables allowed for everyone to mingle and enjoy each other s company. I incorporated my grandma s cameo into my bouquet, and wore both my mother and grandmother s garters. My brother read an excerpt from my favorite childhood book, The Velveteen Rabbit, during the ceremony, and we also used that book as our guestbook. Our favorite part of wedding preparation was taking dance lessons to prepare for our first dance. It was a much needed break from the hectic planning process to take a romantic time out to look into each other s eyes and fall in love all over again. The dance turned out to be an amazing part of our day as our first steps together as a married couple.'

S'Fall weddings and cozy cardigans go hand-in-hand. That s a fact. Just take a peek at this golden hued affair from the lens of Todd Pellowe. It s a celebration of all things autumn with plenty of natural elements thrown in for good measure. The gallery is bursting with inspiration for fall and DIY brides alike, and don t miss Ben Tamir Studios  film to watch it all unfold.'
p4292
aS'From the Bride  Evan and I had some of our first and favorite dates at Bryan Park while we were in college together at Indiana University, so when Evan proposed he popped the question in that very park a year after we had graduated and come back in town to celebrate homecoming weekend. So when we were deciding on a venue, using the spot under the very tree he proposed at in Bryan Park was a simple choice.'
p4293
aS'The whole idea for the wedding was centered around that spot in the fall. I wanted warm fall colors and a fun and casual feel for our guests. The reception venue at a local horse farm just south of campus fit right in with our idea. The rolling hills and the trees full of leaves changing color provided the perfect backdrop for the evening.'
p4294
aS'Our planner and florist helped bring the rest of our ideas to life with a mixture of warm mustard yellow tones, different shades of gray, and natural wood colors and textures combined with bold graphic designs in the table runners (hand-sewn by my mom), a ribbon chandelier, as well as contemporary floral arrangements to bring a more modern edge to the rustic venue. A DIY ceremony backdrop, Bloomington landmarks as table names, caramel apples for favors, a pie bar for dessert, a rice krispie groom s cake, homemade corn hole boards (painted by my sister-in-law), a bonfire for roasting marshmallows, a custom invitation suite made by a good friend, and homemade dog treats at dinner tables for our Brittany Spaniel, Ruby were some of the additions that made our wedding feel fun and personal to us.\n'

So we basically can t get enough of this beauty below. With beautiful blooms and styling from Hello Darling and gorgeous pictures from Dawn E. Roscoe, it goes without saying that this gallery shouldn t be missed. See even more here.'
p4326
aS'From the Bride From the moment we got engaged, we knew we wanted to have a Chicago wedding. It is where we met and live so we wanted to share the city with our guests. The JW Marriott in the heart of the city was a great location, and the Burnham Ballroom was a gorgeous setting for our ceremony and reception. The ballroom held some of Chicago s history (the original ceiling from 1914), while adding elegant, modern touches such as the beautiful chandlers.'
p4327
aS'Even though our wedding was in October, we wanted to stay away from traditional fall colors. Our ceremony & reception took place in the same room, so we needed a lot of guidance and creativity to make the space unique for each event. I had envisioned a romantic garden scene for the ceremony. Something I wasn t sure would be possible inside a ballroom. Natalie, from Hello Darling, along with her team helped to make my general ideas so much more than I could have ever imagined. The reception room was then transformed into a beautiful romantic setting and we danced the night away to music performed by the Stitely Orchestra.\n'

S'When a Martha Stewart team member ties the knot, you can bet your bottom dollar crafty wedding goodness is right around the corner. Just take this Harvest Moon Pond affair. Filled to the gills with color and whimsy, it s the kind of day that breaks all the rules in the very best way. Dani Stephenson snapped the whole shebang, and you can find every last giggly moment in the gallery right here.'
p4370
aS'From Dani Stephenson Photography  Valerie and I met last December over coffee at a roadside diner half way between us when she was home for the holidays. Valerie, originally from Wisconsin, went to college in Madison moved to New York, works for none other than Martha Stewart and met her love Glenn who works for a hockey team and is all New York, accent and all. I loved Valerie right away she was real, she was funny and genuine and I knew we would get along just fine.'
p4371
aS'As the year passed and I got some glimpses into her wedding plans I became more excited for this day to arrive. It was fabulous. The weather although, cold and rainy outside it didn t change a thing inside. The Barn At Harvest Moon Pond was warmed with friends and family and a crackling fire. Valerie has this infectious giggle and a vibrant personality and Glenn you can see is her rock, her steady and they balance each other so well.'
p4372
aS'As a modern couple, they did not uphold most of the typical wedding traditions. But the traditions they chose to share in I feel meant the very most. Valerie really honored Glenn and his family with touches of New York and his Jewish heritage, and also showed off her home state of Wisconsin with so many special  Made in Wisconsin  touches.'
p4373
aS'This barn is not typical  barn  it s the same shape and offers a beautiful rustic feel but its so much more. Then you add Valerie s vision and resources for quite a special day at the barn. The colors, the flowers and greenery, the ribbons..it was spectacular.\n'

S'Deep down in my heart, I m a nautical loving girl, so weddings like this pull heavily at my heartstrings. The thing I love the most about the day? The way Lasting Impressions and the gorgeous bride went with green and white  it was a fresh take on the nautical, lakeside soiree and I couldn t love it any more than I do. The whole thing, as captured by Melissa Oholendt, is sitting pretty right here!'
p4438
aS'From the planner  Lisa and Chuck s wedding took place on a stunningly beautiful June day in the backyard of Lisa s childhood home on the shores of Lake Minnetonka. However, the festivities really started one month before the wedding when Lisa and Chuck traveled back to Minnesota to  Bury the Bourbon  in the exact location they were saying their vows and, true to the Southern tradition, their wedding day arrived carrying blue skies, mild temperatures and a light (perfect) lake-driven breeze that kept their custom L + C flag, designed by Lisa s mom, waving all day long.'
p4439
aS'The day began, as all wedding days should, with the bride & groom surrounded by the people they love the most. The ladies sipped on Veuve upstairs in Lisa s bedroom as the guys convened in the sunroom with a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle, a bourbon that, over the years, had become a tradition of celebration within their friend group.'
p4440
aS'From the gorgeous custom Kathryn Conover gown Lisa wore to the beautiful Anne M. Cramer skirts (a designer local to Minnesota!) that adored the bridesmaids to the groom s custom blue linen suit by New York tailor Saint Laurie Merchant to the Collared Greens bowtie & ties that the groom and groomsmen wore, there was not a single detail left unattended.'
p4441
aS'They said their vows where the lake met the shore, with two of their closest friends as acting officiates. Excerpts from the Velveteen Rabbit were read & E.E. Cummings poem  I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart) was read in it s entirety as it played a very special role in Lisa & Chuck s past; when Chuck was deployed to Afghanistan, Lisa sent him with this poem on a piece of paper & Chuck has kept it in his wallet ever since. During the ceremony, Nicole Herzog   a very talented artist   started her work on a piece of artwork that would capture the essence of the day in painted form, including an appearance by Tucker   the family s black lab   who played an excellent ring bearer.'
p4442
aS'Post-ceremony, the couple sent their guests off to cocktail hour as they took a boat ride across their favorite lake with a custom  Just Married  sign on the back. During cocktail hour, guests mingled in the gardens and were served champagne and the couple s signature drinks; Chuck s was his favorite  dark & stormy  and Lisa s was her favorite  Lake Minnetonka Bootleg .'
p4443
aS'With the couple having attended college together in the South and now residing in New York City, many of the guests traveled to Minnesota from all over the country; as such it was important to the couple to not only make sure that guests felt taken care of and loved in an elegant & comfortable atmosphere but also meld together pieces of their past & present, all while showing off everything that Minnesota has to offer. They enlisted Sarah Trotter with Lasting Impressions to truly execute their vision and not a detail was missed.'
p4444
aS'While the guests enjoyed cocktail hour, Sarah & her team were putting the finishing touches on the tented reception. Instead of working with the customary navy stripes that is often thought of for lakeside weddings, a palette of green and white was used with much of the greenery & florals from Weber s Westdale consisting of ferns, hydrangeas and green mums to compliment the existing landscape & gardens.'
p4445
aS'Compasses helped guests find their seating assignments under the beautiful draped ceiling of the dinner tent from Apr s Party Rental with the table cards on display in nautical holders and named after different bays on Lake Minnetonka. Each table had both an elaborate hydrangea & fern based tall floral arrangement & beautiful rose based low floral arrangements to promote cross-table conversations. A fern was placed on top of the menu cards to tie in the look. The bride & groom s chairs were draped with a floral garland as a special little touch of importance. The result was a stunning dinner setting that was both meaningful to the couple & allowed the lakeside setting to shine.'
p4446
aS'After dinner the guests were served both a piece of wedding cake & a piece of the pecan pie Groom s cake and were invited to the dance tent as the dance floor officially opened with Belladiva s band & singers keeping the tent packed all night long and late night snacks of mini-burgers were served by D Amico Catering. At midnight, guests were ushered to the driveway to send off the couple in style with sparklers and treated to the perfect sweet treats, made by a local truffle maker in custom boxes by Letter Perfect. As the sparklers were lit and Lisa & Chuck made their sweet departure, guests were overheard commenting to their partners that they didn t want the beautiful night to ever end.'

p4482
aS'From Bridget Rochelle Photography  This gorgeous wedding is one of a kind! The groom is an arborist so the whole wedding was themed around trees which is perfect inspiration for the fall! Everything from centerpieces, venue location, to table names was tree-centered. The bride was absolutely stunning and she let the bridesmaids choose their own green dress in a few different shades.'
p4483
aS'We took some pictures of the girls and boys separately before the ceremony by taking a golf cart out to a beautiful bridge. Afterwards we had a gorgeous outdoor ceremony where the bride and groom planted a tree together symbolizing their growing relationship. Afterwards we had an amazing reception where they used an axe to cut the cake instead of a knife.'
p4484
aS'The whole day was stylized by Aubrey s mother Sandy Duncan. She designed and created the centerpieces. She even did all of the flowers. She is extremely talented which makes this DIY wedding even more amazing!'

Let s just say seriously good things are bound to result. Sarah Postma Photography snapped every inch of this cultural affair, and you can swoon one stunning photo at a time right over here.'
p4524
aS'From Sarah Postma Photography  The couple originally planned a private courthouse ceremony followed by a party for their closest friends and family at the Modern Wing. But, after some coaxing from family, they chose to hold a personalized ceremony in front of the gorgeous floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Millennium Park with all of their guests as witnesses.'
p4525
aS'The ceremony led immediately into dinner and socializing, with those closest to the couple delivering heartfelt toasts to honor them. It was truly beautiful to witness all of the love in the room! The space was expertly decorated by Kehoe Designs with centerpieces placed on the long tables in an ombre effect from red to purple to yellow. I especially loved the spotlight pattern they showcased on the clean walls in this perfectly modern space.\n'

S'I ve said it before, but it s definitely worth repeating: you Chicago lovelies really know how to throw a wedding.  Whether it s a sweet vintage affair, a modern party or an enchanted garden-esque soiree like this beautiful Ivy Room affair, you never fail to leave us speechless.  Throw in a stunning bride and an entire gallery of pretty captured by Robyn Rachel and, well  happy, happy Monday.  See it here.'
p4564
aS'From Robyn Rachel Photography  I am so thrilled to share this wedding with you all, it is one of my favorites of the year! The couple is so madly in love with each other and it shine through in the photos. The decor was so beautiful and unique, Sarah dreamed of having an enchanted garden wedding so naturally the Ivy Room was a perfect fit. The room was filled with pinks, white and greens and lanterns and chandeliers hung from above. They had a Chuppah made from hanging flowers and the card table adorned beautiful entwined tree filled with flowers. '
p4565
aS'From the Bride  Kalen and I always knew that we wanted to have our wedding in Chicago. After all, we met in the city and have always thrived on the urban hustle and bustle. Since The Ivy Room is situated in the heart of downtown, it seemed the perfect choice. But it wasn t until we toured the space, nestled between the State Street shops and Medinah Temple, that we became truly inspired. The courtyard was a metropolitan oasis, and we decided at that moment that we had to have an outdoor ceremony. One of our first design decisions was our chuppah, made of floating white lilies. This was the focal point of our ceremony, and it looked absolutely magical in front of the rich green ivy-covered brick edifice. At the end of the cocktail hour, Kalen and I snuck upstairs to the reception hall, opened the big French doors overlooking the courtyard, and gave a champagne toast to all of our family and friends. I truly felt like a princess up on that balcony! '
p4566
aS'After this idyllic photo shoot, everyone came inside for the reception, which was essentially an enchanted forest. Between the beautifully set tables were potted trees from which little tea lights glistened. Hanging over the dance floor were classic chandeliers juxtaposed with whimsical lanterns. Luckily the ceilings were high enough so that we didn t hit our heads during the hora! The energy was booming from start to finish, and no one wanted to leave, but when our guests made their way to the lobby at the end of the night they found a mirrored glass table covered in roses and all of our favorite candies. We had personalized Chinese take-out containers for them to place all the M&Ms, jelly beans, and Hershey kisses their hearts desired. It was a sweet goodbye to an unforgettable evening.'

It s a stunning Chicago History Museum setting meets beautiful peony-filled blooms from Vale Of Enna meets a bride and groom who are just soooo darn happy (it s contagious). All planned to perfection by LK Events, this is one can t miss gallery.  Join me there for so much more.'
p4606
aS'From the Bride  When Daniel and I got engaged, we knew that we wanted a Chicago wedding. We couldn t wait to bring our family and friends to the city that we call home. From start to finish, our love of Chicago inspired the entire weekend, including welcome cocktails at Gibsons Steakhouse, a guest room block at Public in the heart of the Gold Coast, and a historic wedding venue in Lincoln Park.'
p4607
aS'In choosing our venue, Daniel and I were set on an outdoor space for our ceremony and a classic space for our reception that could accommodate our 200-person guest list. The combination was surprisingly hard to find, even in a city as big as Chicago. Luckily, we found the Chicago History Museum, with its stunning stairwell entrance to Uihlein Plaza for our ceremony, a skyline view that would be the backdrop for our cocktail hour, and the elegant Chicago Room for our reception. The venue also fit perfectly with the classic color palette I had in mind   black, white, gray, and different shades of pink.'
p4608
aS'We next found our incredible photographer, Olivia Leigh. I had fallen in love with Olivia s photos on Style Me Pretty, and upon meeting her, I fell even more in love with her sweet, laid back personality. Looking back, hiring Olivia was the best decision that we made.'
p4609
aS'The rest of our vendor team developed from there. Other highlights were three amazing ladies who all helped bring my vision to life without breaking the bank   Grace Ha-Kim at Vale of Enna, who magically found peonies for me in the middle of July and turned four iron posts that we gave her into a gorgeous chuppah; Melanie Montoya at Fresh Invitation Studio, who custom-designed beautiful, Chicago-inspired stationery that fit perfectly with our theme; and Michele Martin at M Bride, who helped me find my dream gown, Monique Lhuillier s  Peony  in blush.'
p4610
aS'Our wedding day was perfect, and not just because Chicago had perfect weather for the first time all summer. We created a personal ceremony, drawing inspiration from a number of our friends  weddings, including the idea to have a close friend officiate. We walked down the aisle to instrumental versions of our favorite songs   Daniel to  Thunder Road  by Bruce Springsteen and me to  Falling Slowly  by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. And, we interpreted Jewish traditions like the  Seven Blessings  in a modern way that was meaningful to us.'
p4611
aS'Later that night, we dined on amazing food from Blue Plate, and two of our favorite items from around the city   Sprinkles Cupcakes and Lou Malnati s deep-dish pizza. And, our band Rendezvous brought the house down, nailing classics like  Proud Mary  and  I Want You Back , while also delivering the best version of Robin Thicke s  Blurred Lines  that we have ever heard.'
p4612
aS'Ultimately, the best part about our wedding was the company   the family and friends who traveled from near and far to be with us. Having our guests continue to tell us that they had as much fun as we did is simply the icing on the cake.'

aS'I got to marry my life partner and we got to infuse our love into a wedding celebration. As creative director of my design company, Life Made Pretty, Inc., I knew I wanted our wedding to be spectacular.'
p4662
aS'Our ceremony was a religious ceremony held at my childhood church, Philadelphia Romanian Church of God which is an amazing architectural church that is a Chicago Historical Landmark. Though I was anxious to walk down the aisle, I felt a sense of stillness and calm right before the doors opened for me. With my dad s hat in my hands, I was ready to walk down the aisle on my own with my dad with me in spirit. In lieu of writing out vows and saying them in person, we created a little film together discussing our relationship and at the end of the video we read our vows. This video made our ceremony, I loved that we were able to share our love story with our guests. (video is attached)'
p4663
aS'Our reception was held at an equally amazing location   an amazing spacious loft that had a view of the Chicago skyline. There was element of mystery for our guests who arrived at our reception location. When you walk up to the building there isn t an element of walking to a venue hall. It feels as if you are walking into a warehouse. Upon which an elevator operator awaits on a large elevator made to fit vehicles. As guest were brought up to the fifth floor loft they slowly heard the electric cello playing current pop songs. And when the stepped off the elevator they were wow d with chandeliers, amazing beverages, a *juice bar* and a vintage lounge area. Since the loft was a bare space, we had a blank canvas to work with. We were able to bring in crystal chandeliers and create an installation of branch arrangements with hanging crystals. With the mirror top tables, the chandeliers and the amazing panoramic view of the city the space was simply sparkled and felt magical.'
p4664
aS'The overall aesthetic was really an eclectic blend of everything I personally am attracted to. I love glamour, I love vintage elements and I really wanted to capture a swanky formal feeling with bowties and evening gowns. Our bridesmaids each wore floor length evening dresses in different styles. I wanted each of them to feel comfortable but most importantly I wanted each of them to feel absolutely beautiful.'
p4665
aS'We created custom invites with the help of our designer Jenn Oster   we created a story booklet of 4 pages. We also created a documentary style film together where we told our love story and then shared our vows. It s a must see! We get to cherish this forever.'
p4666
aS'Highlights of our wedding reception was seeing my mother-on-law and husband dance to a remake version of  Simple Man . Performed and recorded by my husband and his mom. Watching them dance to the slow acoustic version of this song made me extremely emotional as Benja s mom was recovering for ovarian cancer. It was a moment I will cherish always.'
p4667
aS'All in all, our wedding was extremely custom, we put thought energy and love into each of the elements whether it was the food, music, fashion, design  we put a lot of heart into our wedding, and for this it will always be memorable because we made it our own.'
p4668
aS'Best day of our lives.'

S'The very first image of this beautiful bride with the stunning Chicago skyline behind her has stolen my heart, locked it up for good, and thrown away the key. In fact, the whole beautiful soiree is the heartbreaker kind  though with the bountiful love and joy radiating from every one of Jaclyn Simpson s images, no hearts will be broken  just stolen.'
p4718
aS'From the stunning bride  Michael and I knew from the start that we wanted a Chicago wedding. We both love this city and have had many great memories here. Finding a venue in the windy city was no easy task   there are so many gorgeous locations, but the Chicago History Museum was really perfect for us. It offered a picturesque outdoor pavilion for the ceremony, and an elegant reception space indoors with a grand chandelier and a classic checkered dance floor. Michael and I immediately knew this was where we wanted to get married.'
p4719
aS'Our wedding day was absolutely perfect and we are so thankful!! It was a mild September afternoon with a slight breeze and clear skies. The outdoor ceremony proceeded as planned with a hand release of doves as a symbol of our unity, and a flock of doves released from baskets during our first kiss! Doves choose one partner for life and have been used throughout history as a symbol of love, peace, faithfulness, and prosperity. We wanted this to represent the love and commitment we gave to each other on our wedding day.'
p4720
aS'After the ceremony, guests enjoyed cocktails and hors d oeuvres from Chicago s famous Berghoff and perused the exhibits inside the museum. During that time, a private Chinese tea ceremony took place in the bridal room with a few close family members. I m glad we were able to incorporate some traditional Chinese elements such as the     symbol which means double happiness and promises an auspicious occasion.'
p4721
aS'The reception space was absolutely breathtaking, as Kelly from Fleur, Inc. brought my visions to life. She created two sets of centerpieces   a classic trio of vases with submerged green orchids surrounded by succulents of complimentary colors, and an airy tall arrangement of baby s breath with flickering tea lights. Guests enjoyed delicious entrees and danced to music sung by Louise from the Louise Kelly Jazz Trio of Backthird Entertainment. Her piano / vocal rendition of our first dance song was amazing! It made our first dance just that much more special!'
p4722
aS'At the end of the night, guests gathered outside to send Michael and I off on our horse carriage ride to the hotel. Being in a carriage with a white horse in my wedding dress made me feel like an absolute princess   and having my handsome prince by my side was just the perfect way to end a flawless day.'
p4723
aS'We couldn t have wished for a better wedding day and thank Misha from Liven It Up Events for coordinating every detail. We couldn t have done it without her! Last but not least, we are so lucky to have found Jaclyn, our photographer, who captured beautiful images that we will treasure forever.'

S'Oh, young love.  The days of Jr. High dances, passing notes and singing along earnestly to the newest Bryan Adams  love song  I think we can all agree, Valentine s Day was sooo awesome back then.  So this darling school-themed shoot from Jody Savage, Cocoa & Fig, Simply Loves and Paperista is, well  basically the best thing ever.  See it all right here.'
p4768
aS'From Jody Savage Photography  My stylist Shauna from Simply Loves and I wanted to design a shoot around the upcoming Valentine s Day. We got to thinking about young love and when we were in school and received cute valentines from the boys we had crushes on and the idea for the shoot was born- centered around young, hopeful, innocent love.'
p4769
aS'We incorporated paper Valentine bags like when we were kids, but brought a sophisticated modern twist to it with the help of stationary extraordinaire Paperista. Overall we were going for a muted, romantic palate, not just the typical red or pink. We loved the light blue wedding gown Morgan was wearing and highlighted it with the invites and French ribbon on the table. Brent s suit brought in the colors and textures in the invitations, flowers and ribbon.'
p4770
aS'We also wanted to bring in a bit of fun with the school theme by bringing in a chalkboard, desk, and globes. However, we played up the Valentine s theme by adding a lovely backdrop of ribbon and bunting to reminisce about the school yard pretend marriages we had during recess- again with a sophisticated, romantic twist. We added chocolate hearts and tulips to surprise our lovely bride like many receive on Valentine s Day from their loves.'
p4771
aS'Finally our table was just gorgeous and tied it in all together with the chalkboard slate table top, valentines bags on each place setting, chalkboard designs and beautiful flowers by the very talented Ashley Fox Designs.'
p4772
aS'And to top it all off Cocoa & Fig provided us with a number of different yummy desserts including macaroons, heart shaped pies, sugar cookies and a lovely icy white cake to go with our winter in Minnesota.'

S'I love getting dressed up and going out just as much as the next person, but I firmly believe that some of the best Valentine s Days you ll ever spend are the ones you spend at home.  Those are the days spent breakfasting in bed and cuddling with your honey  and this beautiful shoot from Jordan Brittley and Stellar Staging & Design?  Well, it captures those moments perfectly.  See them all right here.'
p4796
aS'From Jordan Brittley  I am SO excited to share this Valentine s Day inspiration shoot with you. It s full of macarons, tea cakes, gorgeous flowers and a couple keeping their promises. The inspiration for this shoot came from a C.S. Lewis quote:  It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit.  We want to encourage people to delight in the everyday mundane and rejoice in a bold love.'
p4797
aS'Catherine wore leggings and a long shawl that looked like a beautiful white blanket and Nick wore jeans and a white t-shirt. They shared dessert in bed and read to each other. We chose to keep things simple because every day life is simple and it s all about enjoying what is right in front of you: love.'
p4798
aS'From Stellar Staging & Design  It seems as though so many of us think love is something that just  happens  to us if we re in the right place at the right time  in some ways I suppose that s true. This past year my husband and I celebrated our 10th anniversary, and I ve been thinking a lot about what it means to be married, to be  in love , to LOVE.'
p4799
aS'I happened upon this quote by C. S. Lewis and have been so inspired by it (by the whole chapter, really!):'
p4800
aS'   love as distinct from  being in love    is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit. '
p4801
aS' Lewis talks about being  in love  verses choosing to love  he says,  Being  in love  first moved them to promise fidelity: this quieter love enables them to keep the promise. It is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it. '
p4802
aS'LOVING someone, in this case marriage, is really difficult. It s a lot of work. I d say it s by far the hardest thing I ve ever done.  But  it s also the best thing I ve ever done. It s worth it in every way.'
p4803
aS'We wanted something attainable. We wanted it comfy, cozy, casual.  We thought a fluffy white duvet was perfectly classic, with simple pillows to accent. Natural colored sheer curtains with just a tad bit of texture were a beautiful backdrop. Cat brought a most perfect shawl for the shoot!!! She & Nick are so cute and comfortable and they did a really great job!'

It s almost like you Windy City lovebirds possess a special  classic wedding  gift (seriously), one that s shining brighter than ever in this gorgeous Ritz-Carlton affair.  A fairytale stunner from start to finish, it s beautiful blooms from Phillips Florist meets a stunning Anne Barge gown meets all kinds of lovely from Julia Franzosa.  See it all here.'

p4837
aS'From Julia Franzosa  This was an absolutely stunning wedding at The Ritz-Carlton Chicago with a beautifully down-to-earth couple. Michael and Jodi made all of the wedding decisions together but the most important thing for them was  to feel the love and happiness and be able to read their self-written vows to one-another.'
p4838
aS'The wedding was elegant but still low-key and beautiful within the fabulous ballroom of the Ritz-Carlton. Their ceremony took place under a simple white draped chuppah in front of their closest friends and family. It was important for them to keep some traditional aspects to their wedding but they also wanted to be able to connect before their ceremony. We set up a  first look, no look  so they could hold hands and talk for a few moments just the two of them.'
p4839
aS'After the ceremony, we took family portraits in front of the chuppah while the guests enjoyed a lovely cocktail hour. The bridal party ventured outside in the chilly Chicago weather for a few photos.'
p4840
aS'The reception also took place in the grand ballroom with mixes of golds, purples and greens. After the introductions they cut their cake followed by the traditional dances. The best father dance I have been a part of, was to Bob Marley. It was adorable! Michael and Jodi danced the night away and are one of the most genuine couples I have ever had the privilege of working with.'

It s literally layered in lovely, and honestly, you can t get better than that. One look at this gallery and you ll be head over heels, and you can get a peek at all the pretty right here.'
p4878
aS'From Studio Starling Laura and Ryan fell in love. They were married at the Chicago History Museum on a glorious September afternoon. The ceremony was outdoors and the light was warm and the guests were smiling. The day began at the Sheraton Towers in a suite with 180 degree views of the city. We gasped at the light and all the wonderful props the room had to offer for still life photos. We gasped with joy once again when we realized we were working with both of our studio mates LOLA Event Productions and Cornelia McNamara florist.'
p4879
aS'Laura and Ryan walked the river walk and around the Caldwell Lily Pool for portraits. The day was luminous, the couple was stunning and their bridal party kept the laughs coming. While we were out, the Chicago History Museum was being made beautiful by the creative crew. The ceremony space was gorgeous with the view extending into Lincoln Park, the dining room was filled with flowers and so many wonderful details to regard. LOLA Event Productions was wildly creative using some antique doors for the seating chart and Corneilia McNamara put together over 70 arrangements for the event. Each table setting was lovingly put together by this team. A perfect day for a wonderfully perfect loving couple.'
p4880
aS'From LOLA Event Productions Vintage elegance was the design inspiration for this event. The bride wanted to mesh the elegant backdrop of the museum with her preferences for vintage and very natural touches. The shine of the shantung linen and hemstitched napkins by BBJ were the perfect compliment to the elegant neutral and blush blooms finished with vintage milk glass and jadeite floral vessels and barn board table runners by Cornelia McNamara. LOLA Event Productions added special touches like a collection of old doors and windows turned table assignment display flanking the entrance to the museum.'

S'I stand in constant awe of the brides that parade through our pages every single day. They re crafters and dreamers who plan the most beautiful affairs you have to stop and remind yourself they re real. I m talking brides just like this Wisconsin beauty who DIYed her way to the perfect Midwest wedding. She left no detail untouched and we ve got the full gallery from The McCartneys right here.'
p4931
aS'From the Bride  We really wanted to incorporate who we were as people and as a couple. Our history, interests and memories. We wanted our guests to arrive and see elements that were not just pretty but meaningful. We felt that if we were going to put effort into decorating, we needed it to say something. We each, of course had our own hobbies and interests that we wanted to be present, but the whole idea was mutual. Jodi, really wanted a twinkle light, romantic atmosphere. Having the wedding at Greenwood Hills under a tent made that dream happen as well!'
p4932
aS'Our vision or theme was  the story of us.  We also wanted it to be rustic, soft and vintage. So we wanted to intertwine both of those. We had a lady named Janis Vandermeer really help our vision come to life. Jodi sat down with her and told her she wanted our story to be told. Janis and Jodi came up with the idea of having different interests, hobbies or memories on each table. We came up with the list of tables, and the hunt was on to find items that would go, however we wanted to keep in mind our vintage twist.'
p4933
aS'We initially wanted to reception to be at Jodi s farm, in her barn, because that would totally go along with our theme, but so many factors turned us away, but we really wanted to find a venue that had the same atmosphere. An atmosphere that felt welcoming, natural but yet a blank palette for us to decorate. What better space than outdoors.'
p4934
aS'We were very limited to our options, but honestly we were glad. Greenwood Hills was our perfect place. Being on a hill, out on the greens with a tent up, we could not ask for a better setting. We could decorate as we wished and have the outdoors still be in sight! This setting created such a welcoming natural feel, it was perfect for the style we wanted!'
p4935
aS'DIY Elements: The chalkboard centerpieces: Cut by Jodi s dad, sanded by Brent and painted by Jodi. The seating plan sign at the ceremony: Pieces of wood given by Jodi s cousin. Hammered together by Jodi s dad and painted by Jodi. Gift tag name tags: Tags were bought on Etsy, then spray painted with chalk board paint and strung with twine from Michaels. All by Jodi. Cake Topper: Made by Jodi. Started with clothes pins, and wooden balls from Michaels. Jodi had to sand down the tops of the clothes pins for the wooden balls to fit on top. Jodi then use lace ribbon from Michaels for the dress and an old t-shirt sleeve for the tux. She painted the faces and added final details from items bought at Michaels. Quilt Squares: Brent s mom cut every quilt square and intends to sow them all together to make a quilt for Brent and Jodi.'
p4936
aS'Advice to other brides: This is cliche, but it must be said again, you are given your full engagement to prepare for your wedding, don t sweat the small stuff, and when the day arrives, let it all go, whatever happens will happen, embrace it, it will all be part of the memory. It goes way to fast to worry.\n'

S'Truth be told, it s the rich, ultra romantic hues that ll always reign supreme in my book. Hues like the berries and purples that take center stage in this lush, fall affair from Lauren Gabrielle Photography. It s stunning in every way, but don t just take my word for it. Have a full-on swoon for yourself right over here.'

aS'From A Charming Fete  The design for Danielle and Austin s wedding was Tuscan-inspired with a rich, romantic color palette of deep aubergine, shades of plum, cream and dusty rose with touches of antique metallics. We wanted to achieve that warm, plentiful Tuscan vibe in a more refined, modern setting. Vintage style urns and vessels lined the king s tables with an abundance of lush flowers and ripe fruit (plums, pears and grapes) overflowing onto the tabletop.'
p4986
aS'The place settings were anchored with beautiful ivory and gold china and custom menus. We wanted friends and family to feel like they were being seated at a rich and elegant feast. The chocolate linens gave the tables a dark, earthy feel. The ceremony and reception space boasts tons of marble, massive arched ceilings and elaborate columns which gave the perfect balance to our Tuscan tablescape. We incorporated some fun details like mini olive oil bottle seating cards and a decadent dessert bar with handmade backdrop. The wedding cake was beautiful in its own simplicity which we adorned with a few fresh blooms.'
p4987
aS'A gorgeous, lush backdrop was constructed for the ceremony which including tons of dripping vines and foliage mixed with florals. This served as a focal point throughout the reception and a backdrop to the couple s sweetheart table. The bride paired some chic vintage-inspired jewels and accessories with her gown, including a gorgeous faux fur chubby. The end result was breathtaking and timeless.\n'

S'When a couple is this adorable, you know you are in for a pretty amazing wedding.  Why?  Because adorable duos like this just have a way of throwing a pretty party.  Parties that include gorgeous DIY details, vibrant pops of blue and pink and enough love-filled moments to fill an entire gallery with pure, unadulterated happy.  See it all captured by Robyn Rachel Photography right here.'
p5026
aS'From the Bride  It all started when Kevin and I returned to Tabor Hill Winery, the location of one our first dates. This trip to the winery turned out to be one we will never forget for it is where he proposed. From that day on our wheels were turning and the planning process began. Location was first and boy was that a wild goose hunt! We wanted to do something a little different, an experience for our guests and a special place for us to visit for years to come. After several road trips and a little frustration, we found Galena, IL. It had the country charm and small town feel we were looking for, not to mention it was a place we both visited together. Eagle Ridge s Ballroom had the scenery we were in search of, as well as the simple elegance, that could also accommodate our guest. But we were not done there; we needed to find a ceremony location. Both being bought up Catholic, it was important to us to become husband and wife in the Catholic Church. To add an extra touch we invited a priest from back home to say our mass. Other items of importance were finding a photographer and videographer to capture our big day! Luck led us to Robyn and Jason, who thanks to our promptness in scheduling were both available. We had 100% confidence that we would be  wowed  with their depictions of our memory. A day of video was on our wish list, since we knew the day would pass us by. We wanted to be able to watch the day unfold together with each other and with our guests.'
p5027
aS' Kevin will be the first to tell you that me and decisions are foes, so wedding details were not always rainbows and butterflies. But having our vision we were determined to include the little touches that would important to us. We wanted to make it meaningful to us as well as loved ones. It was important to include everyone in one way or another and choosing a bridal party of 20 plus a ring bearer and flower girl was one way to start. From there we thought about people whom would only be there in spirit. I carried these relatives close, carrying a locket of my late grandma and grandpa, so they could  be there too.  Having come from wonderful relationship role models, we wanted to show off the family love by displaying the weddings of our parents, Kevin s sister and brother-in law, and our grandparents. When it came to favors, we wanted to honor the handfuls of people who have fought the battle with cancer by donating to the American Cancer Society. We also wanted to capture the innocence of love by a few special 8 and 9-year love doctors! Being a 3rd grade teacher, I wanted to incorporate my little buddies into our day. They helped by defining what love it with quotes that became our table numbers. And the DIY went on from there; maybe it is the teacher in me, from dollies punch place settings to initial signage to hang in our new home for remembrance of the most special days of our lives. We had everyone on board cutting ribbons, spray-painting frames, printing and folding programs and menus all to make the day  us.  It turned out to be more than we could ever imagine definitely the classy summer feeling surrounded by love and scenery we were hoping for!'

S'I truly feel like this bride and I are kindred spirits. Just like me, she s a Midwest girl who believes in the magic of winter, and wed her love on the snowiest of days. But what s left me loving her even more are all the handmade moments she and her ladies crafted all along the way. Paper Antler perfectly documented every last bit, and we ve got even more snowy goodness you Simply. Can t. Miss.'
p5061
aS'From the Bride  I ve always loved winter, and growing up in Wisconsin, some of my favorite memories are of blustery cold days, snowed in at home with a fire burning in the fireplace. I wanted to replicate that cozy feeling   of being so incredibly content and warm despite the frigid weather outdoors   for our friends and family at our December wedding. With that as our foundation, Dan and I decided on two additional goals for our day: first of all, we wanted to throw a good party; secondly, we wanted to infuse a classic, vintage element, including books, books and more books (because what s a snow day without a pile of good books to read?).'
p5062
aS'We didn t have to search long to find our perfect reception venue. When we saw the gorgeous floor-to-ceiling windows, crystal chandeliers and neutral tones that played flawlessly into the ivory and metallic color scheme we envisioned, we booked Lake Windsor Golf Club on the spot. To add the element of eras gone by, we collected old books, typewriters, and mismatched items such as teacups, candleholders, gravy boats and serving bowls from flea markets, thrift stores and relatives  homes. The larger vintage items such as the suitcases, hinged door and chalkboard signs came from an amazing vintage rental company in Madison, A La Crate (I could live in their warehouse!). My favorite decorations were the old photographs of our parents  and grandparents  weddings displayed with the cakes. They not only added a touch of intimacy, but created priceless opportunities to talk to our family about their weddings and marriages as we planned ours.'
p5063
aS'A large portion of our day was do-it-yourself and only completed thanks to the love and time of those closest to us. One of my bridesmaids, a brilliantly talented graphic designer, designed our invitations. My mother helped me paint the wooden table numbers gold, create the metallic custom paper signs, and (tirelessly) spent days upon days hot gluing silver and gold tinsel to bamboo skewers to use as stir sticks for the cocktail hour. Dan s sister, an incredibly talented artist, hand-lettered the beautiful chalkboard designs hung throughout the venue, and my grandmother made the flower girls  dresses along with my veil. One memory I know I ll cherish forever was staying up late on the eve of our wedding with my bridesmaids and mother-in-law assembling the centerpieces, bouquets and boutonnieres.'
p5064
aS'The one thing we forgot to plan was our exit. As the night wore on, we completely lost track of time, celebrating with our guests until the venue starting locking the doors, and it was only then that we realized we didn t have a ride home! Dan s sister gave us a lift, and after all was said and done, we couldn t have asked for a more perfect celebration to start our lives together as husband and wife.'
p5065
aS'We also want to give a shout out to the kind and talented people we are so grateful to have worked with, such as Jonny and Michelle from Paper Antler, Jennifer and Beth from Lake Windsor, and Pastor Dave and his wife Nancy from Blackhawk Church, and many others. Thank you! It was an absolute dream day for us, and I, for one, felt as if I was curled up in front of a fireplace the entire time.\n'

Yes, you lovelies in Illinois can host a seriously chic city affair OR a farm friendly set of nuptials (I m jealous), like this lovely day captured by Michael Novo.  It s lush blooms meets breathtaking blue skies meets all kinds of Oak Hill wonderful.  See it all here.'
p5090
aS'From Michael Novo  Galena, IL and the surrounding area is not the first place that comes to my mind when it comes to weddings. The reason for this is because if anything, I m usually heading out there to go skiing, wine tasting or simply seeking it out as a destination for a motorcycle ride. But it s quite the hidden gem that s not too far from Chicago. Oak Hill was the venue which Danielle and Adam selected to celebrate their pseudo-destination wedding! It offers an on-site chapel, a home to get ready in, a tented pavilion for the reception and many other little treasures around the property.'
p5091
aS'The first impression that you get when you arrive is  relaxed country . When you re in Chicago, there are very few venues with such a wide open and spacious feel. Heading an hour or two west will solve all of your space needs. With wide open fields, plenty of trails and a massive property that s reserved for your wedding only, it s an easy choice of places to host your wedding for those wanting something different. Oak Hill is a great location and offers up a genuine vintage feel, without having to travel too far outside of Chicago. It gets a photographic stamp of approval!'

S'This wedding is so beautiful and happy, it can make anyones day, even those of us who might be feeling a little under the weather (guilty). Seriously the first little peek at Kelly Sweet Photography s images and the color came back to my cheeks   the English garden-esque setting is just that amazing. And the couple? Adorable.'
p5131
aS'From the beautiful bride  Southern Exposure was selected as the Ceremony site because I had photographed a Wedding there several years before and knew instantly that this was where I wanted to get married. The character, offered by detail, that goes into every room and every decoration, is amazing. As a photographer, I found every space was a great place to take a picture at this location. The natural garden setting is extremely conducive to breathtaking photographs. The overall theme of the Wedding was a vintage/shabby chic feel, so Southern Exposure s compound was a perfect setting. My husband, Jake s one concern about Wedding location was that he wanted it to be a place that we could come back to and enjoy. Southern Exposure s Specialty Dining and Workshops that are offered throughout the year offer perfect opportunities for Jake and I to revisit our day together. Another basic draw to Southern Exposure was that it offered numerous accommodations and services that made the day easier both our families and us. For example, Southern Exposure provides most of the decorations, in their surroundings, alone. They grow and maintain all of the plants on site, so many of the flowers and back drop options were already taken care of. Also, all of the decorations for the Reception were set up and broken down by Southern Exposure staff. They loaded the gifts into our vehicles for us and sent us off.'
p5132
aS'I knew my wedding gown had to be elegant, a reflection of my vintage inspired, romantic, garden ceremony. I was reluctant at first to try the fit-and-flare style, but after seeing myself in the bridal mirror, I instantly knew this was the one! I loved the beautiful lace and unique beaded floral embellishments and the fit was amazing! My gown was a lace fit-and-flare gown with floral detailing on the bodice and skirt designed by Oleg Cassini. I added custom-made sheer cap sleeves with embellishments taken from the body of my gown after alterations. My veil was simple and sheer and ran the complete length of the train.'
p5133
aS'I was fortunate to have a seamstress who was able to customize my mother s wedding gown from 1984 into a beautiful getting ready gown that I can pass down to my two sisters. The high neckline was removed and part of the sleeves leaving the bodice and long sheer lace overlay skirt. Silk Ribbons were added and the getting ready gown tied elegantly over my bridal slip set.'
p5134
aS'My ceremony shoes were designed by Michelangelo and customized by professional seamstress, Laurie Morrison. They were short-heel, open-toe shoes, dyed Cinderella blue. We customized the shoes even further, by adding lace, buttons, and bows from my Mother s Wedding gown to the back of the shoes. On the front of the shoes, embellishments from my gown were added to complete the look. My shoes are very special to me because they combine a touch of my Mother s wedding gown, my wedding gown, and a small piece of my favorite fairy tale, Cinderella. They completely encompassed the tradition of something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. For the reception, I chose black and white tap shoes, perfect for dancing, inspired by Michael Jackson s famous dance shoes.'
p5135
aS'My wedding jewelry included a diamond heart shaped necklace passed down to me by my Nanny. I wore 2 silver diamond bracelets, 0ne was given to me by my Nanny, the other was given to me by my other grandmother. The earrings I planned to wear bought by my mother at an antique store months earlier were missing. Thankfully my other Grandmother had the perfect solution. She gave me her beautiful Pearl and diamond earrings! The diamonds matched my necklace and bracelets and the pearls matched the earring and bracelet sets I had given all of my Bridesmaids to wear for the wedding. These pieces completed my elegant look and meant I was able to wear a piece of jewelry from three of my grandmothers.'
p5136
aS'Before the wedding after we were all dressed and while the  finishing touches  were being added to our hair and make-up in the Bridal Suite, my Father serenaded us on the piano, playing original pieces and familiar songs from my childhood as he tried not to cry. Set on the piano were several very sentimental pictures from my childhood and of my late grandmothers. My father was very touched to be included, doing what he loves, and having this special time with them.\n'

S'When Stacy Able Photography sent over this beautiful wedding, I was drawn in instantly. With the Chicago skyline as the backdrop, the nautical wedding has all the makings of a favorite: DIY elements, beautiful fashion, and stripes, of course. And not to mention, a beautiful couple at the center!'
p5179
aS'From the Photographer  Meg and Spencer s wedding was full of family, friends, and a crazy fall Chicago thunderstorm with tornado warning. Despite the booming thunder and downpours, Meg gracefully did not let it bother her. I really enjoyed hanging out with the bridesmaids and her as they got ready at the Hotel Lincoln as talking with Meg it is like she s an old friend.'
p5180
aS'Every last detail, Meg and Spencer out did themselves. From the large boat they painstakingly painted that displayed the place cards, to the vases wrapped with rope, these two threw an elegant nautical affair. The entire wedding party wore Sperry shoes which fit the theme perfectly.'
p5181
aS'From the stunning bride   A former mentor of mine used to start every bridal consultation with the question  what do you want your guests to walk away saying? . Early in our relationship, Spencer and I agreed we wanted people to say  that was an amazing, crazy, insane wedding! .'
p5182
aS'As an active sailor, Spencer grew up in the northern suburbs of Chicago sailing Lake Michigan and summering in Maine. I am originally from Northern California and grew up going to Ludington, Michigan every summer. Needless to say, we both feel the most relaxed when near large bodies of water. Once engaged, we coordinated a site visit of the Chicago Yacht Club s Monroe Harbor (downtown Chicago) with their fabulous Catering Director, Kate Newton. We were about to sign the contract when Spencer noticed that there was a Belmont Station of Chicago Yacht Club only a few blocks from where we lived. After viewing the Belmont Station location, we knew we had found the perfect location! The Chicago Yacht Club, Belmont Station is the perfect amount of nautical combined with the laid back feel of Lincoln Park   and not to mention one of this best (and exclusive) views of Chicago s skyline.'
p5183
aS'After selecting the venue, we went with a nautical inspiration for our big day. Both Spencer and I love DIY projects   and we are fortunate enough to have amazing family & friends to help! We found an old wooden dinghy at the Randolph Street Market and repurposed it to hang out place cards. We purchased cylindrical vases from the dollar store and wrapped them with brown rope. A friend donated 18 red and blue lanterns, which we spray painted a brush, hammered bronze color. Although our beloved schnoodle, Rambo, was not present, a miniature sculpture of our pup was created for our cake topper.'
p5184
aS'I woke up at 5AM the day of the wedding to the television blaring weather warnings. I know that rain is supposed to be good luck on a wedding day, but the weather man was saying hail and potential tornado   what was that superstition?! The rain held off until 3:45PM, just as the ladies were heading to the venue. Thankfully, we had prepared for rain and had a backup option. Our guests swear it provided an intimate event having 170 people huddled on the deck of the sailing school as the rain fell behind us! The rain lifted at 4:45PM just as the ceremony was ending   perfect timing for pictures. The less than ideal weather had produced breathtaking clouds and, later, turned the entire sky this pink-purple color. It was truly magical!'
p5185
aS'Words cannot express how thankful Spencer and I are to have had our family and closest friends gathered around us for this very special day. Looking back on the day, we both laugh and say  that was an amazing, crazy, perfect wedding! - totally and completely the way we imagined it!\n'

S'Big city weddings tend to be some of the most style-driven affairs that grace our pages. But with brides who ve got art, culture and endless inspiration all around them, it s really no wonder. The perfect example? This Chicago  I do  captured by Tim Tab Studios. It s stylish to the absolute max, and there s lots more waiting for you here!'
p5227
aS'From the Bride  Greg and I met in college at the University of Wisconsin. When I was deciding where to attend law school, Greg still had one more year of college to finish. I told him I chose Chicago over the West Coast because of the city and the school   but secretly I also knew it was only a two and a half hour drive from Madison. When Greg graduated, he turned down all of his full time employment opportunities for a three-month internship that allowed him to move to Chicago too. Two and half years later, he surprised me by taking me on a very special tour of the city. We stopped at all the places that were special to us, took polaroids, drank champagne, and eventually ended up on the rooftop of our apartment building where he proposed.'
p5228
aS'Chicago was the perfect choice for our wedding. We wanted a traditional wedding that was also romantic, urban, and really, really fun. Our top priorities were finding a unique reception venue that would reflect our style and finding a band that would keep all of our guests on the dance floor. We loved the Chicago Illuminating Company as soon as we stepped inside. The lofty ceilings, oversized standing mirrors and paintings, black and white details, giant built-in bars, outdoor courtyard  there s so much to love! When we found out it was available on a Saturday only six months away, we quickly set the date and got to work. Who says you need a year to plan a wedding? We couldn t wait to be married. The next step, choosing our band, was easy. Greg s three-month internship had since become a full time job directing a music festival. He had taken me to see JC Brooks and the Uptown Sound several times, and even had them slated to play the festival that summer. We were incredibly excited when they said they would play at our wedding, and they didn t disappoint- eventually leaving our reception with all of our guests chanting for one more song.'
p5229
aS'We focused on incorporating summery colors and lots of different textures into the flowers, food, and decor. Entertaining Company immediately caught on to the feel of our wedding and created a fun and delicious menu, including bite-sized shepards pies sitting on top of mini-mugs of Guinness and fresh muddled lemonade cocktails. Some of our favorite touches included the outdoor furniture vignettes put together by the Ivan Carlson team and handmade, personalized decorations created by my mom, my sister, and a family friend. Tim and Bethany captured it all, and we were practically giddy when we saw the photos. We feel incredibly blessed and thankful to have had such a beautiful wedding day surrounded by friends and family.\n'

S'I ll be honest, wedding blogger though I am, I would have never have dreamt of a vegetable themed wedding. But these vegetarian lovers did. And I m here to be the first to tell you that it is amazing. Almond Leaf Studios captured brussel sprouts in boutonnieres, asparagus in bouquets, and a vegan carrot cake, all of which are prettier than you could ever imagine!'
p5270
aS'From the lovely bride  We envisioned a weekend that enabled us to spend quality time with as many family and friends that made the trek up to Traverse City. Our wedding day was designed to be an accurate representation of who we are individually and our relationship. Being vegan/vegetarian s and having a father of the bride who is an avid gardener, vegetables play a critical ingredient in our daily lives. Homegrown vegetables from our father s garden were used to create a brilliant variety of centerpieces unique to each table. This was carried over into our boutonnieres, corsages, and wedding bouquets, which were made with Brussels sprout heads and green beans. Not to mention that we had bell peppers at the end of our guests seats for the ceremony!'
p5271
aS'Along with our tie to vegetables we had a sentimental wedding ceremony. Being from Michigan and California we wanted to represent both the Great Lakes and the Pacific Ocean. We thought the best way to do this would be to mix fresh water from Lake Michigan with salt water from the Pacific Ocean. Our unity water was poured over Michigan s state stone, the Petoskey stone.'
p5272
aS'In lieu of wedding favors of our guests we made a donation to a charity very near and dear to our hearts, Crohn s & Colitis Foundation of America. Both my father and I suffer from Crohn s disease, a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines. This year marks six years of my diagnosis and my father was diagnosed six months before our wedding. The day of our wedding was his last official dosage of steroid before starting his maintenance medication. We will fight to the end for a cure!'
p5273
aS'Our most memorable moment was seeing our beautiful guests all seated together during our ceremony underneath the lakeside trees. The ceremony was beautiful, the lighting was perfect, the messages read were unique and the love was bountiful.'
p5274
aS'Our first dance song was River by Emile Sande; a great British artist whom we both fell in love with during the months leading up to our wedding. Her song, River sends a great message about genuine relationships and standing behind one another.'
p5275
aS'Our guests were treated with a great variety of locally sourced fare from the Old Mission Peninsula. The entree choices ranged from grilled Filet Mignon with red wine veal reduction, pan seared salmon with capers, tomatoes and lemon beurre blanc, pan roasted slow cooked chicken breast with morel chicken jus, and a special vegan option all prepared onsite by Chef Paul Olson (also the bride s late maternal grandfather s name). For dessert we served a variety of pies including cherry crumb, Dutch apple, peach crumble, very berry, and strawberry rhubarb from the Cherry Street Market along with a delicious vegan carrot cake from Robin Smith s Cakes. Our evening snack included an outdoor s more bar for guests to roast delicious treats by the fire!'
p5276
aS'There were a lot of DIY touches in the ceremony and reception. Our sister, Jen Bannister designed all of our paper goods (i.e. wedding invites, programs, drinks menus, seating cart, name cards etc.) All of our outside wooden signs were designed and built by our parents. In the reception hall our generous parents created the windowpane with our deceased family members, the burlap table runners, and the cake/pie sticks, and s more sticks. Instead of a guest book we created a personalized calendar for our guests to write a message on their birthdate. We had endless number of DIY projects that made our day  us !'

S'For these Chicago sweeties, saying  I do  was all about creating an experience to remember. From their sweet church ceremony to a rustic chic reception at Gallery 1028, it was the careful planning and thoughtful details that made the day perfect. Amanda Megan Miller was on hand to capture, and she snapped up this gallery of goodness waiting here right.'
p5306
aS'From Amanda Megan Miller  Bridesmaids donning soft green dresses, a long family style farm table for the head table with rustic chic centerpieces of candles, moss, and tree bark, and votive candles lining the exposed brick walls of their reception, there is so much pretty in Pilar and Blake s wedding! Not to mention, these two truly have the most beautiful love between them. Gentle and sweet, that anyone can see in the way that they look at each other. From their touching ceremony and perfect first dance to Hey Ho by the Lumineers at their candlelit Gallery 1028 Reception to the beautiful coming together of their families and let s not forget the unstoppable dance party at their reception, their day was perfect!\n'

Well, she captured it all to a perfect T. Have a look at this pretty farm affair in the gallery right here!'

aS'From Jenna at j Elizabeth Photography  This wedding was a dream come true. From perfect 72 degree weather to the bride and groom so honestly in love, everything was perfect. A real life wedding, made from scratch, in the middle of nowhere IL, and it was stunning. The bride and bridesmaids got ready on top of the barn where the reception would be held. A little garden was set up with chairs for guests, a table for pretty details and a rug for the B & G to stand on. Everything about this day felt like they were your family too. During the ceremony we even got a surprise, that the little flower girl had to go potty and NOW. Kids are so unpredictable and this time it was just the right moment. The ceremony was flawless and followed by fabulous bridal party photos where the simple pale pink bridesmaids dresses add just enough color to the images. The reception started with a first dance and cake cutting on the table with a tutu skirt. The couple ended the night with lanterns on an almost dark sky, it was incredible.\n'

S'This wedding is proof that elegance and simplicity never go out of style   at least in our book. And it s proof that when you mesh a classic color palette, romantic details and a restored warehouse reception venue   you re left with a day that s both untraditional and timeless all wrapped into one. Anna Page is to thank for the oh-so-pretty photos, and you can feast your eyes on every moment right over here.'

aS'From the Bride  Charlie and I have known each other since middle school, I even had a crush on him then; but he was more focused on sports than girls. So it wasn t until the summer of our junior year of high school that our relationship began. My parents invited Charlie s family up to our lake home in Elkhart Lake, WI. It was a day of boating, sun activities and enjoying meals but Charlie and I managed to spend almost the entire day getting to know each other down at the beach. Fast forward 8 years, and on that same beach 4th of July weekend, Charlie proposed.'
p5395
aS'We both knew from the start that we wanted something unique for our wedding; which is why when we first stepped foot into the Historic Pritzlaff building nestled in the Milwaukee s Third Ward we instantly fell in love with this venue. We loved that this restored warehouse, adorning infamous Milwaukee Cream City brick, was a blank slate and a space we could truly make our own. The Pritzlaff is so unique and provided the vintage, rustic and urban feel we were looking for.'
p5396
aS'Our wedding day was perfect   it was a beautiful and breezy summer day. Downtown Milwaukee was bustling with 4th of July Weekend festivities and we were surrounded by an abundance of our family and friends.'
p5397
aS'Our bridal party looked amazing. The bridesmaids were outfitted in soft blush chiffon J. Crew dresses that were flowy and feminine. The dresses were accented with nude heels and Stella and Dot earrings. The guys were outrageously handsome in Vera Wang Black Tuxedos with crisp white shirts and shiny black patent leather shoes. All the attendants looked elegant yet comfortable for a day of radiance and dancing!'
p5398
aS'Our ceremony was held at the beautiful Old Saint Mary Church in downtown Milwaukee. It was the same church where Charlie s parents were married 27 years ago. We were so blessed to have my childhood priest and dear family friend as the celebrant. He gave the message that marriage was a lot like dancing and that it will be unique to each of us. He encouraged us and all our guests to dance their way through life. Our guests took his message to heart and we all danced the night away   Charlie and I were thrilled to see the dance floor packed the entire night!'
p5399
aS'One of my favorite memories from our wedding day was our first look. We were overwhelmed with excitement and emotion and Anna Page captured it perfectly. It brings tears to my eyes just reminiscing about sharing that moment with Charlie. Both sets of our parents just happened to witness this exact moment side-by-side. Again, Anna captured their expressive looks of love and contentment. This memory will forever be etched in my mind'
p5400
aS'Many people told me to take some time during the wedding day to reflect and live in the moment. We did just that. While guests were being seated we quickly escaped to the rooftop of the Pritzlaff building and enjoyed some of the best views of the city both of us call home. It was a beautiful and peaceful moment and one that I will always treasure.'
p5401
aS'We worked with Shully s Cuisine to create one of the most spectacular meals we have ever had. Dinners in our households were an experience and that is what we wanted for our wedding. The evening started off with a fabulous outdoor cocktail hour with a spread of various meats, Wisconsin cheeses and oyster shooters (my dad s favorite!). Our Tuscan themed dinner cuisine was served family style creating a relaxed and fun atmosphere for all. The dishes were served in waves, starting with a fresh Italian summer salad followed by roasted pork loin, shrimp arrabbiata, chicken marsala, sweet summer pea risotto and roasted vegetable pasta stacks. Guests were able to have it all! Not to mention our decadent red velvet cake by The Cake Lady, served alongside an array of petite desserts. For a late night treat we served an assortment of pizza from our favorite college pizza place   Ian s Pizza.'

aS'Our wedding day was better than I could have ever imagined. We are so thankful for the vendors who helped make our wedding day perfect and are so blessed to have shared this day with the people we love most.\n'

S'A few years back, I visited Mackinac Island and instantly fell in love with the old world charm. It s the loveliest little spot for a handmade wedding, and that s exactly what we ve got on the agenda this fine Thursday morn . Justine Montigny snapped every DIYed detail, and there s lots more to be swooned right over here!'
p5430
aS'From the Bride  Nathaneal and I are currently living in Australia working as missionaries with the organization Youth With A Mission (YWAM). We came home to the US to plan the wedding and get married. I am from Washington State and Nate is from Michigan. We chose Mackinac Island as our destination because Nate spent his summers vacationing in Northern Michigan in Mackinac.'
p5431
aS'The island will forever hold sentimental value and it was a dream to get married there. The island is set apart by its  no car policy.  Your only means of getting around is by horse carriage or bicycle, which brought such character to our wedding. Having our guests take ferry boats and carriages to our ceremony added quite a unique experience. We booked our venue after falling in love with the lush  woodland grotto  ceremony site at The Inn at Stonceliffe. We wanted to have a small, intimate wedding, very woodsy with lots of greens and hints of gold   a real organic feel. So an outdoor ceremony tucked back in the woods was perfect. Because we opted for a small wedding we wanted to spend every moment we could with our guests who had made the trip up. So Nate and I chose to have a  first look  and pictures before the ceremony. We found a GORGEOUS look out point called  Sunset Rock  with a beautiful view of Lake Michigan and the Mackinac Island Bridge. It was a perfect moment filled with excitement, anticipation, tears and joy!'
p5432
aS'I am a lover of all things handmade and  Do It Yourself.  I couldn t jump on Pinterest fast enough to get the creative juices flowing. For the stationery, one of the groomsmen and bridesmaid helped me put my ideas into an actual design and we had them printed at Office Max. With the stationary I wanted to incorporate all things Mackinac Island such as bicycles, horse carriages and the Mackinac Island Bridge. I bought all the flowers locally and my mother-in-law put them together. Our ceremony decor was quite simple because we didn t want to take way from the beauty of the Woodland Grotto. I bought a pine tree Christmas wreathe, bent the wire into a heart shape, and covered it with seeded eucalyptus and white berries. I am obsessed with all things wood and it played a big part in our wedding decor. I really wanted each guest to have a cutting board as a place mat and take-home wedding favour, but on our budget we didn t know if we could afford it. While still in Australia I found some at IKEA for $4 each! I was on the phone with different US IKEA s to see if they carried them and turns out only the Asia/Pacific stores did. So what did I do? I bought 40 cutting boards and filled one of my checked bags weighting over 50 pounds and brought them home!'
p5433
aS'Living in Australia and being from two different states we had guests come from all over the world. We wanted our guestbook to reflect that, so we bought a scratch map and asked our guest to scratch and sign where they were from. It was so cool to see it fill up all over different places in the world. One of my favourite things about the wedding was our dessert table and all the goodies. We wanted to support Michigan locals so we had fresh Michigan cherries, blackberries and fudge   all delicious things Northern Michigan and Mackinac Island are known for!'
p5434
aS'All in all our day turned out more perfect then we could imagine and I wouldn t change a thing. My advice for all brides is don t sweat the small stuff   when you look back on the happiest day of your life, you ll realize it s all small stuff.\n'

S'When Christy Tyler Photography sent this pretty in pink soiree our way, we knew it was something special. Aside from our favorite hue, the day boasts a love that is the signature of every SMP wedding. Beautiful and warm, the love took center stage.'
p5518
aS'From the stunning bride  When Dan and I first started planning our wedding, we quickly figured out what was most important to us: to be surrounded by our family and friends and to be able to treat our guests to a memorable night. The first one was easy. Our wedding party included our siblings, brother and sister-in-laws, cousins, friends and Dans two nieces. Although it was the size of a small army, it was an amazing feeling to have such a special group of people standing by our sides on such an important day.'
p5519
aS'When we started looking for the perfect reception venue, one thing we knew was that we didn t want our guests to have to travel too far from the ceremony to the reception. We would be married in my church so that definitely helped us narrow our search for a venue pretty easily. When we first walked in to Independence Grove, we knew that would be it. Not only was it a five-minute drive from the church, but it also had the elegant, comfortable feeling we were looking for.'
p5520
aS'After discovering that the floor to ceiling windows in the reception space would be lined with candles, the rest of our design elements really just fell in to place. We wanted a simple, yet romantic feeling so candles were going to be paramount and adding mercury glass to pick up the reflection of the candlelight was a no-brainer.'
p5521
aS'The florist created centerpieces that were chic and coordinated with all of our bouquets, and the bakery kept things simple with our four-tier stucco-style cake. Our guests raved about their meal and the flash mob our families coordinated was the perfect way to kick off our reception.'
p5522
aS'Our wedding day was more than we could have ever dreamed. It encompassed everything we were hoping for and was the perfect combination of elegance and fun (with a lot of emphasis on the fun!).\n'

S'There s really no denying it: traditional weddings rock.  They rock sooo much, in fact, that spending our day with this beautiful Chicago affair?  Best day ever.  Because this is the kind of classic soiree that takes your breath away with lush blooms from Colin Collete, one seriously adorable bride and groom and crazy chic pink and blue hues.  Dive into all of the pretty captured by Jacqui Cole right here.'
p5566
aS'From Jacqui Cole Photography  Grace and Jeff met at the very end of their final year at DePaul University. If that isn t fate, then I m not sure what is.  They grouped together for a class project and Jeff knew instantly that this beautiful, outgoing girl would eventually be his. And that she was! Grace asked for elegant, timeless and romantic and this wedding at the Hyatt Regency O Hare was all of the above and more. Getting wed at St. Vincent DePaul Church under the magnificent altar, to sneaking away in Lincoln Park for portraits and the stunning details at the Hyatt Regency   Grace and Jeff s day was nothing short of perfection. One of the sweetest couples I have ever had the pleasure of getting to know, Grace and Jeff deserve the love and happiness they so clearly bring to each other. With family and friends coming from all across the globe to celebrate their love it was a day to remember. I am so SO happy for you both and wish you a lifetime of love together!'
p5567
aS'From the Bride  Jeff and I met in a computer class in college. He helped me with my class project and I quickly learned what a kind heart he has. Shortly after we were happily dating.  After two years, Jeff proposed on a rainy Sunday in October. Nine months later we were married at our college church, St. Vincent DePaul. We were so fortunate to be surrounded by so many family and friends. It was such a lovely day, I wish we could do it over and over again.'

S'This wedding is full of little moments that have stolen my heart. Tucked in little corners everywhere you really start to see the love that went into planning the details of this beautiful wedding from Christina G Photography. Top of my list? The bows on the bridesmaids  shoes!'
p5616
aS'From the beautiful bride  Chris and I have known each other since first grade and grew up down the street from one another. It was not until eigth grade when Chris asked me out over instant messenger for the first time but our love for each other matured as we grew older. As a couple that grew up together, shared the same teachers and overcame similar challenges, we wanted our wedding to reflect the history we have had together and the people in our lives that are most important to us, our close friends and family. After Chris proposed in May of 2012, it was a no brainer for us to have our wedding ceremony at our grade school church, Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Glenview and the reception at Michigan Shores Club in Wilmette where we used to bowl, swim and hang out together as children.'
p5617
aS'Chris and I wanted our wedding to be traditional with a fun twist. We wanted to treat our guests to a night they would never forget. We took a lot of time making sure that every aspect of the wedding had an unpredictable addition from the seersucker bow ties and monogrammed cummerbunds for the groomsmen to the bows on the back of the bridesmaids  shoes to the choreographed first dance and bow ties on the escort cards! Our wedding was everything we had hoped it would be. We could not have asked for a better day/night!\n'

S'The Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum set the scene for this oh-so-lovely brunch wedding, and before you even think of diving head first into this gallery of pretty captured by T&S Hughes Photography and planned by Anticipation Events, let me just tell you it s a certified pretty-fest. With an easy elegance and sooo much love, this post is one fine way to start your Friday. See it all here.'
p5656
aS'From Anticipation Events Megan + Parker were married at Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum in May. They had a Memorial Day weekend brunch wedding in Chicago, which if you re as obsessed with mimosas and Bloody Mary s as we are, then you know we were a match made in wedding heaven. We rehearsed in their downtown apartment and then they went off to dinner and caught a show at Chicago s beloved Second City.'
p5657
aS'Sunday morning, Megan got up really early to get ready so luckily she had some serious help from their adorable daughter Olivia. Megan + Parker chose not to see each other before the wedding, but they did say hello before walking down the aisle. T&S Hughes Photography and I set them up on either end of a door outside the museum so they could squeeze hands quickly and calm each others  nerves before we lined them up and sent them down the aisle to say  i do!  We took care of some incredibly charming details inside: vintage rentals, board games and chalkboards made this brunch casual, but still oh so sophisticated.'
p5658
aS'The dessert table got some extra special attention. Megan used to work at Milwaukee Cupcake Company so her old boss brought cupcakes down especially for the wedding. We supplemented with loads of popcorn, cookies, doughnuts and candy. Seriously, their guests had brunch and then a boatload of dessert? Genius! I loved working on this brunch wedding with Megan + Parker and celebrating with their family and friends. They were so kind, grateful and easy to be around and for all of the vendors it was a fun twist on the typical dinner reception.\n'
