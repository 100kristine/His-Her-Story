S'This adorable duo s love story stretches all the way from San Francisco to Sydney and all it takes is one look at the beautiful imagery from Closer To Love Photography to know that no matter the distance, they were meant to find one another. With just a short couple of months to plan their wedding, the rustic-elegant result is jaw dropping to say the least!'
p54
aS'From Closer To Love Photography  Tamara and Tim (also referred to as TimTam) met through a dating website and conversed for a year and half before officially meeting in person in Australia. Tamara is from Sydney, Australia and Tim from San Francisco, which often times made their courtship difficult due to distance, but they kept in touch via phone calls and Skype. They looked forward to reuniting time and time again in Australia and TimTam made the most of every opportunity whenever they were on the same side of the planet. Ultimately, their attraction for each other s values, honesty and off-beat humor won both of them over and Tim would soon ask Tamara to be his beautiful bride! Having only 2 1/2 months to pull their entire Wedding Day off due to immigration terms, TimTam succeeded at planning and creating an inviting, intimate and homey Wedding at the Rengstorff House in Mountain View, California! Surrounded by dear ones from near and afar, their Wedding Day was filled with so much joy, laughter and endless love from all that were present.'
p55
aS'From the beautiful Bride We feel incredibly blessed and grateful to have found each other from such a distance. Foremost, our Wedding Day details were inspired by the joy of merging our two wonderful families and cultures together (Australia and USA). Our families were over the moon to come together from both sides of the world in celebration. Planning & styling all wedding details ourselves was a fun, creative, and crazy challenge! We set the basics via long-distance, yet had only 2 1/2 months to pull our wedding together following immigration terms, when I arrived permanently in San Francisco. After an exhaustive search of wedding / engagement ring designs, Tim decided to custom design our rings to capture the unique style and characteristics that we envisioned. Lorraine from Derco Fine Jewelers was so helpful, and had them produced just-in-time. I am still amazed that Tim created such beautiful keepsakes, under such pressured circumstances. Our wedding theme began with the words  rustic garden elegance  and ended in a happy mix of decor & a fabulously eclectic selection of music. We aimed to create an atmosphere of fresh, relaxed elegance for our guests and Rengstorff House provided just the right ambiance. It was stately yet inviting, intimate and homely. The lovely gardens also complimented Tim s passion for gardening. Air plants and succulents are among our favorite plants, so it felt natural that we should integrate them as our guest favors and alongside floral arrangements. We incorporated little Australian details into our stationery & table ornamentation to commemorate my relocation and pay homage to dear absent friends & family who could not be with us at such limited notice. Additionally, our names are Tim and Tam. There was a prevailing unspoken -and spoken!- expectation that we serve TimTam s on our big day- A favorite Australian biscuit (US translation: TimTam  cookies ). We obliged by featuring every available flavor on our dessert table! My family arrived just in time to save my sanity in preparation. Tim likes to refer to his home during this two week period as a  Pinterest Sweatshop . Friends and family honored us endlessly in their offers to contribute their time and talents to our day. We were absolutely thrilled to have them involved as MC, Photo Booth Operator, Videographer, Day-of Coordinator, Welcomers, Helpers, Heavy-Lifters, Log Choppers, Thrifting Decor Sourcers, Amazing Crafters, and Upscaling Spray Painters! They truly made our day special, and we left smiling from ear to ear. '

S'I adore all the weddings we feature on SMP, but sometimes a wedding like this one come across my screen and really plays with my heart strings. Beautifully designed by the super talented Sweet Emilia Jane and seen through the lovely lens of Rebecca Fishman for Birds Of A Feather, after one look at this gallery you ll know exactly why I m head over heels for ever moment of this wedding. '
p109
aS'To capture the Spanish seaside village style, I chose a white on white color palette for the long, family-style dinner tables and classically European, dark wooden bistro chairs. Heavy white plates and silver place settings lent a refined rustic feel. The table glowed with brass lanterns and dripping candlesticks, while the pool and every stairway was lined by tall white votives. White round bulb string lights hung over the dinner and dancing areas.'
p110
aS'Travel has formed a huge part of both Dan s and my lives, from trips with family and friends to studying and living abroad. Mallorca is a crossroads between cultures, so to create that global feeling, we decorated the lounge areas with Moroccan tea glasses, African stools, colorful pillows from Greece, wooden Spanish benches, painted Moroccan tables and clay water pitchers from Portugal. As a nod to my family s ties to Mexico, papel picado wedding banners floated above our guests as they arrived. Almost every decorative item came out of our and my parents  homes, reflecting years of traveling and collecting.'
p111
aS'I knew day one that I didn t want floral arrangements   that the greenery we used would come from my parents  garden. Our ceremony took place under my parents  pergola covered in grape vines and our guests sat among four olive trees. Potted lavender and dwarf orange trees lined the ceremony aisle, olive branches ran down the dinner tables and sprigs of rosemary attached the escort cards to a Moroccan iron screen. Yellow roses, my grandmother s favorite flower, served as accents. I carried a bouquet of daisies, my birth flower. And a single clementine sat on each guest s plate at dinner   a detail I picked up from photos of a Mallorcan wedding I found.'
p112
aS'We had no wedding parties; our immediate families walked down the aisle with us while flamenco guitarists played. My godfather married us as we stood on a Moroccan rug in a nontraditional ceremony that drew from wedding customs around the world. We wrote and recited our own vows. Our programs described the symbolism of each visual choice and ceremonial element. One of the most memorable moments came when our family members stood and gave us their personal blessings.'
p113
aS'Glasses of cava with lavender sprigs welcomed the guests pre-ceremony, so they could immediately get into the party spirit. Large metal tubs overflowed with Old Speckled Hen, the first drink Dan and I ever shared together. At cocktail hour, while the guitarists continued playing, we served signature beverages named after where we met (The Village Idiot, made of bourbon and cherry bitters for Dan) and where we got engaged (Hollywood Forever, a mezcal and citrus concoction for me).'
p114
aS'To keep things casual and intimate, we knew we wanted to do family-style sharing for dinner. The meal started with a plated salad of arugula with stone fruit and burrata. Then came salmon with lentils, hanger steak with a shallot wine sauce, chili-flake broccolini and the most amazing  smashed  potatoes ever. Passed appetizers at cocktail hour included risotto balls, goat cheese and fig tarts and ahi tuna tacos. The bread was from one of our favorite restaurants, Tavern. And we meticulously tasted and chose the Spanish wines together.'
p115
aS'When the lights went down, our ceremony space transformed into a fire pit, encircled by traditional Mexican leather chairs and fixings for s mores. Across the pool, we projected drinking and dancing clips from classic movies, edited by our DJ company. The music rocked and we were so glad we picked a DJ over a band   it definitely created the perfect party atmosphere. On the dance floor, Dan s and my  80s and  90s favorites mixed seamlessly with old standards and current hits. Guests of all ages filled the dance floor nonstop.'
p116
aS'We cut the cake once again under the pergola, which now sheltered the most incredible dessert table ever, lit up by dozens of candles. Star-shaped lanterns hung above. Our main cake was carrot with buttercream frosting, decorated elegantly with sprigs of lavender. It was flanked by five smaller chocolate bundt cakes, a recipe that came from my mother, and is one of our family traditions.'
p117
aS'When we finally had to turn the music off, the guests who still had energy moved to an after-party in a room overlooking the pool. Guests lounged together on floor pillows and poufs, enjoying midnight snacks: french fries, grilled cheese sandwiches and Mexican wedding cookies. I surprised Dan with a platter of his favorite: gourmet pigs in a blanket   which I had once sworn I would never, ever serve at my wedding!\n'

p156
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Since the age of 15, I have looked through wedding magazine after wedding magazine trying to imagine to what my perfect day would consist of. I have always dreamed about having a fairytale wedding. I wanted to have a wedding that was soft, classic, and romantic. I used several resources for inspiration such as pintrest, wedding magazines, and past wedding albums from previous weddings. I created a collage of colors, flowers, themes, and then present this to my wedding planner Kerri Hatter of LVL Event who then guided me in a direction that could fulfill this vision. I owe my gratitude to my wedding planner, and florist/designer Larrissa Rehder for carrying out my vision and dream of my perfect fairytale wedding. My favorite memories of the day were, the ceremony, walking down the aisle and seeing my husband for the first time! And the ambiance and decor topped off the evening, it was truly a dream come true.'
p157
aS'The biggest piece of advice that I would offer to current brides is not to stress about the small things and to ASK FOR HELP! For me I wanted the day to go perfect and I felt I had to do everything on my own which resulted in a melt down! and The realization that I had a team and family members that I trusted and were there to help with the process and create the perfect day for me.\n'

S'There is nothing quite like a garden wedding. The magic is in the natural open air setting and the feel of an intimate backyard affair   hence why it s one of our most popular genres. And all of those elements layered in with a handful of fab vendors including calligraphy by MM Ink, florals by Pink Petals and loads of pretty images by Onelove Photography truly makes for a stunning celebration.'
p204
aS'We wanted a small and intimate wedding that would give us a chance to share our favorite things about Carmel with our loved ones. We planned a welcome dinner for everyone at our favorite restaurant in town (Christopher s Restaurant), where they serve the most delicious fried green heirloom tomatoes that are locally picked. We spent the weekend enjoying the area, hiking, and relaxing in the sun with our friends. I even had a chance to catch a yoga class one morning, so we really felt relaxed by the time the big day rolled around.'
p205
aS'On the wedding day, we wanted our guests to feel comfortable and at home, as if we were inviting them to a garden wedding in our own back yard. Hanging tea lights, scattered candles, our favorite books, and family portraits and pictures of us growing up decorated the ceremony site where we exchanges vows. The sun was setting over the mountains and wineries in the background, which made the occasion feel like a dream. Eric loves the sounds of violins, so we knew a string trio would provide the perfect music for the occasion. We picked our favorite songs, which were mostly a combination of jazz, Brazilian music, and classic rock songs by The Beatles, Billy Joel, Elton John, etc. You would be surprised how beautiful Led Zeppelin can sound on a violin!'
p206
aS'At the reception, we wanted to treat everyone to our favorite foods; charcuterie, seared halibut, and delicious local wines that Eric selected. We filled the space with large couches, comfy pillows, blankets, and a fire pit to keep everybody warm and cozy as they enjoyed the evening. For desert, we had marzipan-layered cake and  Bem Casados  which are individually wrapped Brazilian treats that are meant to bring luck to the newly married couple.'
p207
aS'Sarah Pink was a wonderful florist to work with. I showed her endless pictures of French gardens and told her I wanted our wedding to look and feel like that. She made the vision come to life with delicate peonies and garden roses. For center pieces, we used milk glass and teacups, since I love traditional tea parties and I collect vintage teacups. Sarah also built a beautiful Chuppah for us, which is the canopy under which a couple gets married in a Jewish wedding. It is meant to represent the home that they will build together, and it is open on all sides so that family and friends will always be welcome.'
p208
aS'Directly after the ceremony, Eric and I snuck away for some alone time before meeting up with our guests for the reception. They had set up a picnic table in the organic vegetable garden for us with a sampling of our appetizers and two glasses of champagne. We watched the sunset together and toasted to our new marriage. We were even visited by a family of four deer who came right up to us. It was such a special moment.\n'

p257
aS'From the Bride  We wanted our day to reflect the love we have for each other and our family and friends. Most importantly, we wanted it to be fun! We fell in love with the Beltane Ranch in Sonoma the moment we saw it. The quaint yellow house was the perfect backdrop and the views during sunset were absolutely breathtaking! We weren t sure where to start but thankfully we found Rosemary and Leslie. They guided us every step of the way and the day was more beautiful than we could have ever imagined. They helped us transform the ranch into the most elegant setting for our special day. '

aS'Walking down the aisle with my dad while the string quartet played my favorite song  Falling Slowly , exchanging the vows we wrote to each other, the stunning candlelit bar, our beautiful table settings and flowers, our first dance as husband and wife, walking around the ranch during sunset to take pictures, Jackson s delivery of ice cream sandwiches -Blake s favorite   and dancing under the stars all night on a packed dance floor are some of our favorite memories of a day packed with incredible moments!'

Because not only is it absolutely stunning, it seems to attract equally stunning couples like these two cuties below. Their elopement captured by Jasmine Lee Photography is one for the books, and is yet another reason why I ll always adore city hall elopements.'
p288
aS'My bouquet added the perfect touch to our pictures. Because I am not from the San Francisco area, I relied on an emailed photograph of my desired bouquet that I had found on Pinterest to the florist at Not Just Flowers. When the bouquet arrived at my hotel the morning of the wedding, I was astonished at how perfect it was. The huge, pale-pink Dahlias and warm burgundy astilbe gave the bouquet the delicate look I was going for. Because Devin and I wanted the day to be romantic, we wanted our pictures to reflect that. We chose Baker Beach as our second location for photographs so that we could capture the beauty of the ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge in our photos. We were a bit nervous because of the gusty winds that day, but to our amazement, Jasmine worked her magic and captured extraordinary photos that the wind ended up complimenting. When we received our photographs, we were in awe. Everything about our wedding day was exactly how we dreamed of it to be: romantic, sweet, simple, and surrounded by those who are closest to our hearts.\n'

S'I m always a little jealous of California s year round sunshine. It offers up the perfect weather for an al fresco affair, even in the Fall. And Beaulieu Garden couldn t be a more stunning backdrop with it s garden finery and canopy of twinkling lights. It s made even more so at the hands of Atelier Joya, Stacy McCain Event Planning and loads of pretty images by Elle Jae. Click here for even more.'

aS'From The Bride I had no idea Morgan was going to propose. It was the morning of my grandmothers birthday and we got up early to take our bulldog, Dexter for a hike along the beach in Half Moon Bay. We were supposed to be at parents house for an early bbq that afternoon to celebrate my grandmother s birthday. Dexter loves the water and the beach and was dragging me towards the water and Morgan was walking very slowly behind us. I finally stopped to ask him if he was feeling ok and he had already taken the ring box out of his pocket. He asked me if I would marry him and Dexter and I laughed and said yes. He asked me again if I was sure and I said yes. He said  good, because all of our friends and family are going to be at your parents today to celebrate . Turns out, I was the only one who didn t know he was proposing. That afternoon was so much fun because it ended up being a surprise engagement party with our closest friends and family  .'
p366
aS'When Morgan and I got engaged, we both immediately knew that we wanted to be married in the Napa Valley. We wanted to invite our family and friends to not only celebrate with us on our wedding day but spend the weekend with us and enjoy all that Napa has to offer.'
p367
aS'Our weekend began at the Andaz Hotel, located downtown Napa, surrounded by restaurants, shopping and the Napa river all within walking distance. Our family and friends were greeted with a goodie bag and map of downtown with places to see and visit during their stay. We wanted to spend as much time as we could visiting with everyone who traveled to celebrate so we had an open cocktail party instead of a rehearsal dinner on the patio at the Andaz.'
p368
aS'The day of the wedding, our guests were shuttled to Beaulieu Gardens, a private estate located in Rutherford. We chose this venue for its obvious beauty and with its many different gardens, we were able to move the party from one area to another, creating a  roaming party  feel.'
p369
aS'The overall theme or aesthetic of our ceremony and reception was a natural-rustic Napa feel with pops of glam. Farm wood tables with sequin runners and mercury glass, hanging tea lights from over head, just made everything look so rich glamorous without taking away the already beautiful landscape from the venue. It was perfect clear fall evening and we had placed throws on all the ladies chairs for them incase they got chilly. We wanted everyone to feel like they were included and had the best seat in the house so we had couches and lounge areas set up near the reception area and dance floor to give it a more intimate feeling. Instead of a guest book, we had photo album on one of the coffee tables for everyone to sign and write messages in. That was fun for us to read though the next day.'
p370
aS'We still wanted it to be fun and personal and at the end of evening, we wanted our friends and family to leave thinking that it was the best party ever. We chose Pop Rocks as our band because we loved their energy and we wanted everyone to dance. We had late night snacks passed for guests during the last hour of dancing to keep the party going. At the end of the evening, our guests were shuttled back to the hotel and we invited all of our guests who weren t ready to go to bed yet, to join us after hours for some sushi and cocktails next.\n'

S'When it comes to weddings, I m all about keeping things cozy. And that s the very route this Cali couple took with just 75 guests on the list. Joji Rose brought the  big family dinner  vision to life, and Onelove Photography was on the scene to snap every second. Happy swooning!'
p480
aS'From the Bride  Our wedding was an intimate gathering of 75 people, and our wedding guests witnessed us profess our vows to each other at the Old Mission Rey De Espana Church in Mission Hills, on a perfect California winter day. Following our ceremony, we headed at Westlake Village Inn, where we had our venue in the Vintage Room. We feel so incredibly blessed not only to just be married to each other, but that we got to share our day with the people that we love. We also wanted to make sure our family and friends had a good time.'
p481
aS'When we were planning our day, we wanted it to feel like a big family dinner. We wanted to be relaxed and not obligated to a wedding day timeline or tradition. We decided to keep our guest list small and everything else really simple and intimate, and we wouldn t have changed a thing! We wanted to create a vintage rustic, and ethereal feel, and we felt like it really didn t need a whole lot of decoration.'
p482
aS'One of the most important decisions was our photographer, since that is who captures the precious moments and general feel of your day for you to look at for a lifetime. We spent weeks researching until finding my perfect fit. Choosing a venue that included everything so that I didn t have to worry about the other details made a huge difference. Our special thanks and gratitude to my mom, Joji Rose who designed the event and arranged our floral design together with the rest of the family and our coordinator Korina Banks. Our wedding day turned out absolutely perfect and we couldn t be happier!\n'

And the Darlington House is as pretty as it gets. One look at the stunning Rose Garden captured by heidi-o-photo in this romantic fete, and I think you ll agree. See the rest of this beautiful day in the gallery!'
p522
aS'From heidi-o-photo  Christine and Ryan are so sweet. They re kind and loving, and fun and adventurous. They have a long history together. They met in Kindergarten, Christine was friends with Ryan s sister, and their families became friends, but going to separate high schools they lost touch. But at a family Christmas party in  06 they met again, exchanged numbers and have been inseparable ever since!'
p523
aS'Ryan and Christine s wedding was such a lovely event. Christine s mother collected all the beautiful decor items- vases, lanterns and more that decorated the ceremony and reception. The soft pastel color palette of their outfits and florals fit perfectly with the Darlington House.'
p524
aS'They partly chose the Darlington House so they could serve Ryan s legendary margaritas- one of his talents is mixology. The Darlington House also has ecclectic global architecture and decor, which represents their love of travel.'

Because time after time they craft affairs that are all at once elegant and classic yet have that certain wild beauty we just can t seem to get enough of. Now couple that with blooms by Brown Paper Design and magic making imagery by Our Labor Of Love plus a film by Sharkpig that will rock your socks off and you have this beauty in a nutshell.'
p614
aS'Our reception was held in the ruins of an old winery   an open air but enclosed space with cobblestone walls enveloped in ivy. The reception decor took its cues from the deep burgundy tone of wine. Bash Please handcrafted wine-dyed table runners and a matching Smilebooth backdrop, as well as wine-dipped escort cards with navy calligraphy. To keep things from being too stuffy, they designed calligraphed Kraft menu bands that encircled the napkins. And as a play on the surroundings, the table numbers were displayed on cobblestone and calligraphed leaves served as place cards. Hand-drawn leaves inspired by our custom invitations also adorned the signage displayed throughout. Brown Paper Design created breathtakingly lush, wild arrangements of garden roses, dahlias, and antique hydrangea interspersed with local plums, cherries, and grapes. Brown Paper also hand-dyed just the bottoms of the oversized cream, curtain panels that served as our makeshift doors for the reception space. Dinner was served family style to encourage interaction and skewed toward what was in season and locally grown (with some of our favorites, including churros and affogato instead of a wedding cake for desert). We nixed the traditional activities and kept only the toasts and first dance, which we had secretly choreographed, but never in a million years thought we d be able to pull off. Surprisingly, it was so much fun and, among such dear family and friends, felt completely natural. We ll always cherish sharing wine country with our loved ones (most of whom had never visited before) and especially hearing about all of their travels up and down the West Coast and forays into San Francisco. At our wedding, a friend of ours told us it reminded her of A Midsummer Night s Dream. That description feels right in a lot of ways, but mostly because marrying Brad and having the people we love fly out to Cali to witness it all was, in fact, a dream I d had since Brad and I first fell in love. I was elated and very lucky to have seen it realized in such spectacular fashion. We re forever in debt to all of the folks who made it possible.\n'

S'The epitome of glamour, this gorgeous Santa Barbara wedding will blow your mind.  Think I m being a bit hyperbolic?  I m not.  Because this, my friends, is what happens when sophisticated details join forces with lush florals from Toast, a fabulous Gucci gown and a breathtaking El Encanto setting.  See every awe-inspiring moment captured by Rebecca Fishman for Birds Of A Feather in the full gallery.'
p653
aS'From the Bride  I own my own boutique PR firm, JZPR, and Kris is a footwear designer. Introduced by a mutual friend at a charity gala, we had our first date two days later and have been inseparable ever since   quite the whirlwind romance! Since we re both longtime Santa Barbara residents, we chose to be married at the newly restored El Encanto, an early 20th-century hotel that is quintessentially Santa Barbara and exudes the romantic and glamorous vibe we were looking for.'
p654
aS'I chose not to wear a traditional wedding dress, instead finding a show-stopping Gucci evening gown that made me feel like a glamorous movie star of old. I wore Manolo Blahnik heels and a combination of Erickson Beamon jewels mixed with my mother s heirloom pieces. Kris looked dashing in a Tom Ford tuxedo, shoes by Prada, and hook + ALBERT accessories.'
p655
aS'We kept things very small with a private, family only ceremony that took place on the terrace of El Encanto s Oak Tree Suite (which prior to the recent renovation was called the Presidential Suite, named for President Franklin Roosevelt after he stayed there). Immediately following the ceremony we welcomed the rest of our guests at the property s storied Arbor, where we toasted around the lily pond with delicious Bellinis. From there, the party moved to an upstairs terrace where we enjoyed cocktails, dinner and dancing, soaking in the sweeping view of the Pacific Ocean and the twinkling lights of Santa Barbara below. The unexpected surprise visitor of the evening was the Super Moon that we watched rise over the town, casting an enchanted glow upon the night  An omen of good things to come, for sure! '

aS'From The Bride Malibu is very special to us!. Matt and I met while studying at Pepperdine University. So when this Texas girl started planning our wedding, Malibu was the perfect choice. We were immediately drawn to the Adamson House with its historical Spanish charm and panoramic ocean views. We wanted our guests to experience the incredibly beautiful ocean view at sunset as the backdrop for our vows. The reception site was our own secret garden where we celebrated under a gigantic sycamore tree. Although this if often the site of wedding ceremonies, it was the perfect place for our guests to enjoy the family-style southern cuisine and dance under the stars.'
p709
aS'My rose gold engagement ring and blush wedding gown, which of course, I picked before making any other decisions, help inspire the romantic theme with gold, champagne, and blush hues. Once we confirmed our venue, we started to work on a logo that would reflect a romantic spanish style. A family friend helped us create our logo that was inspired by the Adamson House architecture and the use of tiles throughout the house. Our florist used a mixture of peonies and garden roses with a touch of succulents for the bouquets, aisle lanterns, Jan Barboglio candelabra pieces and reception table arrangements. During the cocktail hour, guests could tour the historic home. Each guests received a personalized, hand painted tile with logo and their table number. Our guests dined on fine china placed on wood plank tables with lace runners and layered with multiple floral arrangements and lots of candles. The ombre butter cream wedding cake was adorned with flowers and sat on a rustic wood cake stand that was handcrafted by my grandfather.'
p710
aS'Family is a very important part our life. My grandfather was the officiant of the ceremony. My other grandfather gave and blessing and prayer and my brother read a scripture. Music is an integral part of my family. It was a special moment when my cousin, Cary Pierce, of Jackopierce, sang several original songs during the ceremony. After the toasting at the reception, my family stood and sang  The Lord Bless You and Keep You . This is a family tradition that is sung at all family weddings.\n'

aS'From Mirelle Carmichael Photography  Michel and Jeff flew in from New Zealand for a beautiful destination wedding in the Mariposa forest, where Michel spent her summers as a child. There was so much thought put into every detail of their wedding day, from the event design and florals from the bride s mother, to the perfect music chosen by the bride s sister Allie, who is a radio DJ in San Diego. They had 60 of their closest friends and family from around the world there to celebrate with them. One of my favorite parts of the day was when we hiked through fields of wildflowers and into the forest to visit a giant oak tree that Michel used to play at as a child.\n'

S'We feature a fair share of weddings at Dos Pueblos Ranch, each one just as stunning as the last. But this one, folks, is a family affair. The bride s family owns the property, and together with the help of Lauren Kendle Events and lots and DIY details, they put on one show stopper of a wedding. So even if you can t feel the California sun, Whitney Turner Photography captured a whole gallery to bask in. Enjoy!'
p867
aS'From the Bride  Getting married on my family s ranch (Dos Pueblos Ranch), where we live and my husband Teddy works, has been a dream since I grew up there as a little girl. And what made our wedding day even more special was the fact that it was such a group effort and DIY event with the help of our amazing friends, family and the coordinator Kendle, from Lauren Kendle Events. She was a true life saver! I feel so grateful that everyone was such a huge part of our day. Right from the early stages of planning, we knew we wanted to make sure that it wasn t just a wedding, but a day that really represented us as a couple, and one that celebrated the ranch that I grew up on. Truly every detail and every vendor we chose had a connection with us. Our great friend and unbelievable artist, Katie Kramer, designed our wedding invitations with hand painted details of avocados and palm trees to represent the ranch. Our photographer Whitney turner, a very talented wedding photographer, was an easy choice, not just because she is our friend but also because we knew she would make us feel comfortable. Upon a recommendation from a friend, Nico from NLC productions did our flowers, and I knew he would be great the second I met him! He really blew it out of the park and worked with me on incorporating all those little  ranch style  details I wanted. Many of the details came from things we found on the ranch, such as the hawk and owl feathers used for my bouquet and the guys  boutonnieres, the lavender, and the abalone shells that served as place cards. My brother-in-law built an insane driftwood arch that Nico helped adorn with hanging orchids so dreamy. A jewelry designer from Santa Barbara, Marit Rae, who is a also a friend, made incredible crystal necklaces for the bridesmaids and matching crystal bracelets for my mother, mother-in-law, and flower girl.   During the ceremony, my cousin Max played a couple of Allman Brothers songs on his acoustic guitar, which was another important detail for us because my husband is big into music. The dance floor was hopping because of music from the band,   The Rawhides , who were a huge hit, as well as music from our friend Josh Hartley, who DJ ed the cocktail hour and provided dinner music. Josh was another easy choice since he understood our taste so well. Another easy choice was choosing Country Catering in Goleta. We had a menu of tri-tip, chicken, salad, and veggies, which is our food of choice when friends come over for a BBQ at our house. The whole venue was incredible, largely because of Bella Vista Lighting. They completely transformed the beach, making it look so beautiful and romantic with lighting over the ocean so the waves could be seen at night. In addition, a suspended chandelier hung between two palm trees and was beautiful. Apart from the vendors, we also did a lot of things ourselves. Teddy built a reclaimed wood bar from wood on the ranch, and an awesome tree stump cake stand. I made a giant driftwood heart that turned out to be a great photo op for guests. I strung an abalone shelled garland for the cocktail hour and hand painted signs to direct the guest traffic on the ranch from ceremony to reception. One of my favorite parts were the stamped blankets with the crest from our wedding invitation, which was an awesome idea from a friend. We feel so lucky that we were able to pull off such an incredible day. The ranch is such a special place to us, making it easy and fun to create the wedding we dreamed of, but we really couldn t have done it without the help of our family and friends.\n'

aS'From The Bride Brian and I both knew we wanted to get married in the San Francisco Bay Area, and after looking in the city and wine country, we knew that Viansa was the place. The setting there was just gorgeous and the staff, especially our coordinator Cortney, took care of everything perfectly. Brian grew up in Sonoma, so it meant a lot to us to have our wedding in his hometown, close to his family. Our ceremony was outside in the courtyard, and then we moved up to the terrace for cocktail hour, and finished with dinner and dancing in the tent. We loved bringing the bright colors of orange and yellow into our flowers, table settings, and other touches to add some whimsy to the wedding. We also added some personal touches to the ceremony, with our custom vows and a special yoga blessing at the end. We went with mini cupcakes and ice cream cones for dessert vs a traditional wedding cake, and my mom added a family recipe of lemon cookies to top it off.\n'

I mean, with floral design by Adornments Flowers & Finery, stationary and calligraphy from Laura Hooper Calligraphy, linens from La Tavola Fine Linen and rentals Casa De Perrin - you simply just can t help but spend your day drifting off to dreamland with all this pretty dancing in your head.'
p951
aS'We embraced the classic elegance of the Chateau in designing a shoot that was romantic, feminine, and altogether luxurious. Our palette consisted of creamy ivories and whites, pale pink, and precious metal accents. The tabletop s foundation was a stunning new fabric from La Tavola Linen featuring a beautifully  in-between  metallic color that is a cross between gold and silver. The subtle texture added a bit of edge and interest to an otherwise traditional look. Casa de Perrin set the table to perfection with gold and blush Florentine chargers, white china and pink glass salad plates, cut crystal glassware and champagne coupes and their extravagant 24-karat gold flatware. Graceful pink goblets added the perfect blush of color and tied in the silk dupioni napkins and florals. Placesettings were graced with lovely gold-foil printed menus from Laura Hooper Calligraphy, sophisticated in their simplicity. A bit of vintage floral trim brought the entire setting together.'
p952
aS'Laurel from Adornments Flowers & Finery created refined drama with a tall centerpiece perched on an heirloom vessel in shades of bone and gold. I loved the artistic detail on the vase, from its gilded feet to the filigree designs. Gently curving French tulips and garden roses spilled lavishly over the vase s bowl, along with loose vines and greenery for a garden-inspired feel. Additional fragrant blooms were placed in small gold julep cups. The movement in the arrangement made the tabletop a bit more accessible, despite all of the luxe details. I think it s important to set a table that wows a guest but doesn t alienate them.'
p953
aS'Our models were real-life couples dressed in Kirstie Kelly gowns and Express grey suites, respectively. I especially loved the bride s voluminous skirt and tie-shoulder details. A setting like the Chateau necessitates a glorious couture gown! The bouquets were composed of the same scrumptious garden roses in varying shades of palest pink, peach and buttery yellow. Long trailing ribbons completed the ladylike look.'
p954
aS'Allyson Magda captured every detail beautifully! It was such a pleasure working with this team of creatives in reviving a bit of classic romance, and I think we were able to bring a bit of freshness to a traditional look.\n'

S'If I had to pick a top ten for fave wedding details, lace would most definitely make the cut. From classic affairs to vintage soirees, it s a romantic touch that works across the board. And this beauty from Closer To Love Photography, is adorned in head to toe with the loveliest of lace detailing. From the Bride s stunning dress and the DIY doily candles to the lace-edged invites and cake dressed in sugary lace. It s all so swoon-worthy and it s sitting pretty right here.'
p1012
aS'From Closer To Love Photography  Today we are sending over a beautifully quaint, romantic, and vintage-inspired SoCal Wedding that we had the honor of photographing at the Twin Oaks House and Garden Estate recently. The bride and groom s hearts are beautiful, and that beauty radiated throughout their entire Wedding Day. From their emotional vows made to one another, to the warm support of close family and friends, Sasha and Jason s Big Day was simply perfect. Accompanied by vibrant and colorful floral displays, and unique vintage decor throughout, we believe that you will fall in love with this timeless Wedding as much as we have! We will allow Sasha to describe the inspiration behind her Wedding Day  '
p1013
aS'From the beautiful Bride  The inspiration behind our Wedding Day first stemmed from my love of Stars Hollow, the fictional small town in the TV show  Gilmore Girls.  I wanted something with a quaint, homey feel that was more reminiscent of the northeast rather than southern CA gardens, trees, and flowers rather than beaches and Spanish architecture. I wanted a romantic garden fairytale full of twinkle lights. I combined the garden small town idea with my love of 40s music to come up with a vintage garden wedding. I saw an idea for candleholders made of lace doilies on Pinterest and my theme of lace and doilies was born. Most of my ideas came from wedding magazines (which is how we found the venue), Pinterest, and Etsy along with suggestions from my coordinator.\n'

aS'From The Bride I feel that Anthony and I are the epitome of  what s meant to be will be , and that theme shined through on our wedding day. We fell in love with our gorgeous beachfront venue, so we decided to take on the challenge of planning our wedding in just four months in order to secure our dream location. With the help of the amazing team at Before I Do Events and all of our incredible vendors, it proved to be no challenge at all, and everything easily fell into place just perfectly as it was meant to be, for the big day.'
p1068
aS'We wanted our wedding to be classic with romantic hints of vintage, and Parisian-inspired touches throughout. Most of all, we wanted the wedding to be  us . From the wood planks that lined the aisle with the things we love about each other (how Anthony proposed), to our personally written vows, to our family-style dinner from one of our favorite restaurants, to our basketball themed grand entrance (yes, my husband dunked in his tux), to our delicious dessert bar   it was a night centered around everything we love, including each other and our dearest friends and family.'
p1069
aS'Love and genuineness filled the room, and we had a blast dancing the night away. We also made it a point to take some time out together to take it all in, which was great since time flew by. After the party ended and Anthony and I got back to our hotel, and we did an impromptu photo shoot on the beach, and we then found ourselves playing ping pong in our wedding clothes (then maybe or maybe not headed to Jack in the Box). It was the best, most perfect night because it was just so  US .\n'

S'When it comes right down to it, blush tones always steal my heart. But this lovely garden soiree from Heidi-o-photo? The blush palette stands for sooo much more. From the bridesmaids dresses and the Bride s brother donning a pink suit to the florals and linens, blush was a symbol of strength and hope for this Groom and his beautiful Bride, who had been diagnosed with breast cancer twice in the last two years. Not only is this garden soiree romantic-as-ever, but it shines with the most beautiful love.'
p1095
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Trevor and I first met when I was on vacation in Laguna Beach, California in March of 2009. Right away, I could tell he was sincere, and I knew he was an overall  good guy . We hit it off from the first minute we met. I flew back to Austin, Texas with stars of hope in my eyes. We kept in contact and took turns traveling to see one another in a whirlwind romance. Five months later, I trusted my instincts and moved to southern California to be with him. Five years later, here we are happily married!'
p1096
aS'After getting engaged in April of 2012, I researched several different venues near and far that would best represent our partnership. We both enjoy being outdoors and our favorite seasons are spring and summer. I have always dreamed of getting married in an intimate garden filled with beautiful flowers. After being engaged for 2 months we stumbled upon Twin Oaks Garden Estate, and our springtime wedding was officially in the works. Both of our lucky numbers is 4, so it was a complete coincidence that the ONLY available date that fit both of our schedules was April 4, 2014. We both agreed it was meant to be!'
p1097
aS'We couldn t have asked for a more perfect wedding. It was definitely a family affair! Many amazing details of the wedding were made possible by our family members. My talented mother created all the centerpieces and floral. My creative father is responsible for building some of the props, including our own customized corn-hole game. My brother helped assemble each centerpiece and was there for support in any way possible for my parents and me of course! Together, they created a magical scene! Yes, they drove an 18-foot trailer from San Marcos, Texas carrying most of the d cor and supplies, not to mention the beautiful cake that was made by Simon Lee Bakery (The cake was still fresh and AMAZING thanks to a special cooler made by my dad.).'
p1098
aS'Trevor s charismatic uncle was our officiant and added some much needed comic relief when our nerves set in. He is the brother of Trevor s late father, who passed when Trevor was a toddler. Having him take part in our special day meant the world to both of his family and us.'
p1099
aS'As for the details, my favorite was definitely the  memory table  in which we displayed wedding photos of our parents and grandparents. Some are no longer with us, but they all hold a very special place in our hearts. Our cake topper is another sentimental detail. It has been in my family for about 100 years and will continue to be passed down to future generations. Most of all, we enjoyed celebrating and sharing our special day with our closest friends and family.'
p1100
aS'We chose the main color to be blush as it holds a very special meaning to the both of us. In March 2012, and again in February 2014, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. From the blush roses, to blush peonies, to the blush bridesmaid dresses. My brother even wore a custom made Gatsby-inspired pink suit in honor of my fight. For Trevor and I, this wedding was a symbol of strength, hope, and lifetime of good health for our wonderful families and dear friends.\n'

S'Backyard weddings are one of our favorite genres. They re personalized and cozy and dripping in laid back elegance. And if that backyard happens to be mere feet from the ocean, consider it a whole new level of awesome. This photo shoot is oceanfront beauty paired with chic modern details and the idea of a casual beach house get together. Conceptualized and crafted by Lavender & Twine, Cassidy Rae Events and These Bud s A Blooming, these images will have you rethinking that backyard affair and maybe moving it seaside.'
p1138
aS'From Lavender & Twine The inspiration for this modern and romantic shoot was sparked by an incredible tiled wall a wall accenting a one of a kind modern beach house. We wanted to help couples think outside of the box, and inspire a fresh take on a modern beach wedding. With a mixed palette of neutrals, greens, and whites with pops of oranges and gold, this is the perfect combination for a modern yet elegant wedding.'
p1139
aS'The stunning floral arrangements were provided by These Buds A Blooming. Allie put something together more gorgeous than I ever imagined. I mean, did you see that bouquet?! The soft textures in the arrangements combined with the edginess of the succulents and pops of color are a perfect fit with this modern vibe.'

S'If a classic Tuscan vibe makes your heart sing, but you don t want to make your guests trek to Italy for your Big Day, might I suggest this lovely inspiration from Katie Jackson? Set at The Gardens At Los Robles Greens, every inch is a Tuscan-loving dream. Fiore Beauty prettied up the Bride with a bold, bright red lip, Petals Floral Design loaded every corner with striking florals and One Smart Cookie Catering set the table with mouth-watering treats galore. See so much more here.'
p1181
aS'From Katie Jackson Photography  The Gardens is an all outdoor brand new wedding site at the Los Robles Greens Golf Course. It opened about 6 months ago. We styled this shoot to complement the Tuscan decor of the venue. We wanted to take away all of the gimicky signs and just have beautiful deserts and the most beautiful flowers. Less is more. The flowers used for the bouquet are to die for. They include peonies, ranunculus and anemones. The coffee beans and other greenery add a little twist on the all-white bouquet.'
p1182
aS'We also highlighted some very unique deserts (all made by One Smart Cookie Catering) including the following: Pistachio & Vanilla Bean Cheesecake with Pistachio Brittle, Lemon Basil Shortbread Cookies with Fresh Lemon Thyme, Baklava Cupcakes with Honey Buttercream and a Caramelized Hazelnut. We wanted to use some different types of desserts (more than just macaroons and cakes or mini pies) to inspire brides to think out of the box when it comes to their desserts.'
p1183
aS'The groom is also dressed for a summer wedding in an ALL BLACK LINEN suit! It still looks very upscale but is much cooler than a wool suit. Such a great option for a summer groom! We need to think about them too! Fiore Beauty also gave our bride an awesome bright red lip to add a little punch to her look. All of our stationery was created using paper goods from Paper Source and then just printed on a regular printer. It s DIY but it looks soooo good.'

S'I m sending a little shout out to all the DIY brides out there today, particularly this stunning Bride. In the midst of planning my own wedding, going the DIY route sounds appealing, but it s a ton of work! So when I see it pulled off oh-so-beautifully in this mountain fete from Candice Benjamin, I say kudos to this lovely lady for glamming up a vintage chandelier, crafting a gilded LOVE sign, wrapping over 200 votives in lace and gold and so much more. Don t miss the sweet film from Cloud 9 Cinematography!'
p1224
aS'From the beautiful Bride We were engaged November 2012, and shortly after we drove out to see a venue that I had fallen in love with online, called Serendipity Garden Weddings. It was located at the top of the San Bernardino Mountains, in Oak Glen, CA. I was nervous and excited, I was hoping it was as beautiful in person as it was in pictures. To my surprise, it was even more beautiful in person. Derrick and I loved everything about it, it felt perfect for us. We had never been to an outdoor wedding and we were a little nervous about what our family would think. We decided to bring them out to see it for themselves, and they fell in love with it too! They spent 3 full hours walking around the garden and they didn t want to leave, we knew then that we had their blessing. The venue was booked every weekend for 2 full years, so we decided we would have our wedding on a Thursday. We were married on a beautiful sunny day on Thursday, August 15, 2013.'
p1225
aS'I wanted a vintage wedding with a classic, romantic, feel. I love details because they personalize an event. I DIY d a large portion of our wedding, and loved every bit of the process, it allowed me to be creative again. Over the course of 8 months, I gathered ideas and began tackling each project. My first project was glamming up a vintage gold chandelier that we used as a backdrop for the ceremony. I spent 10 hours gluing crystals to it, and it was worth it. The outcome was just what I had envisioned.  It was the first of many projects and it really set the tone for the rest of the wedding.  My projects for the ceremony area included a wooden aisle sign , reserved seat signs, flower petal cones made of doilies, chalkboards made from vintage frames,  the ring bearers sign, and the flower girls basket and head piece. My brother in law surprised me by hanging crystal strands to the alter. I still remember arriving at the venue, driving up over the mountain and catching a glimpse of the chandelier and the crystals sparkling in the sunlight and swaying in the breeze, it was so beautiful.'
p1226
aS'I was inspired by a photo that Derrick and I took in front of the LOVE sign in his hometown of Philadelphia. We had lots of Derricks family and friends at the wedding and I wanted to honor his hometown. I found silver LOVE place card holders that we spray painted gold and finished off with a coat of glitter. My lovely and very creative sister Flower hand wrote each of our guests name on cardstock which we used as seating assignments. Flower also wrote our guests name on brown cardstock that we added to each of our guests wine glass using tiny clothes pins. I made a large LOVE sign out of cardboard, glitter, a vintage frame, and a chalkboard, that we placed on the outdoor fireplace. The DIY projects at the reception area also included a chalkboard menu and bar sign, bathroom signs with our baby pictures, Mod Podged ampersand sign to link our chairs together, my bridal hair piece, table numbers, and thank you cards placed in photo booth pictures sleeves. '
p1227
aS'I love candles, I purchased over 200 votive candles and wrapped half in lace and half I painted gold. They looked beautiful surrounding the gorgeous arrangement made by our wonderful florist at Flowers Ect. I provided him with lace and he wrapped each wooden box with it. I also provided our florist with lots of globe vases filled with glitter that he added small flower arrangements to. The candles, flower boxes, and glitter globes created a gorgeous runner for our long wooden tables.'
p1228
aS'We love sweets. We added mini cupcakes to our cocktail hour, and they were a hit with our guests. I stained wooden boxes and with the help of my sister Yoli, we created tiny chalkboard signs to label each flavor. I surprised Derrick with a Grooms cake in the shape of a large pink Homer Donut. He loved it, and it was really yummy too! Cucamonga Cakery did an amazing job.'
p1229
aS'The most memorable portions of the wedding included waiting at the top of the hill right before the start of the ceremony in the horse in carriage and looking down at all our guests, seeing Derrick as I walked down the aisle, my mother daughter dance, Derrick being thrown into the air by my cousins, our first dance, and our human tunnel grand exit.'
p1230
aS'Our wedding truly felt like a fairytale. We were surrounded by so much love, it was the most beautiful day of our lives. I couldn t have asked for a more perfect day. We are so grateful for the outpouring of support from family and friends and to our amazing photographer Candice for capturing these precious memories that we will cherish for the rest of our lives.\n'

All together, it makes for one gorgeous affair shot by Katie Shuler Photography with a film by 618 Studios. See it all right here.'

This Ojai affair photographed by Michael Costa most certainly falls under the latter. And it comes baring floral gifts by Flowerwild and the most elegant details crafted by Jill La Fleur.

It s crazy gorgeous stylings coordinated by SmittenKiss meets the yummiest of treats from The Sweet Event meets ones of the most stunning bouquets you will ever lay your eyes upon from Vo Floral Design (seriously).  Throw in the softest of blush and pink hues and it s basically the epitome of pretty.  See it all captured beautifully by Avec L amour Photography right here.'
p1384
aS'From Avec L amour Photography  Nestled in the hills of Los Altos, California are fields of lush greenery and a landmark filled with history and education. This place is called Hidden Villa. It s enough to be an isolated wilderness with farm life but not isolated enough to be far away from civilian life. I had the honor of coordinating this  Pretty in Pink  shoot of which was the collaboration of several talented souls. As wedding connoisseurs, we were inspired by the freshness of spring blossoms and its beauty of new life. As the design process took place, it unraveled into something quite breathtaking.'
p1385
aS'As the 5pm sunlight peeked through the branches, it set the perfect lighting for our evening shoot. Our bride was dressed in Clare La Faye; we couldn t have picked a more perfect setting for this beautiful gown. Her designs represent our favorite old Hollywood glamour with the softest edge one can imagine. As she stood in the olive orchard, her hand swiftly moved past the floral arrangements that were strategically placed on the table. Tea time and strawberry macarons were on the menu. The design was magnificent. The florals, the ribbons blowing in the warm breeze, and the sweet smell of salted caramelized treats from Sweet Events softened the rustic hardware.'
p1386
aS' As Avec L amour snapped away, we could hear the roosters bellowing their cluck; we all couldn t help but be captivated at how perfect everything was. As the evening wore on, we were sure that something delightful and charming was just created. This is exactly what happens when you have the right minds working together to build a picturesque moment. Some moments you take right in, and that is what happened with  Pretty in Pink .'

aS'From The Bride As soon as James and I got engaged, we agreed on the one major detail of our wedding   that it would be a mini-vacation for all who attended. With this in mind, we set forth to find the perfect church as we felt that our marriage would be the cornerstone for our intimate wedding. We drove up the Pacific Coast, stopping in Malibu and Santa Barbara before having our breath taken away by the majestic beauty and tradition of the Carmel Mission and the city of Carmel. From that point on, we knew that we wanted Bash, Please to help us make our dream weekend a reality after having attended and being captivated by their creative mindset at their wildly popular Cream Event. Upon meeting Melissa and later Sydney, we imparted our desire to make every detail of our wedding weekend, bespoke.'
p1430
aS'We knew that a Fall wedding would lend itself well to all that Carmel had to offer as well as our love of hearty food, deep, rich colors, and the crispness or air that only a perfect Fall day could bring. We wanted a celebration that was unique yet approachable, where our guests felt comfortable and happy and were able to experience elements they maybe hadn t experienced before. We knew upon meeting each of the creative, talented vendors that it was a match from the start. Alise made sure that our flowers were rich, vibrant and unique (and surprised me with out of season peonies in my bouquet!). Pharmacie made sure that guests were able to partake in uniquely curated cocktails. Our photographers   Christian and Reinna, were such a dream to work with, they captured our day beautifully and made it a seamless effort. A Chef by trade, James oversaw all of the culinary details for the weekend. From the salmon tartarecones with cilantro caviar to the mini candy crab apples that circulated during the dance, it was one unforgettable meal. Steve and his team exemplified the term  a restaurant without walls.  We wanted each dining experience to truly stand out with unexpected little touches like the vintage Absinthe Cart making rounds at the rehearsal dinner to the  roomforty campfire  deconstructed s mores and mini candied crab apples passed during our first dance. The private residence we selected for our celebration overlooked the Ocean. We knew that our guests would drive up the long and windy Point Lobos Ridge road not knowing what to expect when they got to the top.'
p1431
aS'The big reveal on our big day, was one of the best surprises of the weekend! Clouds hung low above the patio, and every guest expressed at some point  We are dining above the clouds!  Indeed we were floating in the clouds, not only then but during the entire weekend. An unforgettable marriage and wedding   indeed.\n'

aS'From Nicole Alexandra Designs  Sherry & Daniel s wedding was inspired by their love of prohibition inspired cocktails. This set the tone for the elegant and vintage touches found throughout their spectacular wedding day which took place at the Marvimon in downtown Los Angeles! The day started early as the Bride and Groom celebrated their cultures in a traditional tea ceremony. Following the tea ceremony, the Bride was whisked away to the venue where she changed into her second look for the evening wedding festivities. She looked stunning in a Katie May gown and 1920 s inspired hair, make-up, and accessories, while the handsome groom donned a chic Dolce & Gabbana Tuxedo. The bouquet and boutonniere from Twig & Twine completed their lovely looks. Inside, the reception was filled with elegance and a romantic ambiance. Cut glass bud vases filled with a colorful array of garden roses, ranunculus, and anemones, lined the long wooden tables, while incredible hand selected vintage plates and gold flatware from Dish Wish completed each place setting. Guests found their seats after finding their hand-painted names on a vintage window paned door. Food was catered by Heirloom LA and was served family style. Cocktails were hand-crafted by Julian from Mixology, and included 3 signature drinks. Draped in pearls and garden roses, the wedding cake touched on the 1920 s theme   it was almost too pretty to eat! After some serious dancing, guests were treated with some late night tacos from the Mexicali Food Truck. The entire day was beautiful and filled with fun loving moments. The love shared between Sherry & Daniel was palpable and reminded us all of what true love looks like! '

S'Do me a favor: before you do anything else re: this beautiful wedding, read the description below. Seriously  before you dive into the gorgeous images from Athena Kalindi, before you fall in love with the stunning gown from Nicole Miller and before your jaw drops over the breathtaking backdrop that is Yosemite, read the story of how two people wouldn t let anything (and I mean anything) stop them from tying the knot in one of the world s most gorgeous locales.  It s truly, truly inspiring.  See it all here.'
p1521
aS'From Athena Kalindi Photography  This New York City couple planned a destination wedding in Yosemite with only 12 people in attendance. The government shut down, but the couple still came to California (they were supposed to get married at the Ahwahnee Hotel) and the hotel offered for them to move the wedding to the Tenaya Lodge outside of the park. With hope the park may open, the couple stayed at the Tenaya and waited until October 13th  with no movement from the government, the park was still closed. The couple decided to get dressed and attempt a park wedding anyhow! We said we were moving through to cross the park, but once inside the rangers sort of looked the other way while we spent hours alone in the vast and immense beauty of Yosemite (including being the only people at The Ahwahnee!)! After a few hours of portraits, we met the rest of the wedding party along the side of the road and conducted the ceremony. It was absolutely flawless   and the couple ended up with the wedding of their dreams.'
p1522
aS'Another super cool element to this story? Their pre   wedding story was told by many major publications including the BBC and Buzzfeed. They were grouped with some other couples who told stories about how the Government closure had affected their wedding plans. '

S'From the Valentinos to the perfect ballerina bun, this Bride has mad style and it rings true for her wedding day as well. It s an affair wrapped in sunshine and a gorgeous backyard setting ripe with bright blooms by Molly Ryan Floral and the kind of photographs we could literally stare at all day long. See all those gems and more captured by Laura Gordon Photography right here.'
p1574
aS'From The Bride I always say  it all started  with the bright indigo J. Crew sweater that Bronzon wore on an auspicious day in May 2010 because it caught my eye from a mile away. We met during the summer before our last year of college and started dating almost immediately. As those days of languor ended, we parted ways to finish college   Bronzon at UC Berkeley and I at University of Southern California. Even during the first months of long-distance dating, our lives moved in serendipitous lock step, which made it so much easier for us (and our love) to grow and mature together. Long story short, we both found jobs in the Bay Area (that even started on the same day). Then, the very same thing happened with our next jobs! After some time of both living and working in the heart of downtown San Francisco, in October 2013, we got engaged during a horseback ride on a sunny day in the thick of the Marin woodlands.'
p1575
aS'A May 3, 2014 wedding date put us on a 6-month timeline, so the planning process quickly commenced. I discovered that the modern bride s challenge is comprised largely of the limitless options she has to choose from. One choice that was easy to make for both of us, from the beginning, was the venue   Bronzon s parents  home. The Tudor style house in Bronzon s hometown of Chico, California, is nestled among lush greenery (meticulously groomed for the wedding by my father in law, who also strung lights, set up fountains, and handcrafted a tree swing, a wood block for our cake, and welcome banners for us), oak and willow trees, and best of all, a little lake with a dock   the perfect place to exchange our vows. Bronzon is the third of four siblings, the first two of whom had already been married at the house, but in different locations around the property; so, we were excited to follow this privilege of a family tradition.'
p1576
aS'The very first decision I made was that photography and videography would be priorities. I wanted to work with a fine art photographer who could express the natural beauty of our garden-like setting as well as direct romantic, editorial-style portraiture; as such, Laura Gordon was one of the first vendors we selected. Despite the fact that we did not meet until our engagement shoot days before our wedding, when she flew out from Virginia, her raw talent was evident and her infectious personality put us at ease immediately. From then on, it was like having an old friend as our photographer. Damon and Amy from Frontside Films were a dynamic duo of a husband-and-wife team whose sweet personalities and ability to work unobtrusively aligned well with our intimate family-only wedding. I fell in love with their ability to express the feeling of love through dreamy imagery.'
p1577
aS'Discovering and working with the most talented, caring, and competent vendors was one of the most rewarding components of planning the wedding, and we would emphatically recommend every single one of the vendors that are listed.'
p1578
aS'Our wedding aesthetic evolved naturally from the physical landscape and the spring flora that was to be in season. Bronzon and I are different in many ways but share an appreciation for that which is classic, and simple yet elegant. I was able to infuse my penchant for a little bit of luxe by adding in gold accents (and gemstones!) where I could. Our palette developed into an ethereal commingling of blush pink and rich, layered neutrals such as ivory and champagne. Two accent colors   the natural blue-green of dusty miller and gold from various decorative pieces   added interest. One decision I made early on was to keep the d cor simple by anchoring it with the floral design. Molly was a fantastic partner and worked with me to create a vision that involved lots of the palest peonies, ranunculus, garden roses, cymbidium orchids, and importantly, greenery, for balance and texture.'
p1579
aS'Kara, my sister-in-law, was also my day-of coordinator, artist, and calligrapher   the individual responsible for all of the beautiful directional and table signage you see, including the dinner menu on the vintage mirror from the Leen s home. Kara had this amazing ability take one look at my inspiration boards and make them come alive in a completely unique way. The watercolor style and  juicy  modern script that is repeated throughout the signage is wholly hers, and I could not have loved it any more!'
p1580
aS'Many of us would agree that mothers have a lifelong passion for nourishing us. Our mothers were no exception. When I mentioned to my mom that Bronzon and I wanted to serve a signature drink that reflected our combined tastes   a strawberry mojito mocktail   she promptly set up something like a chemistry lab in her kitchen and laboriously perfected the recipe with the help of my taste-testing dad in between the many weekly hour-and-a-half-long drives my dad and mom made to San Francisco for my dress fittings. My mother-in-law and legend of a baker, catered to every one of our dessert requests, which included not just homemade red velvet cake (complete with edible gold leaf detail) but also berry tarts, pecan tarts, and Bronzon s childhood favorite   strawberry rollup. For our guest favors, she made miniature strawberry jams.'
p1581
aS'Admittedly, when I first started learning about planning my own wedding, I didn t understand the prolific use of the phrase  labor of love.  Now, I do. I am moved to tears when I think of the role that each of our mothers, fathers, and siblings played to make our dream wedding possible. I cherish those simple moments that brought our families closer, like when our dads conducted a rigorous sweep of the lawn together and how my mom, mother-in-law, and sisters-in-law taught themselves and each other how to fold napkins a certain way, all on the morning of the big day. I am grateful to be spending the rest of my life with the best man I know, but I am also supremely grateful to have gained another set of devoted parents and a whole crew of siblings who I can love as my own. The most surprising thing that wedding planning accomplished was to play such a big role in redefining family, as I knew it.\n'

It is a cooperative of artists and since 1929, it has been a San Francisco Bay Area landmark and an inspiring sanctuary for both artists and craftsmen. Originally owned by a Spanish King in the 1700s, it was purchased by art lovers and designed in the classic Spanish Colonial Style with tile work brought over from Spain and Morocco. The entire location with its Spanish architectural details of the red-roof tiles, archways, courtyards, wrought iron and the stunning Spanish-style gardens are very picturesque, making it the perfect destination-wedding venue.'
p1619
aS'Our soft color palette of blush pink and a hint of gold was inspired by the romantic vintage details of Judy Lee s JuLee 2015 Collection with sexy, charming silhouettes. Playing with textures and colors, each dress features delicate lace, tulle, chiffon, and satin with a touch of gold or rose gold tone that shines subtly. The collection is designed for brides who are true romantics at heart yet bold and chic. They believe in tradition, but are not afraid to step outside the box and be unique. The collection reflects this daring personality in what we called  sweet and spicy. '
p1620
aS'Complementing the dresses were hand-made hair accessories by Bonnie Harper of One World Designs Bridal Jewelry, featuring materials in gold, pink and blush tones. Some of the favorite pieces of the day were the pink hair flowers, gold rhinestone hairpins with champagne pearls that matched the bride s necklace and add a little bit of sparkle to the overall theme. A few more favorites were the bridesmaid s headband and set of pearl and gold hairpins with hand painted leaves to match her dress.'
p1621
aS'Skyla Arts provided a simple  Barbie,  high ponytail for Rashmi. As for Victoria, they did one of their favorite looks, a faux bob. It is the type of look that is fabulous on just about anyone, a combination of retro and modern, and it fit the style of the short gold dress perfectly. Makeup was simple classic beauty choices that never date and always looks modern. The eyes were framed in individual lashes and the lips were glossed to suit the model s\n skintone.'
p1622
aS'The venue was the perfect place for inspiration for floral designer, Cary Li of Petals by Cary. The red tiled roof, walkways and wrought iron details sought for a rustic and sweet flower accent. Color driven by the softness of the bridal dresses; white fragrant freesia and buttercup ranunculus was a must, especially in the spring time, when they are in season. The bridal bouquet comprised of Juliet garden roses from David Austin Rose provided shades of glowing apricot as they bloomed   cupped when freshly cut and opened to form large rosettes with perfectly arranged petals which complemented the gorgeous dresses. And of course, what is not to love about the matching floral hair pieces!'
p1623
aS'Yummy and scrumptious desserts were provided by Alison Okabayashi of Pretty Please Bakeshop, which included a trio of 6-inch mini cakes   fondant frills with gold edging, gold fondant with blush and light peach sugar rosettes and white fondant with oversized dahlia in blush. Of course, the dessert spread won t be complete without the blush colored french macarons, mini rice crispy square dipped in white chocolate on a stick, mini coconut cream pies and the mini tea cakes with sugar peaches with gold leaves on top  all of which were inspired by the color and texture from the dresses.'
p1624
aS'The peony letterpress invitations with gold foil lined envelopes by Kristen Schenck Jackson of Letterpress Printables were an absolute match for the overall inspiration. The colors and textures were perfect complements to the gorgeous blush and gold linens by Napa Valley Linens.\n'

S'I was so excited to see this beauty of a wedding because it just so happens to take place in my childhood hometown; a pretty, pretty spot in California made even more so at the hands of Jose Villa. It s So Cal au naturel kicked up a few elegant notches by Brooke Keegan and Holly Flora with a wildly good looking backdrop of Cal-a-Vie. Al fresco dining never looked so good, my dears. See for yourself right here.'

p1686
aS'When we started planning our wedding a year later, Justin and I tried very hard to stay true to ourselves, we found just that at Cal-A-Vie, it was a dream destination, they hadn t done a lot of weddings but thanks to a lot of help we were able to turn it into the ideal venue. We kept things natural to highlight the beauty of the California landscape and the old French d cor of Cal-A-Vie, by filling the chapel with greenery and candles we tried to give the ceremony an intimate feeling between the two of us and our guests. And in an effort to keep the day about family, we found pictures of past generations at their weddings, giving us a great perspective on love through the ages. Throughout the day we tried to incorporate elements that would appeal to my love and pride of my Danish heritage, as a nod to that heritage we ordered mini kransekage, the traditional Danish wedding cake, as favors, and we had the guests sing along to a typical toast, which ends up being more like a roast. One of the most special elements we stumbled across was a custom monogram by Tiny Pine Press, it completely captured our spirit. As a lovely surprise Justin and I received a number of small contributions to our wedding day, including an abundance of vintage family jewelry and a traditional Danish plaque, memorializing our wedding day. Overall, with a lot of help and love we managed to plan our ideal California wedding.'
p1687
aS'Our wedding day was better than I ever could have imagined. It was filled with love happiness and excitement. It was a perfect day spent with family, friends at a wonderful venue with an amazing staff and the best band ever.\n'

p1720
aS'One cute personalized detail that made an impact: Guests walked down a pathway to the ceremony site and could read their wedding vows with every step of the way. And once they reached the ceremony site they were greeted with soft white flowers and woven fans. They also placed personal touches all throughout the venue such as a memory table for Jenae s dad, pictures of them throughout the years, favorite quotes on chalkboard signs, and their favorite signature cocktails at the bar.\n'

S'This is a wedding dreams are made of. They fairytale kind of dream. A gorgeous ceremony with sweeping coastal views, a ballroom wedding draped with gorgeous florals by Nisie s Enchanted Florist and a completely in love couple   this gallery from Victor Sizemore is what we call pinch-yourself pretty, and there is even more gorgeousness from this wedding in video form from Elysium Productions below '
p1771
aS'From The Bride The vision for the wedding was to have a beautiful and comforting feel. I wanted the wedding to feel like a getaway for people. I chose warm tones of gold and cream and I found that Pelican hill, with its beautiful wooden chandeliers and the natural scenery worked very well with my theme. The floral arrangements had a natural elegance to them, and included hanging greenery to go with the more the theme of natural and elegant.'
p1772
aS'I like that we had the view of the ocean but it was still private. The food and service were impeccable.'
p1773
aS'The ceremony was probably what made this venue so unique. The rotunda and ocean view were spectacular. My bridesmaids and the groomsmen walked to Clair de Lune, which has a really special place in both Drew and my hearts as we see it describing the beginning of our relationship. I walked down the aisle with my father. The aisle was littered with white rose pedals. Drew and I wrote our own vows and at one point he even teared up while reading them to me!!'
p1774
aS'The reception was so fun and there was a TON of food  We had lobster and steak for dinner with two delicious kinds of wedding cake to follow, a cheese course and then of course, the waffle station opened up for a late night snack (which no one needed, I m sure) we got the waffle idea because I m from Belgium and the waffles came from a client of mine, Bruxie! They were delicious. I loved the speeches that my family and drew s family gave. It was amazing to see the courage my dad showed, because he is not particularly fond of public speaking. Most of all, it was amazing having all of our family and friends together in one place and having such an amazing time together.'
p1775
aS'The wedding cake was 5 layers and had flowers cascading down. Originally we were going to do sugar flowers, but decided that real flowers would probably better reflect the idea. I got the idea from looking at some other wedding cakes and I think it went well with the natural theme.'
p1776
aS'Macaroons with gold dust were our party favors for the guests.'
p1777
aS'We honeymooned to Greece, Italy, Israel and Turkey. We went on a Silversea cruise which was amazing. Our favorite spot was Santorini'
p1778
aS'I did not want to get too confused by spending a lot of time on my wedding gown shopping, so I very quickly narrowed the search to Monique L Huillier. I initially had chosen a dress from her Bliss line, but once I tried on her couture line, I couldn t go back  I essentially had a one of a kind dress because it was a two piece gown, which a lace bodice and a satin a-line skirt with the draping that she is famous for. I bought it at the Monique L Huillier store on Melrose.'
p1779
aS'Jimmy choo shoes and veil was from BHLDN. My jewelery was all  borrowed  from my mother or grandmother, who have beautiful diamond pieces that have been in my family for years. My  new  was a beautiful pendant made by my uncle that I wore around my neck which had a picture of my sister etched into the white gold and surrounded by diamonds. My sister passed away at the young age of 21 in January 2012.'

aS'From The Bride Dan and I got married on September 2nd 2012, 11 years after we first started dating in high school. We stayed together through college, long-distance, first jobs and apartments. We grew up together and we wanted our wedding to be a celebration of that.'
p1823
aS'We wanted to get married in wine country, because even though it s only a short distance from Oakland where we re from, you can feel like you re a million miles away. We fell in love with Beaulieu Garden the first time we saw it, and knew right away that it was the place. The tree-lined drive and courtyard felt like a secret European hideaway, and dining under the arbor was the perfect combination of casual California and romantic elegance.'
p1824
aS'Most of all we wanted our wedding to feel personal, and tried to carry that through with all of the vendors we used. Our invitations, designed by Lotus & Ash (a friend from Dan s days at Stanford) were inspired by the menus at Chez Panise, the restaurant in Berkeley where we first fell in love with food. For dinner, the amazing team at Paula Leduc recreated a roast chicken with bread salad dish from Zuni Cafe, which has become our go-to spot in SF. Our table numbers were photos of Dan and I throughout the years (including an awkward prom pic which I m still not quite sure how that got in there ) Sharla Flock worked up the most beautiful arrangements in soft romantic colors that had reminded me of my grandmother s rose garden, and Yvonne Wong and the masters at Seaglass Cinema captured it all for us to look back on.'
p1825
aS'The day itself was so filled with joy, we were both grinning from ear to ear the entire time. It was everything we hoped it would be, and ended with a our guests dancing into the night.\n'

aS'In 2009, I moved to Denver for school and we did not see each other as much as we previously had, we lost touch a bit. In September 2010, on a whim, I called Jonmichael and invited him to come have dinner with me in Denver. I honestly cannot tell you what changed but the timing was right and during that dinner we both realized that our bond was stronger than previously thought and we wanted to pursue a relationship. We began seeing each other all the time and realized that it just worked between us. That following summer we moved to California for Jonmichael s new job and we have been living together in Folsom ever since with our kitty Moxie.'
p1878
aS'Jonmichael s mom, sister, and brother-in-law were visiting us in California and his family members were also meeting my parents for the first time. We had planned for a day of wine tasting in Livermore and unbeknownst to me, but known by everyone else, Jonmichael had plans of his own. We arrived at our first destination, Murietta s Well. We were tasting the fabulous wine and I remember commenting on how quickly Jonmichael was drinking his first few tastings, I know now that it was for liquid courage! Shortly after, Jonmichael pulled me aside on to the winery s balcony which over looks the vineyard. We were taking in the view and next thing I know, Jonmichael is down on one knee asking me to spend the rest of my life with him. Tears of happiness filled my eyes and I shouted,  YES!  It was an amazing memory that I am so happy our family was there to witness and share with us.\n'

S'Weddings by the sea are hands down my cure for anything. Doesn t matter the coast, as long as there s a sprawling ocean view and a spread of sand and I m one happy blogger. And if it s dressed in the prettiest nautical touches of navy and stripes like this Casa Del Mar fete from Jasmine Star, then it s sure to keep me coming back for more. See the entire shindig planned by Intertwined Events in the gallery!'
p1918
aS'From Katie Webb of Intertwined Events  A day full of cultural history and joy surrounded loved ones at Maya and Uriel s traditional Jewish wedding at Casa Del Mar. The large Ballroom was filled with family who traveled from Israel to join in the celebration. Loved ones watched in awe as the newly married couple kissed under a custom chuppah adorned in luscious florals designed by Inviting Occasions.'
p1919
aS'The bride s dress inspired the striped linens on the tables, as well as the stripes on the cake. She fell in love with the dress from a picture online and purchased it without even trying it on! His suit was custom made in a Navy fabric with a patterned liner inside the jacket. He also customized it with a little note inside saying  Mr. Right  and her dress had inscribed  Mrs. Always Right .'
p1920
aS'Before the marriage ceremony, a customary bedeking ceremony was held. Uriel and the parents signed the ketubah, a gorgeous Jewish prenuptial document that outlines the rights and responsibilities of the groom and relation to the bride. Maya welcomed every guest and said a personalized blessing for each individual.'
p1921
aS'In a beautiful twist on tradition, Maya was escorted down the aisle by both her mother and her mother-in-law! All of the ceremony elements were beyond special!'

aS'Design inspiration was based on the bride s desire for classic elegance. From deconstructed florals to an all white motif, this wedding radiated class! They had a custom gobo created for the dance floor. In lieu of a traditional guest book, the couple provided blank books at each table that also doubled as the table numbers. Guests were invited to leave well-wishes, advice for the newly married couple to read on the anniversary of the corresponding table number/year.'

aS'From The Bride Our engagement session took place in the front yard of an old abandoned house in old Escondido. Somehow during the extreme drought Southern California has felt this year, our engagement session fell on a weekend of rain. An hour before the shoot, the rain stopped and we were able to continue umbrella-free. Though my hair was not a fan of the rain, it brought a touch of the fall season that we were looking for. Fall is my fiance, Cameron, and I s favorite time of year. Our first date, the proposal and wedding have had / will have a fall backdrop and feel. There is something about enjoying the outdoors in a cozy flannel and boots. Our florist and photographer went the extra mile to say the least for our fall styled shoot. Flowers by Hilary brought our elegant, organic style into the picnic without making it too over-the-top and cheesy. She started with a warm blanket then worked her magic with creating a casual place setting complete with candles   a must for us! I was obsessed with the look of the naked cake and it tasted great too! We just love her style, she is incredible to work with. Dawn from Dawn Alexandra Photography is one of my favorite photographers! She has a fresh look in her photographs. She made Cameron and I feel completely comfortable in front of the camera which isn t easy to do. Dawn knows we love the colors of fall leaves and you can see she incorporated them nicely. Cameron and I had the best time wrapped in each other and showing our love. We hope you enjoy the photos!\n'

S'I think barrel rooms were created solely for wedding receptioning. Well, that and the whole wine storing thing but more importantly how amazing is a dinner amongst the wine?

aS'There were so many great moments during our wedding day (seeing one another for the first time, the sight of friends enjoying themselves, and most of the dances were all particularly great snapshots), but two moments really stuck out. First, despite a heat wave that shocked even die hard Californians, the ceremony was just about perfect. Sarah walking down the aisle with everyone arrayed around a perfect spot in the vineyard after a year of planning was a memory to cherish. Second, when we entered the  barrel room  for dinner, everyone was seated two long tables in a (thankfully) chilled space. Jazz was playing, our friends and family were chatting and enjoying the evening, and we were officially starting our life as a married couple. The shot had been imagined in our minds for almost a year, and it was everything we had hoped.'
p1996
aS'Three pieces of advice for planning a great wedding: (1) start using a calendar with your goals, deadlines, and details early; (2) pick people (planners, photographers, etc.) whom you trust and connect with so that you can relax about details; and (3) focus on the little pieces up front so that you relax on the big day.\n'

S'Insanely romantic tidbit of the day? This sweet couple shared their first kiss high up in the Himalayas after a group hike to Mt. Everest Base Camp. Swoon. So, it s no surprise when they made the decision to tie the knot five years later, they did it in style. With Michael & Anna Costa Photography behind the lens, this gallery is a glimpse into all the romance.'
p2042
aS'From Michael and Anna Costa Photography Dan and Lauren met in December of 2008 in Kathmandu, Nepal, where they joined the same tour group to hike to Mt. Everest Base Camp.  Dan is originally from Birmingham, England, and Lauren is originally from Bakersfield, California (but was living in Los Angeles at the time), so it seemed like fate that they both happened to travel alone to the same distant city on the same dates with the same goal. These exotic circumstances meant that Dan & Lauren s first date was kind of a group date (there were 8 other travelers on the hike, plus guides and sherpas, who were with them at all times), and it lasted for almost 12 straight days.  Instead of the traditional flowers, the first gifts that Dan gave Lauren were a piece of string to tie her solar battery charger onto the back of her backpack, and an extra roll of toilet paper, since she had been suffering from food poisoning the first week of the hike and had run low on her own supply!  Since they had no privacy amongst the group on the hike (and no showers for 9 days of the trip), all they could do was walk, talk, laugh and learn a whole lot about one another.  Although Dan didn t work up the courage to make a romantic move until almost the end of their journey, they shared their first kiss in Lukla (high up in the Himalayas), and after the pair parted ways in Kathmandu on New Years  Eve, Dan was smitten enough that he booked a trip to California and came to visit Lauren in L.A. the week after she returned home. He met her parents on that trip, then she went straight back to England 2 weeks later to meet his family, and they realized things were serious.'
p2043
aS'Over the next few years, Dan and Lauren took turns giving up their homes/lives/friends and moving overseas to keep the relationship going   Lauren first quit her law firm job in L.A. and moved to England with her dog, George, in June 2009 for almost a year, then Lauren s UK visa ran out, and in late 2010 Dan sold his electrical company in England and moved to California to try out the beach life.  After struggling with immigration issues and enduring some long gaps of time apart, they decided to get engaged and remain in California to begin their life as a married couple.'
p2044
aS'Although they were officially married in San Francisco nearly a year earlier for immigration purposes (with only the bride s friend, Cara, as a witness), the wedding celebration in Montecito was the first time Dan and Lauren s parents were able to meet one another during their 5-year romance. Dan and Lauren agreed the wedding day was magical, and a great way to bring the English and American families together. The private Montecito home where the wedding was held is owned by the bride s mother and step-father (and was completed just prior to the wedding), so the bride s mother worked tirelessly to finish up all of the landscaping and home decor in time for the big day! The home may be available to rent for weddings and other special celebrations in the future, so stay tuned!'
p2045
aS'Dan and Lauren now reside in Venice, CA, with their 2 dogs, George & Mia, where they are remodeling their new home. While he is not out training for and competing in triathlons and marathons, Dan is working on setting up a new electrical contracting company in L.A., while Lauren works as a commercial real estate lawyer for a small firm in Santa Monica.\n'

S'We ve been chomping at the bit to get this gorgeous shoot on the SMP screens, and thank heavens today is the day because I don t think I could wait a second longer. With styling and floral design from Thistle And Honey so incredibly gorgeous I could cry (if I could hug those bouquets, I would), all captured in a stunning fashion by Nicole Dianne - this gallery is simply beyond. See it all here.'
p2093
aS'I chose the Miner s Foundry for our shoot location because of the beautiful texture of the stone in the appropriately named,  Stone Hall . Nevada City is an absolutely charming little gold rush town about an hour and a half North-East of Sacramento. The facility dates back to 1855, but was destroyed in a fire in 1856, and promptly rebuilt in 1859 (is that rustic enough for ya!?). Some parts of the building have had to be retrofitted, and pieces such as the beautiful fireplace are a bit more modern (dating to 1974). In 1990 the Foundry was donated to the Nevada County Cultural Preservation Trust and renamed Miners Foundry Cultural Center; for cultural, historical, business, social and community events.'
p2094
aS'All that to say, the Stone Hall sure makes one heck of a beautiful location for a wedding. The stone makes the perfect textural, neutral backdrop and the fireplace is a stunning focal point. For the tables cape, I chose to use Dogwood s beautiful mis-matched vintage chairs to bring an air of informality to an otherwise elegant table. The linen runner on the wooden farm table also serve the same purpose. Gold rimmed glassware and vintage cutlery pair perfectly with calligraphy menus and place cards to create an understated and classic elegance.'
p2095
aS'And of course, what table would be complete without a floating ivy chandelier!? When visiting the Foundry initially, I saw the tiniest bit of ivy creeping through the old wall from the outside. This sparked my brain and thus lead to the creation of the ivy chandelier, which is a whole lot of ivy cut from my yard and wired onto a fallen branch. It was then tied to clear wire and held by two lovely assistants (read: one of the lovely owners of Dogwood and Nicole (our photographer) s husband!). If you watch closely, you can see him in the video!'

S'A day filled with a Jose Villa wedding is kind of like Christmas in July. Now take away the snow and the ugly sweaters and swap them for a stunning gown and modern gilded details and you have this San Francisco gem. It s simple, edited, laced with gold and captured in a way that only Jose Villa can do. We re calling it wildly chic with a side of pure gilded magic. See even more right here along with a film of the day captured by Imaginale below.'
p2148
aS'From The Bride Darren and I got married on a cloudy day in the beautiful city of San Francisco, Ca. From the beginning we knew that our wedding had to have several key elements: classy, yet modern, meaningful, and topped with touches of gold (of course!). First things first, we prioritized several things, photographer, venue, and city. The rest just seemed to fall into place. We chose the fabulous Jose Villa to document our special day, James Leary Flood Mansion for our venue, and the beautiful city of San Francisco as our background. Since we chose such a stunning venue, we wanted our decorations to be simple so it would highlight the beautiful architecture of the mansion. Some of our decorations included mirrors with beautiful calligraphy, vintage frames containing photos from our years together and vintage cameras from local flea markets. Both Darren and I are photographers so we thought this would be a nice personal touch. We are also fans of crafts and design so we DIY ed several things. We worked together to design a logo for our wedding. This would serve as a piece that we could include in other things to make our wedding cohesive. We designed and printed our own invitations, and added gold foil touches (which took several days to do, but totally worth it!) topped with a gold monogram wax seal. We also added gold foil to our table numbers along with some of our favorite quotes on the back side. Instead of a sign-in book for the guests, we had them sign a gold-painted globe which now nicely fits in our home as decor. Our venue wouldn t allow us to have sparklers for our  get away  and had many other restrictions so we had to get creative and made gold frills so our guests could wave as we left, worked nicely! Since Darren and I have our own photo equipment, we decided to save some money and put up our own photo booth. Our backdrop was a continuous scroll with the words from the song I walked down the aisle during the ceremony in beautiful calligraphy by Jen Halverson. I had our flowers girls (who walked with balloons instead of flowers), bible boy, and ring bearer all dolled up with Ban.do accessories! I had to! The boys had colorful poms as boutonnieres and the girls had sparkly headbands! Lastly, we re big IG fans so our wedding wouldn t have been complete with our very own instagram hashtag, #YGDbestdayever!'
p2149
aS'Some over my favorite parts of our wedding included all the music during the ceremony. We had some of our dear friends perform songs that are meaningful in our relationship. I walked down to  Most Uncommon Thing  by Five Times August (sung by Kevin Straine on the wedding day), Darren learned this song on the guitar and sang it to me on our first dating anniversary 6 years ago.  Ribbon in the Sky  by Stevie Wonder (sung by Fidi Mwero on the wedding day) was sung while Darren and I tied ribbons for our unity symbol. Towards the end of the ceremony, our pastor asked our family to form a circle around Darren and I while he prayed a blessing prayer. I can t even describe the amount of support and love we felt while being surrounded by our most loved ones. Kevin Straine returned to sing  What A Difference A Day Makes  as we were announced and walked down the aisle. Truly a difference and beyond the happiest day of my life.'
p2150
aS'I especially feel thankful and couldn t have asked for better vendors to work with! Jin Wang personally helped me chose my gown and altered it to fit like a glove! Mar from Team Hair & Make-up is seriously one of my favorite persons ever! If you ever get the chance to work with her she is amazing and will make you laugh tons! Kristi Herrmann coordinated the wedding, she is so easy to work with and chop full of amazing ideas! Lastly, I can t image what I would do without Jose Villa (photography) and Alejandra of Imaginale (videographer) on our wedding day! They made us feel completely natural and allowed us to be ourselves throughout the day. There were times when I didn t even know they were there. And the final products they produced are exquisite! I m so thankful I have these images and video to relive my wedding with!\n'

p2188
aS'From the Bride  Since our wedding was going to take place at The London West Hollywood, we wanted to create two different themes using this modern and chic venue. The theme of our engagement session took place in the garden area of the hotel which resembles an Alice in Wonderland charm. We recreated the tea party scene by having a luscious dessert table filled with  eat me  and  i do  cookies, white frosted cupcakes with mini hearts, confetti, and a splash of red and white flowers. We also wanted to incorporate the black and white chess board with the enormous chess pieces and have some playful shots. From there, we wanted to share the place we call home- and photograph ourselves on the Los Angeles 4th Street Bridge in the Arts District which is a mere 1,000 feet away from our backdoor. For this look, we wanted to create an elegant and more formal wear with a longer pale pink dress and a blazer and bow tie. As the sun was setting, we took a quick little jaunt over to the state historic park and continued capturing the warm sun setting while throwing confetti and being surrounded by love \n'

S'In wedding-land, you just can t beat the natural sunlight that shines down on SoCal. It s crisp, yet soft and oh-so-romantic. And Michael & Anna Costa always capture it so beautifully. Case in point? This sweet al fresco love fest coordinated by Felici Events. Filled to the brim with succulents, gorgeous views and smiles galore, its easy to get lost in all the pretty.'
p2226
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Hartley and I like to joke that we met through Craigslist. (Only semi-true.) One fortuitous 4th of July, I went over to my friend Scott s house to hang with him and a bunch of our friends. After a mimosa or two, out waltzes his newest Craigslist roommate, a cute guy named Hartley. I d like to say that was the beginning of our beautiful relationship, but it took some gentle cajoling from Scott and polite persistence from Hartley to get me on a real date. But one real date later, I was head-over-heels for my guy.'
p2227
aS'Three short years later, Hartley and I were married on June 22nd at Elings Park in beautiful Santa Barbara. Being from North Dakota and he from North Carolina, but both of us long-time Angelenos, we wanted to show our faraway family and friends just why we loved California so much. We wanted an outdoor venue simply because we adore the beauty of SoCal. Elings Park (Godric Grove, to be specific) was our venue from the moment we stepped foot into the park. Gorgeous views, pristine grounds, nature everywhere  it was perfect.'
p2228
aS'For our day, we knew we wanted it to be simple, we wanted it to be  us  and we wanted it to be a big ol  love fest. Anything else would be icing on the cake. The wedding turned out to be more incredible than either of us ever imagined it could be. Our fabulous coordinator, Zohe Felici (Felici Events,) made that day so very stress-free. We showed up to the venue and were wowed by all the work she and her staff had done. She took all of our simple ideas and made them beautiful. All of our vendors added something spectacular to the event: our photographer, Anna Costa, was marvelous. She got spectacular photos and didn t keep us from our guests for any longer than necessary. Our caterers, (Island View Catering,) kept the crowd happy and kept us better fed than any bride and groom in the history of weddings. Our DJ, (Music by Bonnie,) had put up with all our odd requests and handled the mood of the party from pre-ceremony through reception.'
p2229
aS'And above all else, our friends and family helped make it what it was. My long-time best friend officiated for us; Hartley s dad, an incredible musician, played a very personal guitar solo during our ceremony; we asked our aunts/uncles and god parents to stand and share some marital wisdom before we said our vows. One of Hartley s work friends who had been married at Godric Grove rented us her succulent centerpieces that she had used at her wedding, the perfect California touch. My bouquet was wrapped with Chantilly lace that my Grandmother had worn on her veil when she married my Grandfather. Hartley s dance with his mother was the best twist-ing any of us had ever seen. Our decorations consisted of photos and our RSVP postcards where our guests had drawn pictures and written poems and sweet notes. It was so full of love and had been made so easy by everyone involved, it left us able to simply enjoy every moment.'

S'This Bride had quite the challenge set out for her when she had a vision to fuse her Korean heritage, Georgia and Missouri upbringing, the Groom s lakehouse upbringing and Southern California all together for their wedding. But the result is complete perfection of them. Sprinkled with cotton bolls, desert plants, peaches and ocean blues, the imagery from Michael & Anna Costa Photography says it all. See every lovely bit here.'
p2308
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Ryan and I love to joke about the honest fact that had we met out at a bar or event, we wouldn t have ever given each other second glances. But thanks to the magic of the internet and online dating websites, Ryan and I came together while he was living in Newport Beach and I was living in San Diego but transitioning for a move back to San Francisco. I never made it to San Francisco after I took a few more than a couple of glances at him and fell in love! We spent nine months planning our wedding and tried to find the perfect way to showcase the unique combination of each of our families and backgrounds   and do it in the most fun way possible!'
p2309
aS'Ryan is blond haired and blue eyed, grew up in in the same house in Lake Arrowhead (a small mountain town in Southern California), and is the middle child in a close-knit family. On the other side of the spectrum, I m half Korean and half Caucasian, was raised by my father in the south (but lived in 10 different cities and two different countries growing up), and have just one younger brother. I had this crazy notion that I could somehow incorporate each unique quality of our upbringing into our wedding experience and thanks to our amazing vendors and the beautiful venue at the Montecito Country Club in Santa Barbara, everything came together better than I could have ever had hoped for!'
p2310
aS'We chose Santa Barbara, as it had a special meaning for us as the first place we snuck away to for a get-away while dating. The Montecito Country Club, with its laid back vibe, elegant Spanish architecture, and sprawling ocean views, was an instant and obvious choice for us. With its classic but dramatic design and setting, there was very little that I felt was needed to make it look more beautiful than it already was.'
p2311
aS'After running into some obstacles with our event coordinator, things were unexpectedly left in my hands to pull together the wedding that we had envisioned, but thanks to some very talented vendors, my  down-home  ambitions were elevated to a level far beyond what I could have hoped for! My goal was to blend Ryan s upbringing in Lake Arrowhead, my childhood in Georgia and Missouri, my Korean heritage, and our union in Southern California. I envisioned peaches, cotton bolls, desert plants, and oceanic blues   all tied together with a casual and untraditional, yet sophisticated feel. Anyone else would have called me crazy, but our floral designer, Tenley Erin Young, didn t even flinch and pulled the whole look together flawlessly with her centerpieces and floral arrangements. Tenley brought together raw cotton, fresh peaches, dainty succulents, anemones, roses and peonies in a way that can only be described as  genius.  Most everything else was DIY; I made the invitation suite myself and incorporated its design into the programs, menus, favors and other DIY decor. The favors were hand-made potted succulents that aimed to pay homage to Ryan s roots in Lake Arrowhead. I adorned them with little flags so that they could double as table cards.'
p2312
aS'TEAM Hair and Makeup did an incredible job with the hair and make-up of my ethnically diverse bridesmaids. I had fallen in love with all the TEAM features on Style Me Pretty, and I felt lucky to have them as my glamour squad that day. TEAM also made the great recommendation of Michael + Anna Costa Photography as our wedding photographers. We got a preview of working with Anna through our engagement photography shoot, and got the warm-in-the-gut feeling that we were going to be in good hands. Anna is just so into her couples and was really, truly interested in getting to know us. Thanks to that, there was nothing cookie-cutter about our photos, and she was able to capture the true elements of us, our love, and the happiness being shared between family and friends.'
p2313
aS'We wanted a quick and painless ceremony, so that our guests could get to the FUN part! Our guests were bussed in and were greeted by the live music of Trevor Zinn, a friend of ours in Orange County and a very talented acoustic guitarist. Keeping it non-traditional, the wedding party walked in to Carry Underwood s  Mama s Song,  and I walked in to Joshua Radin s  Only You.  My father is deceased, so I had the honor of being escorted down the aisle by my baby brother, Eugene. Ryan s brother, Kyle, served as the Best Man, and his sister, Lindsey, did a reading. After a wonderful ceremony officiated by Jon Ireland in front of a big bay window overlooking the Pacific, we exited to Weezer s  Island in the Sun.  Guests were then able to head out to the formal lawn area and catch the setting sun while enjoying cocktail hour and playing lawn games.'
p2314
aS'After dinner, it was time for dancing! Ryan s one specification was that we have an incredible band, and MGA Band did not disappoint. After the scheduled dances, the band kicked-off group dancing, as flip flops, tambourines, and prop instruments were brought out for the guests. The girls got down to a lip sync d rendition of Whitney Houston s  Count on Me,  which morphed into a dance off to Salt-n-Pepa s  Push It.  Being that Ryan is half Jewish, we naturally did the the Horah   but being that I am half Korean, we put our own twist on it by doing it to the tune of  Gangnam Style.  For the cutting of the cake, my mother and I changed into traditional Korean dresses, called Hanbok. I was assisted by my mom and two of her sisters during the dressing, one of which had traveled all the way from Korea to attend the festivities. It meant a lot to me to pay homage to my mom and to that side of my heritage.'
p2315
aS'The night concluded with Ryan and his fraternity brothers  shooting the boot,  a long-standing Sigma Nu traditional where the groom is forced to drink a concoction of all his friends  leftover drinks from one lucky groomsman s shoe. Looking back on the whirlwind night, Ryan and I could not be more grateful for all the work that everyone did to make this an exceptional night that celebrated our love, our family, our friends, and allowed us to stay true to ourselves.\n'

It s one part classic, one part romantic, stirred up with a bit of sweet DIY and sprinkled with the loveliest monogram detailing.

aS'From Marisa Holmes Photography  I m excited to share this DIY wedding from an amazing bride! She wanted a Classic and Romantic wedding with a little Southern Charm thrown in. She definitely accomplished that with the soft white, blush and grey color palette and personalized monogramming from her veil down to her table runners! See below for the brides point of view on her inspiration  I must say I am smitten with all the monogramming and letters!'
p2374
aS'From the beautiful Bride Travis and I started dating in High School and after 12 years we decided it was finally time to take the next step and become Mr. and Mrs. Tyson. With us being the last of our friends to get married, everyone was very excited for us and to celebrate our big day. Travis and I are very close with our families and wanted an intimate and personal wedding as much as we could with as many close friends that we have. My parents always wanted to give me a dream wedding, and it was just that.'
p2375
aS'We wanted a soft and romantic feel to the wedding and the Ponte Family Estates Winery provided the perfect atmosphere for it with soft color tones, beautiful white garden roses lining the vineyard and gorgeous crystal chandeliers in the vineyard pavilion that held our reception. Travis and I live only a few cities away from Temecula but when we go out to the vineyards we always feel like we are miles away from home. We wanted our guests to feel the same way. Many of our friends and family stayed at the vineyard the entire weekend making it a mini vacation of their own surrounding us with love and laughter the entire weekend.'
p2376
aS'Travis s Uncle conducted the ceremony that Travis and I both wrote, and he included his personal touches which included a part where each of our parents and grandparents provided us with well wishes for our future together. My mom is the most creative woman I know and the personal touches throughout the wedding were all created by my mom from the monogramming, to the signs, the thank you menus, to the favor cards. She took my vision and brought it to life.'
p2377
aS'For our first dance we had a pianist place a baby grand piano and create a special rendition of Can t Help Falling in Love With You just for us. For the rest of the night, every guest was on the dance floor dancing their hearts out. We used our playful sense of humors and provided our guests with clappers and streamer poppers to use as we left the reception to continue the celebration with our guests at Ponte Inn. It was truly the personal touches and the love from our friends and family that we will remember our day by.'

S'This is quite possibly my dream wedding. A healthy dose of glamour, a rooftop wedding at The London West Hollywood Hotel and, the best part, cupcakes before dinner. My inner 5 year old is squealing with delight. And with the help of some well versed vendors like Christine Farah Photography and Flower Allie, this white and gold glam fest was turned into one heck of a gorgeous party. '
p2419
aS'Throughout the entire planning process, we knew the color palette would be white with a touch of gold. I envisioned my bouquet to be a huge ball of white peonies and the tables to be filled with white hydrangeas and white orchids to create a fresh and clean feel. Since our reception was on the rooftop, we wanted to find just the right candleholders that would illuminate the tables and create a warm glow so our guests would feel warm and cozy as the sun began to set. We mixed and matched a variety of candle holders, plant pots, and lanterns to fill the table tops and we loved the look of the varying sizes as the light from the candles were shining through the lace pattern on the tables.'
p2420
aS' Sparkle, shine, and fun  would be the exact words to describe our wedding. One way to create the  sparkle  was renting gold sequins tablecloths and sparkly gold/white chevron table runners. Having an outdoor wedding and reception, made the tables sparkle and shine brightly! Bringing in a little bit of my Japanese culture, my mother and aunts folded one-thousand silver paper cranes and strung them on wishing trees so our guests would be able to write well wishes for us. The one thousand paper cranes were folded for good luck, health, and prosperity. These definitely added a great shine as soon as our guests arrived. Bring on the fun the one thing we absolutely loved and was truly a memorable moment was when our guests showered us with love as we walked down the aisle as husband and wife. It was literally a  shower  of love with the confetti softly floating in the sky and landing gently around us. It was one of those moments that we looked at each other, and had to take it all in because it was such an overwhelming feeling of love.'
p2421
aS' Eating dessert first  with edible escort cards gave our guest a taste of the amazing food that would be catered by Gordon Ramsey and a luscious dessert bar that overflowed with LOVE. Having  I DO  imprinted gold hearts on the cupcakes and  C  and  P  initial cookies help to personalize our dessert table to display our favorite desserts. At night, the dessert table looked completely different! The table was shining and glowing with candles which created a romantic atmosphere as we cut our cake.'
p2422
aS'The dress. My vision for my wedding dress was inspired by my mother s wedding dress over 40 years ago. She had a flowing lace veil that draped down her back and it created the most beautiful silhouette of her. I knew the style of my dress was going to be a ball gown- but with a modern twist to match our venue. Immediately walking into the boutique, this dress caught my eye. The voluminous layers, upon layers, upon layers of organza was breathtaking this was THE dress!'

S'It s funny  after all of these years working for SMP, I still find myself completely speechless.  I mean, I literally thought I had seen it all, but along comes a day like this breathtaking gem from My Bride Story and blows me completely out of the water.  Because this isn t just any wedding.  It s an epic love story meets a SURPRISE marriage celebration (even to the bride!) meets some of the most amazing images from Andy Seo Studio that you will ever see.  Get lost in all of the magic in the full gallery.'
p2460
aS'From My Bride Story  This may be, by far, the most heartwarming and intimate wedding I have ever planned in my entire career. This couple had been living together for the past 20 years. However, they never had the opportunity to wed due to difficult circumstances. The husband is now a CEO of a highly successful junior clothing line called Molly and Dolly, named after their two beautiful daughters. This family currently resides in Hong Kong, but the father decided to surprise the family with a trip to the United States AND a wedding ceremony for his wife! '
p2461
aS'I was given the privilege of planning the wedding in just six days!! From picking out venues, dresses, and shoes to putting together a romantic, organic garden tablescape, the entire planning process was definitely a treat for me. They had an intimate ceremony at Wayfayers Chapel with just the family of four and two other witnesses. Then, we headed off to a romantic candlelit dinner reception with a total of twelve guests, including the family. We chose the Mar sel restaurant at the Terranea Resort and it was a perfect reception location overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Mar sel is a fine dining that is known for their locally-sourced ingredients (citrus and herbs from the resort s grounds), so we added the maidenhair, champagne grapes, and laser cut names to tie in with our organic, garden place setting. Lavender, raspberry, blush pink, ivory and gold color palette were picked out to highlight the bride s evening gown.'
p2462
aS' This wedding was nothing short of an amazing surprise wedding I have ever witnessed. They walked down the aisle with their daughters, promising 20 more years (and counting!) of life together. I was so blessed to have witnessed their heartfelt gratitude, love and respect for each other.'

S'What happens when you re yearning for an outdoor wedding in the middle of November? You bring the outdoors in   that s what. Think moss, branches, stones and all the woodland goodness you can imagine. The result is a gallery of pin-able goodness thanks to Sara Lucero and a couple so cute you can hardly stand it. Pssst: don t miss the sweet film from Jordan Schulz below!'
p2495
aS'From Sara Lucero  Jon and Alyssa brought the woods indoors for their romantic hipster wedding. She created an enchanted atmosphere of moss, twigs, warmth, and luminescence all the while bringing a hefty amount of style and quirk.'
p2496
aS'Jon and Alyssa wanted to keep the tradition of the first look happening as she walks down the aisle, but they knew they wanted a few photos in the beautiful southern California light, so they opted for a blindfolded  first prayer  together. As a photographer I have never seen so much anticipation in one single wedding moment. I am so happy they took the time to stop, hold hands, and pray about the day that was ahead of them. The wedding day can fly by and taking these little moments to soak it all in are crucial and and incredibly sweet.'
p2497
aS'From the Bride  I took a deep gentle breathe, gripping my beautiful bouquet ever so tightly, it was a stunning November day. Everyone was now in their seats, music and the smell of love slow danced around the brick room. I stepped forward joined arms with my handsome father, he s eyes glimmered as a tear gently rolled down his cheek, side by side now we made our way up the stairs that would soon be leading up to the aisle. It had looked as if I had stepped into a enchanted forest, tall candles flickered down the aisle, moss twigs and tiny white wild flowers covered the floor. And there at the very end, stood my groom,my best friend smiling and handsome in his charcoal grey suit. It was our day, the day of a new adventure together, it was a day that two lives were becoming one.'
p2498
aS'Our wedding day. I will always hold that day close to my heart. It was everything Jonathan and I wanted. I enjoyed every part of being a bride, I loved preparing to be his bride. I loved making all my centerpieces, spray painting wine bottles I had collected over the years, finding old looking books, and picking out the perfect white flowers and willow branches that were going into the now gold wine bottles. Jonathan helped me make wood cake stands for our dessert bar. Our family was a huge help in making our wedding come together, late nights, tons of coffee & wedding magazines, to sore fingers from making sure details were just right. I couldn t thank them enough.'
p2499
aS'Would I say my wedding was themed? Yes, I had always wanted to get married in the forest, but having a wedding in the middle of November in the mountains was not the warmest idea, so I decided to bring as much forest as I could to my wedding. Branches, moss, dark greens, browns, feathers, stones, the works. I guess the beauty of the forest mountains inspired our wedding. We were beyond blessed and won t change anything about our day.\n'

aS'Alaina and Brent s destination wedding was at a private estate in Napa wine country. The inspiration for the day was rustic chic using the bride s favorite colors of light pink, grey and white. The ceremony took place by a lake lined willow trees which were hung with pink flowers. Guests dined poolside on a long farm table under a canopy of trees. Other highlights of the day included a vintage Thunderbird and cigar roller (which was a surprise gift for the father of the bride). It was a beautiful day filled with good food and wine, laughter and lots of love.\n'

S'Mint and blush will forever be a recipe for happiness here on SMP, and today s version from Michael & Anna Costa Photography might just go down in the books as one of my fave. I m enamored with the BCBG bridesmaid dresses that pair so perfectly with the Bride s Lazaro dress from JLM Couture, I adore the hints of pink rose from Bloomers Floral Design scattered throughout and did you see those pink sweetheart table chairs?! Best part? There s sooo much more in the gallery!'
p2633
aS'From the beautiful Bride  When Josh and I got engaged in the middle of winter we knew we wanted a summer wedding but didn t want to wait over a year to get married so we decided to plan a wedding in just 7 months. Thanks to our hands-on families we were able to pull it off. I wanted a small romantic intimate wedding and Josh wanted a big classic party so we chose something in between and it couldn t have turned out more perfect!'
p2634
aS'It was love at first site when we visited Lago Giuseppe Cellars. From the vineyard, to the beautiful natural reservoir, to the trees dripping in Spanish Moss, it was the perfect place to make the biggest promise of our lives in front of our family and friends. I knew with the help of my mom we could complement the natural beauty with the romantic touches I was envisioning. Once the venue was booked, myself, Josh, and both of our families hit the ground running to plan our version of an epic wedding!'
p2635
aS'Josh and I waited until the ceremony to see each other that day. The anticipation and nerves had been building all day, but the moment I saw him standing there with his eyes welled with tears all of it melted away and I wanted to sprint down the aisle into his arms (cheesy, I know!). It was such an overwhelmingly beautiful feeling. We wrote our own vows and Josh s included a portion in French   mind you he doesn t speak a word of the language! It was incredibly romantic and utterly shocking, it brought everyone to tears.'
p2636
aS'After the emotional ceremony, it was time to start celebrating! Josh and I spent hours curating a master list of songs for our guests to enjoy. One of his greatest joys in life is music, so this detail was one of the most important. We were fortunate to find a DJ that understood Josh s passion in Malik. One of the most memorable events of the evening was Malik mixing Kaskade s 2012 Coachella live set of Eyes with Ben E. Kings, Stand by Me for our first dance. This took a lot of convincing on my end but it turned out really special and our friends went crazy!'
p2637
aS'Later in the evening after a delicious dinner and epic speeches given by friends and family, we handed out glow in the dark foam sticks, light up glasses, and cute light up Minnie Mouse ears. The dance floor literally came alive! It was one of the best last minute decisions we made!'
p2638
aS'Speaking of last minute decisions, we decided two weeks before the wedding to book a videographer and photo booth. Josh went to Lake Tahoe for his bachelor party, and one night I got a phone call at 3 a.m. with him screaming into the phone,  I won money! We can get a videographer and a photo booth!!  I loved how at 3 a.m. he was thinking about how to make my dream come true. Swoon. We lucked out big time in booking Ryan from Satellite Video. We re obsessed with the video!'
p2639
aS'Our wedding day was one of the best days of our lives. There is something so special about having everyone you love there to witness you starting your journey together. I am so happy we went with Josh s desire for a big wedding. The day went off with out a hitch and I couldn t be more thankful for our kind and generous families.\n'

aS'From Desi Baytan Photography   Everything was meant to be,  so the saying goes. I m a believer in this because that was how I got started in weddings. After multiple postponements and venue changes, Tala and Samer finalized their venue at Coto de Caza. And what a lovely location it is. It has a lot of pluses. Beautiful view overlooking a valley and sits high above the ridges so there is plenty of light. But the best thing is, that all the planning and delays never phased Tala and Samer. Their faces shows what a loving couple should be. No matter the outcome. Though I have to say, everything turned out beautifully. Tala was all smiles while Samer and his groomsmen were all full of laughs. I will vividly remember their day.\n'

S'A chance encounter led to this couples  seriously fabulous love story, and ultimately to their seriously fabulous wedding. Designed to perfection by Events Of Distinction with florals from Michael Daigian Design so pretty I could cry, every image snapped up by Paco And Betty will be treasured by these two forever and ever   and you can sneak a peek of their pretty day here.'
p2747
aS'Yes she was a Yankees fan, but despite their conflicting baseball loyalties, the two struck up a most pleasant conversation, and the inconvenience from the train s delay suddenly vanished. After the train resumed and approached its destination, Craig demonstrated his hi-tech expertise by quickly inputting his contact information on Shari s laptop. Three long weeks passed by, and just as Craig was beginning to think he had struck out, Shari worked up enough nerve to call him.'
p2748
aS'The rest, as they say, is history. After a year s worth of funny flirty text messages and late-night phone calls, Shari moved to San Francisco to be with Craig. And when Craig was ready to pop the question, and he knew just where to propose   he chose a train running from San Francisco to Silicon Valley to present his sweetheart with a family heirloom diamond ring!'
p2749
aS'When Shari & Craig chose Events of Distinction to design and plan their wedding, they wanted to have a celebration that expressed their unique personalities. Once we heard the story of their railway romance, we immediately focused on the couple s train travel experiences to express the design concept.'
p2750
aS'Shari and Craig s selection of Nestldown for their wedding location was the perfect choice. A spectacular setting in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Northern California, Nestldown is a forested sanctuary that features a miniature railroad encircling its beautiful trees and gardens.'
p2751
aS'After developing a color palette of Shari s favorite orange and Craig s favorite green, grounded with a slate gray, we devised an attention-grabbing Save the Date card to get their guests on board for the festivities. We followed that up with a captivating  Wedtrak  invitation, designed to resemble a train ticket.'
p2752
aS'On the wedding day, guests arrived at Nestldown to experience a wonderland of lush landscapes and towering redwoods. An earth and wood stairway meandered down a forested hillside to the ceremony area. In this flagstone-paved setting, guests were greeted with a selection of  Mango Melody  and  Citrus Quencher  beverages.'
p2753
aS'As they gracefully descended into the ceremony area in their slate gray dresses, the bridesmaids carried hand-tied bouquets which included parrot tulips, dahlias and roses. Shari, escorted by her parents, glided magically down the rows of neatly arranged chairs, carrying a bouquet of viburnum, parrot tulips, cymbidium orchids and green ranunculus. The guitarist played one of the couple s favorite songs,  In My Life  by The Beatles, while Craig waited adoringly for his lovely bride.'
p2754
aS'The ceremony featured a special guest as the officiant. Dan Fogelman, a Hollywood screenwriter of many well-known comedic movies (including Cars, Crazy Stupid Love, Guilt Trip and Last Vegas), was a good friend of Shari since grade school. Needless to say, he delivered a hilarious yet heartwarming script about love and marriage, weaving touching stories about Shari & Craig into his  sermon. '
p2755
aS'Experiencing wedded bliss, Shari & Craig slipped away for some photos together, while guests were graciously directed to the cocktail lawn adjacent to Nestldown s  railway.  Upon arrival, guests were offered a signature  Sidecar  beverage, and two festive food  stations  provided a thematic touch. Paying tribute to Shari s New York roots, the  Grand Central  Station was designed to reflect the classic architecture of this Manhattan landmark. The  Orient Express  Station featured the couple s favorite Asian dish, Pad Thai.'
p2756
aS'After Shari & Craig completed their post-ceremony photos, they made a spectacular entrance to the cocktail hour aboard the Nestldown train. As the train whistle blew in celebration, guests gathered around the disembarking couple to offer their congratulations. The train then took guests on joyrides around the property for the remainder of the cocktail reception.'
p2757
aS'To direct guests to their dining destination, Craig used his computer smarts to create an electronic display on his big-screen TV resembling the old-fashioned  solari boards  that were once commonly found at train stations. This display listed the guests in alphabetical order, along with their assigned  Station  and  Platform  location.'
p2758
aS'Nestldown s grand meadow provided a dazzling open-air setting for a delectable dinner. Different shaped glass vases and vintage-inspired china were used to make it feel like an elegant garden party from the 1920 s. Centerpieces featured tangerine orange flowers with accents of trailing greenery and succulents. Guests savored the California Mixed Greens with orange infused cranberries, crumbled goat cheese, candied pecans. Then they were faced with a deliciously difficult choice of entr e: Seared Mustard and Truffle Rubbed Rack of Lamb, Chicken Parmesan or Butternut Squash Ravioli.'
p2759
aS'As the sun began to set behind the towering trees, guests were invited into the  Barn,  a soaring glass and fir structure. While guests munched on scrumptious sweets, Shari & Craig made another grand entrance as the 9-piece band revved up the music. It was a standing ovation for their carefully choreographed first dance! A festive dessert display provided another highlight for the celebration, while just outside the barn, a Scotch Sipping Station gave guests a good kick in the caboose.'
p2760
aS'When the last song was over, Shari & Craig were sad to see their nuptial train ride come to an end. But they were elated knowing that their friends and family had jumped aboard the  Wedtrak Express  to celebrate their wonderful journey together.\n'

And seeing as love is in many ways and earthly taste of the sublime, the whole thing is pretty perfect.  So make sure to catch all the majesty in the full gallery here.'

S'I m a firm believer that the venue sets the tone for a wedding. Whether you find your venue first or decide on a style and vision right away the venue is oh-so-important in translating the look and feel of your day. And this Santa Barbara Polo Club wedding from Michael & Anna Costa Photography couldn t be a better example. It emits elegance in such an effortless way. With Grass Roots and Events By M And M behind all the lovely touches, it s easy to see why. Hop on over to the gallery for even more!'

aS'From the beautiful Bride  Jim and I met in San Francisco in 2010 through mutual friends at a BBQ and were instantly drawn to one another. We quickly found ourselves spending all of our free time together and talking about the future. Within the year we had moved in together. A year and a half after we met, he surprised me by proposing in the rain while on my favorite hike in Marin County. Three months later, we moved to Philadelphia for Jim s job and our planning became long distance as we both wanted to wed in California (thank goodness for our planner!). Though we initially thought the wedding would take place in San Francisco, it took only one seventy-five degree April day in Santa Barbara (where Jim s parents live) to realize that it would provide the perfect indoor/outdoor venue for us. More than anything, we wanted our wedding to be a great party with family and friends. To us, this meant having a casual, yet elegant atmosphere with good food, drinks, and dancing. '
p2816
aS'The Santa Barbara Polo & Racquet Club provided the ideal back drop and required very little decoration to enhance its natural beauty, of which our florist and planner did an incredible job collaborating upon. We liked the Club s sense of tradition and simplicity, and played upon the polo theme by giving guests the option of wearing derby hats and garb. My bridesmaids wore emerald green dresses in different styles. Jim wore a navy suit, while his groomsmen wore suits in varying shades of gray with navy and white polka dotted ties. The day of our April wedding was the warmest of the year and the scenic surroundings did not disappoint. I loved that a majority of the female guests donned fascinators and that people enjoyed our signature drinks of rosemary-infused greyhounds, mint juleps and wine from a local winery featuring our own label; a wedding gift from Jim s parents. Hats off to the Polo Club as well for allowing our photographers to capture memorable one-on-one shots with a polo pony and equipment. For us, it was perfect.\n'

And when they capture a wedding like this one, with a couple as gorgeous as this one - well that s when you know you hit wedding gold.

p2848
aS'Lisa & Henrik were married on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean just as the sun was setting. The wind cooperated with us and it was so incredibly gorgeous. The decor invoked a gorgeous garden setting, and only enhanced the amazing ocean view. For the reception, guests were seated at two long tables covered with greenery, florals and candles. A fire burned behind it all and lights twinkled about their heads.'
p2849
aS'Lisa is Jewish, and the signing of the Ketubah was one of the loveliest wedding moments I ve photographed. They signed it in the bridal suite, surrounded by their families. Then, her cousin sang a piece he d written for the two of them. It was beautiful, and moved us all to tears. Henrik is from Sweden, and they brought in some Swedish traditions that I loved so very much! The seating arrangements were very traditional, in that the couple chose where each guest would be sitting. So, husbands and wives & dates were on opposite sides of the gorgeous long tables, inspiring conversation between people who don t necessarily know each other. There were fourteen speeches peppered in throughout dinner. Fourteen! People from different stages of Lisa & Henriks lives got up to speak a bit about them. It was so interesting to hear bits about each of them from so many different people.'

The warm sun-drenched day in Sonoma was just made for a celebration of love, family, food and wine. BR Cohn is a perennial favorite for us with it s genuine feel and California vibe.

S'To know me is to know that I love colorful weddings.  Vibrant orange, pink, yellow, fuchsia  you name your hue and I am totally on board.  So this lovely day planned to perfection by La Fete Weddings?  My everything.  From the rainbow of blooms created by Floral Ambiance to the rustic meets romantic Heartstone Ranch setting.  See it all captured by Priscila Valentina in the full gallery.'
p2932
aS'From the Bride  The two years of planning evolved into to the best day of our lives. It took us about five months to locate our dream venue, but the moment we stepped foot on the Heartstone Ranch property we knew it was the perfect fit for us! It had everything we were looking for from a beautiful ranch, gorgeous estate, ocean views, lush landscaping and the perfect area for both our ceremony and reception.'
p2933
aS'The dress was the second most important item on my checklist. I tried on over 100 dresses from Los Angeles to San Francisco. I finally fell in love with a Vera Wang from the 2013 Fall Collection. As soon as I saw the dress in person I knew that it was the one! They shared with me that I would be the first bride to purchase and wear the Lark gown.  It was definitely meant-to-be.'
p2934
aS'The theme of our wedding was rustic elegance. My husband was not quite sure what that meant, but our vendors sure did! We were lucky enough to have my good friend from high school, Kaitlin Kolvet from La Fete Weddings, help us plan our big day,'
p2935
aS'We took on a lot of the DIY approach when it came to d cor. Ryan created all of the wood directional signs to our wedding. My mother-in-law painted beautiful lettering and designs onto all of the chalkboard signs that we created together out of frames and mirrors. We created burlap pillows that we stenciled and painted our wedding date onto. My husband created cupcake stands out of wood stumps. I even infused tequila with jalapenos to make one of our signature spicy blood orange margaritas. We decided to use a quilt station in lieu of a guestbook along with mason jars full of Heartstone Ranch s homemade honey and jam as favors for our guests.'
p2936
aS'The wedding day could not have been more of a success! Everything I had envisioned became a reality on this day. I got to marry my favorite person on earth, the weather was unbelievable and our guests had a blast! We are very thankful to all of our friends, family, and wonderful vendors who made our dream wedding a reality!'

aS'From the beautiful Bride  Planning a wedding was tough! There were so many things we liked, and so many colors we wanted to incorporate. We knew we wanted an emphasis on birds and nature, so the color palette we chose felt soft and rustic without being too girlie. It was really important to us that our wedding felt warm, loving and intimate. Most of the wedding details and decor were hand-made by the both of us. From our wedding cake topper to our personal wedding invitations to our dinner menu, we wanted our guests to feel personally appreciated for being apart of our special day. Being the planner that I am, there was no detail that I left un-turned. It was really important our guests felt comfortable and that they were all going to have a good time. Thankfully with our venue along with our amazing vendors, we were able to have a wedding that both of us, and our families will never forget.\n'

Going through the images from Rebecca Peplinski Photography is like peeling back layer after layer of lovely.

p3034
aS'Nicole wanted our venue to be outdoors and I wanted it to be modern, but we did not know how to make our vision a reality. The Skirball Cultural Center, like everything else our coordinator recommended, managed to represent both of our visions perfectly. Architecturally modern with an outdoor space complete with a reflection pond and the Santa Monica mountains in the background, we could not have imagined a better venue. Blossom Floral (recommended by Hustle and Bustle), also managed to find the ideal style that fit both Nicole s and my tastes. I wanted a more organic feel to the flowers, and Nicole wanted a more structural arrangement. Blossom Floral created a Chuppah that was at once free flowing and still structured. She met with us numerous times to ensure we would be happy with the design, and did not leave any detail to chance. Because of the art deco theme we were aiming for, we agreed that we wanted a cake that reflected that era. Lark Cake Shop not only had the most delicious cakes we sampled, but also created a beautiful cake for us right out of the 1920s. H&B also recommended we use Theresa Huang for our make-up and hair. We could not have been happier. Theresa Huang understood the art deco look I was going for, and had enough stylists to help Nicole, me, and our bridesmaids all get ready in time for the big day. In fact, all of our bridesmaids ended up getting their make-up and hair done, despite originally planning on only doing their hair. Finally, we worked with the lovely and talented Emily Schwartz to design our save the dates (and eventually our invitations, etc.), and she perfectly encapsulated our art deco style.'
p3035
aS'I spent hours upon hours scouring Style Me Pretty, Pinterest, and everything Gatsby for inspiration.'
p3036
aS'I had no idea my partner would be SO interested in wedding planning. At first, I was floored, and mildly frustrated, as I thought I got to run the show. It was not until half-way through, when I realized our wedding would be reflecting us both, that I was so pleased. I would recommend talking to your partner about the level of involvement you will each have at the outset, and encourage him or her to be active in the decision-making process (there are so many decisions to be made!). If you are able to be on the same page throughout and work together, the end product will reflect you as a couple.'
p3037
aS'Also, it was not until we got closer to the wedding that I realized that this was not MY day. That I was beyond fortunate that so many people I cared about were able to SHARE the day with my wife and me, and I started reaching out to include and consider our friends and family as much as possible, both throughout the ceremony and the party.'
p3038
aS'Get a wedding planner (like Hustle and Bustle). Even if you want to plan the big day yourself, there are so many little issues that you won t want to deal with on your big day that a fantastic wedding planner can take care of without you even knowing about!'
p3039
aS'Finally, make sure you have a second shooter for your photos. We did not decide on one until the very end, but we are so happy we got one.'
p3040
aS'When Rabbi Miller exclaimed,  I now pronounce you spiritually and legally wed!  Not only was that the highlight of the day, but without a doubt, the best moment of my life.'
p3041
aS'When we got engaged, I did not think the Supreme Court would be taking the Prop 8 case. Just in case, we optimistically planned our date to be after the last day a decision could come down, but we were still waiting with baited breath. On June 26, 2013, SCOTUS struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, and we exhaled. That moment, when we were finally married, felt monumental. This thing that I had never even thought could happen, had just happened and I felt so incredibly thankful to everyone who had worked and fought to allow it to occur.'
p3042
aS'When I saw the chuppah, I was bowled over. Gorgeous. Rebecca from Blossom Floral did a stand-out job.'
p3043
aS'When I glanced over the railing before descending the staircase into the Taper Courtyard. I could see everyone looking at me, and I could see my wife, standing at the alter, waiting to marry me. All of the nerves and anxiety over seating charts and songs fell away. I was living in that moment, and all I felt was love.'
p3044
aS'Dancing with Nicole for the first time as my wife. Our good friend, Julia Faussone, offered to serenade us to the tune of  A Sunday Kind of Love.  With Julia s incredible voice propelling us around the dance floor, I never wanted the moment to end.\n'

S'There s no doubt that gorgeous imagery is our fuel. It s what keeps us going every day. But the stories? The stories are pure heart they transform a pretty picture into a moment. This Bacara Resort beauty from Michael & Anna Costa came to life after reading the Bride s simply sweet story of love over a 12 year span. From high school sweethearts to college, a move to the caribbean, a proposal and planning a wedding with the help of Bob Gail Special Events, you can feel the love pouring from this gallery!'
p3145
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Matthew and I met 12 years ago while in high school in Carlsbad, CA. Matthew finishing his junior year and myself a senior about to graduate and head to LA for college at Loyola Marymount University. Even though we meet at the end of high school we always call ourselves high school sweethearts because we can t remember what it was even like without one another. Both of us were born and raised in Carlsbad and attended the same junior high and high school. I was the first to admired Matthew from a distance before I finally asked a mutual friend about him; if he was single and a good guy. I think it was about a week later we had our first date and shortly thereafter we were two teenagers who were falling madly in love. One year later Matthew followed me to college at LMU. In the years that followed, throughout undergraduate school, we had some ups and downs but our life journey always brought us back to one another. Once we both graduated college we truly knew what we had and our relationship grew to an unbreakable bond. Living together in Westchester I quickly started working in Finance and Matthew was working as a Vet tech applying to Veterinary schools. After a few years he was accepted into Ross University a school in the West Indies. After many in depth conversations we decided to take the opportunity and make the big move. At first it was really hard to leave our life in Southern California; the familiarity we had built, my career and of course our family and friends but shortly after the move we realized everything was happening for a reason. We were on this once in a lifetime adventure together, meeting great friends and experiencing a different way of life. Being away and only having one another to lean on for everything our relationship grew to strongest it had ever been. We had a life together on an island in the Caribbean and it was amazing. We lived there with our two children (our dogs) and during our time there adopted two more. It was our first big adventure together and we loved what it did not only for us as individuals but together as a couple. After living in the Caribbean for a little over 2 years we finished his last year of school, his clinical year, at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. The South was a great experience but we were happy to head back to Los Angeles when the time came. As of recently we are back in beautiful Southern California. With a new and exciting outlook on life we hope to start putting down some roots soon and enjoy lifes special moments together as a family. We will forver be open to new adventures so who knows what the future may hold. Throughout all our years together and especially the last few away we have undoubtedly become stronger, wiser, more compassionate and even closer bestfriends. And above all, we truly love each other more everyday.'
p3146
aS'Matthew proposed in the fall of our second year on the island, a proposal that was totally a surprise. Something that is hard to do when you have been with someone for a decade and already very intertwined. He somehow pulled it off and caught me completely off guard and with the sweetest proposal. In true Matthew form it included animals a story about penguins and how they pick one mate for life. I was blown away not only that the whole thing was happening but by how nervous he was, it was simply so sweet. It made me giggle because after a decade I don t know how he ever thought for one second I would hesitate that yes he was so anxious to hear. It was such special day. I now had a fiance and a new journey to look forward to together all while enjoying the beautiful scenery we called home, the Carribean. After about a month of being engaged I knew it was time to start thinking about planning. The initial planning part was a little overwhelming at first, I didn t know where to begin. Mainly because I was trying to start it all from the Caribbean which meant I had to make quick trips back to California that were always a whirlwind with so much to do and see. All of which I know wouldn t have been possible without the help of our amazing families and the best girlfriends a girl could ever ask for. I remember seeing Bacara online before I saw it in person and we both fell in love. We loved that it was in Santa Barbara, a place we think of as beautiful and romantic which is a perfect backdrop for a wedding. It was luxurious and esquisite but still had that cool California coastal feel. We knew we wanted the vibe of the day to have touchs of old hollywood glam but with modern elements so as soon as I visited Bacara in person I knew it was the perfect place. Plus we knew at Bacara guests would feel like they were getting away for the weekend rather than just attending a wedding for a few hours. Once we set our fall date I knew that was the easiest part and what was to come would be hard because now we had so many details to decide on. That overwhelming feeling all changed when fate brought me to my first phone call with Allyson Joseph of Bob Gail Special Events. Hiring Ally as our wedding planner was the easiest decision I ever made, we had an instant connection. From the beginning Ally understood our vision and that showed throughout the whole process. She remembered and applied detail that is above and beyond. A five star service I know is one of a kind. We are so thankful for Ally, Lexi, Katie and the whole team. Not only did they do a great job but they work with and recommed the best of the best so our vendors were impecable. I truly don t know what I would have done without her expertise, she just got me and was always there to talk me through every detail. Being long distance from one another that was something I really valued and appreciated. As a result of our wedding not only did we meet an event planner for life but most importantly a friend for life  she truly is like family along with the rest of the Bob Gail team. Having our family and closest friends all together to celebrate our much anticipated day and with so much to be grateful for, it was simply perfection.'
p3147
aS'Our big day was beyond what I could have ever imagined. It was really important to us to provide our guests with an environment that made for an effortless evening, a sense of being taken care of. We wanted them to enjoy and party all night long without any care. Something Ally made sure went off without a hitch thorughout the whole day. When it finally came time to walk down the aisle as soon as I locked eyes with Matthew I knew all the extra stuff was just an added bonus. He truly is my heart and soul. After the ceremony we had a short but very special few minutes alone just us and the sunset where we had a chance to take everything in and just enjoy the moment together. Once we made our way up to the reception area I remember walking in for a sneak peek and even though I knew how everything was going to be set up there was nothing that could prepare me for how special it all felt when I stood in front of all our visions and dreams in real time, it was overwhelming in the best kind of way. From absolutely beautiful weather and scenery all weekend long, to the presence of our closest family and friends, to the exquisite detail, to the gorgous flowers, to the abubndance of food & drinks, and to the most amazing band, we couldn t have asked for a more perfect day. We are so grateful we have beautiful photos from Michael and Anna Costa to look at for years to come and of course a video we can t to watch from Vidicam Productions. Looking back on the day Matthew and I feel so lucky to have shared it all together. It was truly everything we dreamed of and so much more. A special thank you to everyone who was there to celebrate the start of our happily ever after with us.\n'

p3182
aS'Insight on wedding planning We wanted an updated take on a classic wedding. We loved the idea of an evening wedding, but that also meant we might end up being short on time between cocktail hour and dinner. Luckily for us, we both agreed that we were not a fan of the traditional sit-down dinner. We thought it slowed down the momentum, when most people want to dance! We cut the formal dinner and opted for pass tray h our d oeuvres and an extended cocktail hour. We also served late-night fare. My mom was not a fan of this idea in the beginning but after the wedding, we received tons of compliments on not only the quality of the food, but the speedy service. Not one guest went hungry, and there was still time to hit the dance floor. Carondelet House was the only place we looked at when searching for a venue. I did a photo shoot there when it first opened, before Brett & I were even engaged and it just stood out. I took him there and he loved it. We knew we had found our place. It is the perfect blend of vintage style in an urban environment. My dress was next on my list. I knew I wanted something vintage & sexy, but for some reason I was all about lace. Turns out, the lace dresses were not flattering at all! On a whim I went to Lili s Bridal in Encino and I found my wedding dress in their clearance section! It was a discontinued dress by Watters brides. Silk charmeuse ivory, extremely flattering, and under $1000!!! It pretty much had my name written all over it. After I bought the dress & had the venue, it made everything else so much easier.'
p3183
aS'Wedding Details We both looove cupcakes, and Brett introduced me to drinking whiskey bourbon. One of Brett s coworkers is an amazing baker, so she made mini-red velvet cupcakes spiked with red wine   packaged with a still photo of me from our engagement video. My husband, Brett, created the bottle favors with an art deco font. He loves bourbon and bacon, so he infused bourbon whiskey with bacon and bottled it with a still photo of his Baxter McBaggington character from the engagement video.'
p3184
aS'The dessert table was provided by my sister, a culinary chef & food scientist. The chocolate covered bacon she made was a last minute addition to the table, but it was devoured in less than 5 minutes. It was definitely a hit!'
p3185
aS'The S+ B moss heart was inspired by a Style me Pretty post. I saw a sequined heart over the dessert table & I thought it would be cool to have something like that but with a more organic feel. My idea was moss with twinkly lights and antique gold initials. Mary from Poppies & Peonies really brought the idea to life.'
p3186
aS'I sourced all of the antique looking little vases for tableware, etc. from thrift stores & Etsy.'
p3187
aS'Inspired by Pinterest, I used cheesecloth as the runners for the table. It had this really nice soft, dreamy effect.'
p3188
aS'We had a great time collaborating with Talmadge from Pharmacie on the specialty cocktail bar. We had 4 different cocktails. Brett custom made the bar menus as well. The bar menus had a 30 s art deco feel.'
p3189
aS'I sourced most of my ideas & inspiration from Pinterest, blogs like Style Me Pretty, 100 Layer Cake, Green Wedding Shoes, One Fab Day.'
p3190
aS'Reflections for future Brides Be in the moment! I read it so many times in blogs, but it s worth saying again. On your wedding day, you have to let go of the details, trust your vendors, and just worry about you and husband. Oh, and don t forget to have the best time EVER.'
p3191
aS'Highlights Before walking down the aisle, I could hear clapping & cheers from the guests. Even during our vows people were cheering. It was a festive ceremony for sure.'
p3192
aS'My mom and the pianist Vince started a sing-along of  My Girl  during the cocktail hour. Half the guests joined in!'
p3193
aS'Brett and I love to dance and come from a dance background. So when it came to our first dance, we really cut a rug. A few our guest asked us if we choreographed the whole thing!'
p3194
aS'During the first look hour I continued a longtime prank between Brett and his friends called  dummy-ing . I basically made a  dummy  of his Baxter McBaggington character, with his clothes, wig, and a balloon face. I pasted a picture of his character on the balloon. He was so shocked, he found it hilarious, and his friends from New York were so proud of me. I m in the Hall of Fame of Dummy-ing!'
p3195
aS'Right after the ceremony Brett and I took 30 minutes just for ourselves to revel in the excitement, toast, nosh and kiss. It was nice moment to steal away for ourselves, and we could re-enter the party recharged.'
p3196
aS'Brett s first dance with his mother was a goofy dance to the song  Chantilly Lace . It s her favorite. It was a fun moment. The excitement on everyone s face as the late menu was being brought out. It was sliders, French fries, vegetarian hot wings (made with cauliflower instead of chicken).\n'

A trip to the gallery will leave you swooning for days!'
p3233
aS'From Heather Kincaid Photography  Though it was technically Winter, Breehan & Mark had a lovely and warm destination wedding in the desert near Palm Springs, CA. They wanted a glamour-meets-desert wedding full of romance and sophisticated elements, and the Mediterranean style of the Miramonte Resort was the perfect backdrop. Their wedding style was perhaps most evident in their sunset ceremony that featured crystal chandeliers hanging from the large olive tree under which they said their vows. The bridesmaids wore navy blue lace dresses, all in slightly different styles, and the men donned gray suits. The bride wore a beautifully-fitted lace gown.\n'

S'This wedding is out to prove that sometimes the sleekest, chicest weddings involve no color at all. Instead, they take the black and white basics and reinvent them into something truly special. The results? A classic church ceremony paired with a lounge-style reception designed by Two B Events that ll likely find a place on your list of wedding favorites. Taylor Made Art captured the gallery, Taylor Hawkins crafted the film, and both gorgeous bits are too good to miss.'
p3276
aS'Both being musicians, it was divine providence Colin s groom s room was decked out with instruments, leading to an impromptu jam session before the ceremony, while Caitlin wore a  Save That Pillow  tank while getting ready as a nod to a song she had written specifically encouraging women to wait for that special someone. After the bridal party processional, Colin s dad (who was also the officiant) began the ceremony with a flawless, a cappella rendition of The Lord s Prayer.'
p3277
aS'Because they had a long list of loved ones they wanted to invite, Caitlin and Colin chose a lounge-style reception at the historic Women s Club of Hollywood in order to foster a more festive and communal atmosphere than a formal, sit-down dinner could provide. Guests were free to mingle under the chandeliers among cocktail tables and sofa arrangements while sipping on the father of the bride s infamous martinis and helping themselves to a spread of artisanal meats, cheeses, hangar steak and wild mushroom ravioli. After being announced into the club via One Republic s  Something I Need , the couple was showered with heartfelt speeches from the bridal party before the first of two separate dance parties got underway.'
p3278
aS'Dessert of chocolate bread pudding and creme brulee were served while Caitlin and Colin sliced up their own triple berry shortcake (and yes, creamed each other in the process!). Guests were treated to engraved  Love  key favors from The Giving Keys   the organization Caitlin herself founded in order to inspire hope, courage and paying it forward in others.'
p3279
aS'The night ended as Caitlin and Colin escaped under a confetti of white rose petals to their lovingly-decked out Checker, driving down Hollywood Boulevard demonstrating that real, authentic love is always the key to both a successful wedding and the start to a long-lasting marriage.\n'

This New York couple picked the splendid Holman Ranch in the bride s native California for their Caribbean-inspired nuptials. Coral hued bouquets from Fionna Floral and DIY ikat runners obviously made photographer Cooper Carras s job a delight. Inspired? Make sure to check out the full gallery!'
p3307
aS'Holman Ranch is spectacular. It is an intimate escape with a special combination of natural beauty and relaxed elegance. My husband and I knew we would be able to spend a weekend full of fun with our guests and enjoy special time with loved ones who flew in from around the world. Planning the wedding from New York, where we live, was a challenge, but once we picked Holman everything seemed to fall into place.'
p3308
aS'As a California girl at heart, I knew I wanted an outdoor ceremony and reception. Sky, mountains, and hills are all around you as you say your vows. It s absolutely breathtaking. My husband and I both love running, biking and being out on the water, so being able to stage every part of our wedding outside was a real draw. Moving from the ceremony, to the cocktail hour, to the dinner, to dancing has a magical quality of discovery to it.'
p3309
aS'We were engaged in the Caribbean, on a beach we had visited many times together. We knew we wanted to incorporate elements from this very special day into our wedding reception. He proposed by carving  Will You Marry Me?  into a piece of driftwood, that I discovered in the sand. We decided to name every dining table after a beach we had been to together. Selecting the names of the beaches and carving them in with the latitude and longitude was a memorable, if unexpectedly challenging part of the wedding planning process. Each place-card was then attached to a piece of driftwood, directing you to your table. My brother, of AJ Bain Design, created all of our paper products from menus, to programs, to our save the dates which were printed on wood. My mom designed the beautiful blue ikat table runners and pillows that reminded us of the changing colors of the ocean in the Caribbean  After dinner we served bushwacker s a local drink that tastes like liquid tiramisu.'
p3310
aS'Our unflappable planner, Amy Byrd, helped us pull together the weekend we were hoping for. She was unstoppable, ever ready, and incredibly observant. We got to enjoy the day as she took care of all the small stuff. She helped steer us to a wonderful set of vendors that were perfect for the intimate wedding we wanted. That includes Nancy and John at Paradise Catering who spent a great deal of time working with us to come up with a fantastic seasonal menu. They created an ideal meal  including recreating an amazing fig salad that we both love.'
p3311
aS'Our florist, Sarah, of Fionna Floral, captured an unstructured elegant look in stunning arrangements. We knew that during the ceremony we didn t need to compete with the landscape at Holman, so we created two large bouquets of white delphinium with white passion flower. Two smaller arrangements marked the start of the aisle. When it came to the rest of the flowers I knew that wanted color in our wedding, and lots of it. Pink really popped in a natural landscape of blues and greens. We used dhalias and passionflowers throughout our arrangements. We also anchored many of the floral centerpieces at dinner with protea  in honor of the South African side of my family.'
p3312
aS'One unexpected challenge we encountered was finding our wedding cake. Bobby and I knew we didn t want a traditional cake. We decided on Key Lime Pie, in honor of a sentimental connection to Key West. Finding a Key Lime Pie in San Francisco and the Monterey Peninsula proved to be well  difficult! After rounding up a taste test judged by my family, the unanimous winner was the amazing Black Jet Baking Company in San Francisco.'

S'Throwing a winter wonderland wedding  in sunny California isn t always easy, but for these two sweeties and their crafty ways, it was a total breeze.  I m talking DIY goodness every which way you look with pine cones dotting every table, a hot chocolate bar and a gray and white color scheme that just screams chilly chic.  See every beautiful moment captured by Josselyn Peterson in the full gallery.'
p3456
aS'From the Bride  Our vision for the wedding was to bring a rustic winter wonderland to Southern California at the end of December. We had a long engagement, so over the 13 months we were able to do many of our own DIY projects to carry out this vision.'
p3457
aS'Many of these projects were incorporated at the ceremony. During our family camping trip in June we collected several pine cones of all shapes and sizes to use for decor. We used them at the ceremony location in the flower arrangements, bouquets and boutonnieres, and we made a pine cone garland to line the aisle. We continued our projects after a friend, and groomsmen, had a fire on his large property. This forced him to cut down several dying pine trees. He cut the trunks into stumps that we used to line the aisle. These stumps were topped with glass bottles that we cut the bottoms off of to shield candles from the wind. We also routed out the center of branches to create additional candle holders. More of the branches were used to form the arch that we were married under.'
p3458
aS'It was not easy to make the day feel like winter when it was a sunny 75 degrees. Luckily our ceremony was held in the shade. I was lucky enough to borrow a silver fox fur that belonged to a friends grandmother from the late 1800 s. I was determined to wear it despite the warmth. We also had blankets available to keep people cozy just in case they were chilled. We also had a hot chocolate bar and a cold apple cider to go along with the horderves after the ceremony.'
p3459
aS'The theme continued at the reception site. Our reception site was a major project in its own. My husband and I met at a local dance studio, the owners, and now in-laws, introduced us while I was taking lessons there. We planned to have our reception in the place we met. A few months before the wedding, the studio decided to move locations. With only weeks until our big event, my now brother-in-law along with a friends and family members, managed to turn a warehouse building with no walls and a concrete floor into a gorgeous space for us to celebrate our wedding. Preparations continued up until the day before the wedding with trim work and lighting still going in.'
p3460
aS'We spruced up the space even more by adding Christmas trees with picture ornaments that my mom, mother-in-law and I made. The pine cones made another appearance by serving as our place cards and we used giant pine cones to decorate the large front windows. We continued to recycle the pine trees. I was able to use cross sections of the stumps for our table numbers. I took each one and nailed in several nails to form the numbers and create a rustic look. I also used a routing tool and wood burning pen to create little signs to decorate the reception. We brought the candle holders and glass bottles from the ceremony and used them as table decor. We made hot chocolate favors for everyone to take home to continue enjoying our wedding even after they left.'
p3461
aS'We recommend you have plenty of time to complete your projects. It took several attempts and failures to come up with our final products. We could not have carried out our vision without the help of so many of our friends and family. We were blessed to share the planning and prep with those closest to us. We loved doing most of the work ourselves. We were able to create everything the way we wanted and have many keepsakes to take away from the day.'

S'We love a rustic wedding, but we think it s pretty cool this couple choose a ranch venue and decided to steer away from the assumed bent. The result, as you can see in Sargeant Creative s photos, was pretty stunning. With help from Kate Fujimoto, they went for sophisticated and earthy touches like flax linens from La Tavola and blush blooms from Moon Canyon Design strategically scattered throughout.'
p3511
aS'From  title= Kate Fujimoto Event Design  href= http://www.katefujimoto.com/ >Kate Fujimoto Event Design Working with Misty and Tim and helping them to create a beautiful day, filled with warmth, romance, and playfulness, was a highlight of 2013 for me. We spent about ten months prepping for the wedding, and during this period, Misty and Tim were in their first year of medical residencies. They had incredibly stressful workloads and restrictive schedules, but Misty and Tim were really dedicated to making sure that their wedding was a true reflection of themselves. Despite having literally no time to sleep because of their crazy shifts, they always approached every task with an enthusiasm, energy, and sense of humor that made the business of planning a really fun experience for everyone involved. Misty told me,  We want our guests to feel loved, excited and uplifted on our special day,  and she and Tim poured their hearts into every detail to make this a reality.'
p3512
aS'Misty and Tim chose Calamigos Ranch in Malibu as their venue as it perfectly captured the earthy, but elegant, vibe that they had envisioned. They fell in love with the ceremony space, which was situated under an enormous oak tree. There were cascading twinkle lights hanging from the tree and the lush landscaping made the space feel intimate, even with 175 guests. The reception spaces, which included a large lawn, an indoor area with bar and dance floor, and a tented, draped patio for dining, allowed for a lot of activities and were ideal for providing different types of entertainment throughout the event.'
p3513
aS'Misty and I talked at length about a design that would complement all of the spaces. Misty and Tim didn t want to go in an overly rustic direction, with more typical ranch inspired motifs. Instead, they really wanted to create an elegant backdrop, with whimsical touches and fun elements. We therefore decided on doing a fairly neutral base, natural flax linens for the ceremony and cocktail hour and a slightly stronger tone in silk dupioni for the reception, upon which we layered feminine peach and cream florals and green garlands from the amazingly talented Kristen Caissie of Moon Canyon Design. Kristen and I spent time figuring out what would best highlight the ceremony space, as the oak tree was such an overwhelming presence. We both thought that a summery garland of peach and cream florals and greenery, swagged around the trunk of the tree, would be most beautiful and effective. It was simple idea, but so chic. We complemented the swag with florals in wire vessels that were hung from the branches of the tree. In the dining area, Kristen carried over the garland idea to both the center dining table, as well as to the backdrop that sat behind the sweetheart table. She actually anchored the backdrop to two huge  branches  in order to maintain the earthiness that Misty and Tim liked. We transitioned from wooden vessels in the ceremony and cocktail spaces to silver urns in the dining room to create a certain flow from afternoon to evening. The dining space, wrapped in the glow of candlelight and strands of twinkle lights above, looked magical.'
p3514
aS'Although aesthetics were undoubtedly important to Misty and Tim, they really wanted their guests to have fun! Being an adventurous, free-spirited couple, they felt strongly about incorporating more whimsical touches to their wedding. The large lawn in the reception space lent itself to creating sweet picnic-type vignettes and lawn games. We bought blankets, custom-made pillows and vintage tray tables which we painted white and paired these with lawn games (including a not-so typical choice of Jenga, which the couple loves to play). Misty and Tim actually made the bean bag toss board with silhouettes, which was such a big hit with both adults and kids. Guests really did use the blankets for lounging during the cocktail hour, which was such a great alternative to the usual rental chairs and tables. We enlisted a three-piece bluegrass band to play during guest arrival and cocktail hour. Triple Chicken Foot did such an excellent job at setting a festive tone and making the party comfortable and inviting. Their music was engaging and, most importantly, fun. Probably the most playful parts of the wedding were the touches that Misty and Tim incorporated from their favorite movie,  Up.  We made  Up  themed bottle cap escort cards, which were filed into streamlined custom wooden planks   so as to mesh with the elegant tablescapes that we had prepared in all of the various areas of the wedding; we put together a cool display of  Up  memorabilia for the guestbook table; and we tossed balloons during the bride and groom send-off with a sign that read  Up, Up, and Away   A Balloon Send Off On Your Wedding Day! '
p3515
aS'I think that one of the most special moments of the wedding was a surprise for Misty and Tim, conceived by one of Misty s best friends and bridesmaids. Instead of a standard speech, Misty s friend enlisted Kaba Modern, a dance group that Misty had seen on TV (and absolutely loved), to jump in and perform a set for the bride, groom and guests. It was a really special gift   the dancing was incredible and so lively   it was really the perfect way to segue into the dance portion of the evening. The night progressed so quickly, as guests made their way between a photobooth, a tasting of delicious bite sized desserts, and dancing of course. There was never a dull moment from start to finish at Misty s and Tim s wedding and, from that perspective, it was an exact reflection of the two.'

Leo Patrone s captures surpassed even our wildest expectations and it has everything to do with the bold hues, punchy patterns and beaming couple in every last snap. Blooming Floral Studio + Kae & Ales made the magic happen and a trip to the gallery plus Diana and Jame s Twitter-initiated love story is well worth a read!'
p3589
aS'From The Bride James and I met over twitter almost 3 years ago now when he tweeted at me on one of my features. At first I didnt reply but then I did with a direct message to say hi because we are both in the wedding industry. Myself as a photographer and James owns a wedding stationery company called OOXX Invitations in Toronto. That was the start of our 2 year long distance relationship. Me in Orange County and James in Toronto, Canada.'
p3590
aS'One day when I was visiting James in Canada, we went venue shopping with another friend who was getting married and they wanted us to check out some venues with them and when we found out there was only a few dates left for the following year, we decided on that day that we should probably consider looking for a venue for ourselves even though we weren t engaged yet. A few weeks later we decided on Nestldown in Los Gatos, CA. We wanted it to be a destination wedding for both his family and mine. James proposed a couple months after we already put a deposit down.'
p3591
aS'Wedding planning was a real joy for me. I ve shot my fair share of weddings and knew what I wanted. I wanted something classic, glamorous and timeless. The venue itself was so beautiful it didn t need too much dressing up but we knew we wanted beautiful flowers, and a gorgeous reception. We brought in gold chargers, gold chevari chairs and cutlery. James did all the custom signage for us, my mother made the linens for the Kings table (James wanted patterns and this is where we brought it in) and we had a stunning runner of flowers down the center. We also had a camera station seeing that I was a photographer and wanted something that reflects that. It was all pulled together and styled by Kae and Ales, wedding stylists from Portland OR who we brought in to do it for us.\n'

p3668
aS'From The Bride To be honest, we didn t have a big vision of what the overall style or theme would be, but we did know it had to be us; fun, intimate, artistic, and most of all low stress. Living in Los Angeles, we decided to semi-elope and get married in the Mural Room at the Santa Barbara Courthouse. Most of the wedding planning and ideas came from gathering inspiration from Pinterest and Etsy. As a matter of fact, I found our amazing photographer, Aimee on Pinterest, as well as Stephanie, who designed my dress. We set a date of 11/12/13, which was a Tuesday. Because of the time of year, we decided the color theme would be burnt orange and earth tones. With that, we had the women pick whatever orange dress they wanted and the men wore the earth tone vest of their choice. Dylan also is known for wearing mismatched socks, so we gave the men mismatched socks to wear as well.'

aS'We wanted to make our wedding as personal as possible by adding our own creative flair. Dylan designed our invitations and thank you notes. We made the top half of our cake at Duff Cakes Mix on Melrose; decorating it to our liking. Charm City Cakes made the bottom half the of cake to match the top.The last theme we integrated into our wedding was lobsters. We call each other  my lobster  because lobsters mate for life. This allowed for us to integrate our artistic sensibilities as well. We had Jackie, an amazing artist friend, make the boutonnieres, which were, of course  lobsters. Jackie also made my bouquet, corsages and the flowers that the women carried. The wedding day was perfect; it was everything I imagined it to be. Even if our plans hadn t come together so well, it still would have been perfect   After all, I married my lobster!'

aS'From the Groom  As the sun crested the horizon over the San Diego Wild Animal Park, the elephants and lions weren t the only creatures stirring.  We had stayed the night alongside nature, lulling the animals to sleep with the gentle sounds of our snoring. It was 6:00am, the last day of the weekend, and I knew I only had a little time before the other campers would be up.  We walked over to the railing of the elephant enclosure; Alison s favorite animal. Once I had a clear shot, I set up our little camera and walked over to her.  The setting was just right. Elephants milling around in the background, no chatty tourists around, and the girl of my dreams in front of me, I pulled out the ring, took a knee, and, now eye level (she is 4 11 to my 6 5), asked her to spend her life with me. She said yes!\n'

Because as hard as I try, words just won t do this seriously stylish soiree justice. So do yourself a favor today, and get lost long enough in this gorgeous gallery to really soak up every last moment, because ladies and gents, it doesn t get better than this.'
p3817
aS'From the moment we started planning, we knew we wanted our wedding to reflect our style, but most importantly we wanted our loved ones to have a really fun and memorable night. Since both of us grew up in California, we decided to have our wedding in my hometown, Sacramento. We were going for an Art Deco inspired vibe. We only looked at 3 venues in Sacramento, and we when stepped into the Sacramento Grand Ballroom we knew it was the one. Built as a bank in 1912, it s one of the most historic buildings in downtown Sacramento, with beautiful architecture and 45-foot gold leaf ceilings.'
p3818
aS'Aaron and I were planning our wedding from across the country, so we wanted to make sure we had a great team helping us along the way. We were fortunate enough to find incredible vendors that understood our vision and made our day so special and magical. In hindsight, we re glad we didn t compromise on our photographer, DJ, and wedding planner.'
p3819
aS'I spent the morning getting ready with my bridesmaids at The Citizen Hotel. For the bridesmaids dresses, I chose blush and grey as the color palate, with the girls wearing different styles. To pull the look together, I gave each girl a necklace from Baublebar. The groomsmen wore midnight blue tuxedos from The Black Tux and a white flower lapel pin, instead of boutonnieres.'
p3820
aS'When we walked into the reception, we were blown away by how gorgeous and romantic the venue was. The ballroom was filled with candlelights, gorgeous white flowers and feathers in tall silver candelabras, and accents of gold throughout. Our DJ set the tone perfectly for each part of the reception. Our beautiful and delicious cake was made by my two talented aunts. For our favors, we had cookies from our favorite New York City bakery, Momofuku.'

aS'We put our heart and soul into all of the details and loved that the Santa Barbara Historical Museum offered a beautiful blank canvas where our imagination could run wild.

aS'The lower courtyard was draped in pale pink and cream flowers and fresh rosemary and thyme lined the aisle. I walked toward my husband as a flamenco guitarist lightly strummed our song. After the ceremony our guest were invited to join us in the courtyard for local wine from Consilience winery and amazing Tapas prepared by New West Catering. As a newly married couple we made our way through the crowd welcoming our guests and enjoying the enchanting Flamenco dancer and guitarist preform.'
p3863
aS'A traditional Spanish dinner of Paella was prepared on site and served family style to our guest. The menu was planned out to be similar to the meal that Reza and I ate the night that he proposed to me. Having wonderful tasting food that was locally sourced and had organic ingredients was very important to us to enhance the experience to our guests. The sun began to set and the love and laughter filled the courtyard while the fountain cascaded behind us.'
p3864
aS'After dinner our guests danced the night away under the warm fall Santa Barbara stars. On October 27, 2014 I married the man of my dreams surrounded by everyone that we love.'

It was such an amazing pleasure to spend an afternoon with them wandering around sampling the produce and enjoying the peaches in the orchard. They so clearly love each other. They share the same humor, they finished a majority of the other sentences and the looks they got when they thought I wasn t watching just made my heart happy. Plus, they re hilarious.

p3931
aS'From the Bride After Nevin proposed to me atop Hampstead Heath overlooking the city of London, we began thinking about what type of wedding we wanted to have. We knew we wanted to include aspects of both of our cultures (Indian and British/American), while making sure that it was a fun and memorable event for the guests. We had both a Hindu ceremony and a secular wedding ceremony. After making the decision to have two ceremonies, our theme developed into a merging of the two cultures into one fun-filled day of celebrating. We chose elephants as a motif, as Nevin rode into the Hindu ceremony on an elephant. To that end, we included elephant salt and pepper shakers and elephant escort card holders. We also wanted to incorporate the bright colors of Indian weddings throughout the entire day, so we had bright florals and bright menus and programs.'
p3932
aS'We had two meals: an English tea, complete with scones and tea sandwiches, and an Indian buffet dinner. Overall, we had an amazing day that we felt reflected our cultures and our personalities perfectly!\n'

p3967
aS'From The Bride When I think of our love story, the words that come to my mind are courage, joy, faith, trust, sorrow, and faithfulness. Courage defines the beginning of our relationship and the courage Daniel and I had to take a risk on one another just 15 months ago. Joy defines the entire relationship of discovering our mutual passions, interests, and love of being together. Faith and trust came on the day when Daniel told me he would be leaving for a 7 month deployment to Afghanistan just five short months after we met. Faith and trust in the Lord and each other have sustained us through trials, separation, distance, and fear. Sorrow has come with separation and longing to be together. And faithfulness, the faithfulness of God has reigned true in our love story as we look back on our lives before we met, our meeting, dating, falling in love and marrying. We have seen God s faithfulness to prepare us for each other and make us better together.'
p3968
aS'Ever since I was a little girl, I always wanted to get married outside. When I dreamt about my wedding, I would picture two things- getting married under oak trees and dancing under the stars and twinkle lights. Daniel and I love the outdoors and it seemed so  us  to get married outside, with mountains, blue skies, big trees, and gorgeous greenery. The first thing I did when I got engaged was call Jacob and Christin to see when they were available! I knew that I wanted them to photograph the day. I was lucky enough to mention to Christin that I wanted to get married outside in a rustic setting with mountains and a beautiful setting. Jacob and Christin suggested the Temecula Creek Inn and the moment my parents and I drove out there and saw the stone house venue, I knew it was perfect! A ceremony under a beautiful wooden arch with oak trees above? Perfect! A beautiful old stonehouse with outdoor reception? Perfect! A dance floor with twinkle lights? Perfect! And a sweet little bridge connecting the ceremony to the reception, perfect! I got to work with my amazing sister Hayley, who loves decorating, design, and pinterest, creating what she called a  country rustic chic  look. I loved growing up in california where natural beauty is everywhere and Daniel loved growing up in the south (Georgia). We combined our love for the outdoors with our love for anything country and added beauty, sweetness, and  pretty things  like lace, doilies, and the color pink! I wanted our guests to get to know Daniel and I and to have fun at our wedding. One of the best compliments I got after the wedding was that our wedding was so  us.   Wow, that is the best compliment ever!'
p3969
aS'One of the most important things to me was that all of the people we loved got to be involved. It was so special to me to have my aunt set up the cupcake table, one of my mom s best friends did the flowers, my father officiated the wedding, good friends sang and played music, passed out programs, and coordinated the guest book. We hardly had any vendors at our wedding where we did not have a previous relationship with them. I loved that. The other thing I loved was how many of my friends and family were involved in our special details and DIY projects. My maid of honor Elise designed our programs and assembled them with me. Elise also hand wrote every name card. My matron of honor Lindsay created and made two burlaps banners, one that said  Just Married  and another that said   Gifts . My sister Hayley handwrote all of our chalkboards- the menu board, the instagram boards, the ringbearer sign, the cupcake signs, etc. Hayley also wrote every guests name on our window seating chart. Hayley was the designer of my centerpieces, as well and she came up with the polaroid guest book idea   a favorite of mine! My mom collected family wedding photos of my family and Daniel s family and created a beautiful display inside the stone house. My mom also frayed and ironed all the burlap, made beautiful table runners, and painted the L & D signs. Daniel also got in on the action. Daniel built beautiful standing wooden signs. Daniel built them and then Elise painted them. Daniel also created a slideshow of our pictures growing up to be displayed in the stone house. My aunt Debbie set up the cupcake table and my grandmother (Mimi) and cousins (Marissa, Katie, and Amy) created and assembled my s mores favors. My mom and I covered every mason jar with burlap and lace. Pretty much my entire wedding was DIY and I loved it that way! I had so much help to make my dreams a reality and it turned out amazing.'
p3970
aS'I had so many favorite moments. Praying with my bridesmaids before the ceremony, walking down the aisle with my dad, reading my vows to Daniel, the sword arch, my first dance with Daniel, my crazy choreographed father daughter dance with my dad, cutting our cake with a sword, and dancing the night away with people I love most were all so amazing. But I would have to say my favorite moment was when Daniel and I read our vows to one another. We wrote our own vows and neither of us are short on words! When we were reading them, I forgot an audience was there. I was simply telling my best friend, my love, the man of my dreams what he means to me, how thankful I am for him, and who I hope to be for him. I was promising my sweetheart my heart, mind, body, and soul and that was all that mattered. I loved that moment too because I felt the presence of God and experienced His love for me in a way I never had before. It felt like it was just me, Daniel and Jesus for that brief moment and it was quiet, sweet, beautiful, and holy and I loved it.'
p3971
aS'In the entire wedding planning process and the day of my advice is this: savor, choose joy, choose gratitude, take pictures, say  thank you,  have fun, laugh, say  I love you,  remember you are special, unique, enough, and worthy, and look into the eyes of the man you love and remember the best thing you are getting out of the whole process is at the end of your wedding day, you are the wife to that wonderful man standing into front of you and you get to spend forever with him.'

S'As a true lover of all things Father of the Bride, private estate weddings are most definitely my happy place.  But give me a private estate wedding from a talented team of California vendors + one style savvy interior designer bride and that s an entirely new level of happy. Think So Happi Together, Catering By Brenda and EP Love (to name a few) all coming together for one crazy gorgeous day.  See it all here.'
p4034
aS'From the Bride  Patrick and I met while building a 40,000 square foot estate in Beverly Park, Los Angeles, back in 2005. His company was in charge of the construction management while mine was in charge of designing the interiors. I can still remember his thorough organizational skills and meticulous attention to all our design details. We started dating almost immediately after, fell in love, and the rest, as they say, is history.'
p4035
aS'Through our six lovely years together, we built and designed many other homes, adopted and raised a little bundle of joy (our dog, Olive), and made many happy memories laughing and traveling together. I can honestly say that no one makes me laugh as hard or as often as Patrick does. Then one day, on my birthday, we were at the park playing catch with our dog, Olive, when Patrick asked the big question. The moment was perfect. Even Olive seemed to share in our joy, barking and jumping in circles all around us. And unbeknownst to me at the time, watching Olive chase after the ball on that beautiful day was the inspiration behind most of the handmade details I made for the wedding.'
p4036
aS'As an interior designer, I ve always felt that it s the smallest details that carry projects to an even deeper and greater level of beauty. I carried this philosophy when planning our wedding so that it could be a truly unique and beautiful experience for our friends and family. My goal was to try to think outside the box by taking everyday objects and elevating them with thoughtful details. For instance, I took apart some unused drapery tiebacks made out of hand-dyed and sculpted paper and incorporated them into the wedding stationery details, ceremony programs and ribbon wands. I also took boxes left over from all the accessories we purchased for our design projects and covered them with different fabrics. These boxes were used to display the amber glass pieces and other glass objects I had collected for creating the table centerpieces. I also used different colors of leftover silk string that comes with our custom rug purchases to wrap ombre patterns around some of those glass vases. The table centerpieces looked enchanting with all the various flowers that I had imagined in the months before   fringe tulips, pieris, mink protea, ranunculus, dahlias, scabiosa flowers, and my favorite, poppies.'
p4037
aS'I was also very lucky in having a few fabrics left over from past design projects. I used some beautifully crocheted fabric leftover from one of our drapery installations and cut them into panels to make table runners. My mother took another leftover drapery fabric and used it to sew all the napkins for the guests (she sewed over 200 napkins!).  Another great find was an old metal fabric panel that was purchased from an antique textile shop in Paris; I was able to use this as the backdrop for our photobooth!'
p4038
aS'Another goal I had was to give a whimsical, youthful edge to all the little details. A friend of mine, Yolanda, drew the illustration for our save-the-date, which was inspired by our proposal at the park. She also drew the beautifully detailed illustration of the map and the fa ade of the house that we were married at, which I incorporated into our wedding invitations. And because I wanted to preserve the hand-drawn, imaginative look of her sketches, I hand-printed all the stationery with my Gocco printing press. I carried this whimsical touch into the rest of our signage with the image of our dog, Olive, springing after the ball. I sewed little bouncing trails with French knots as the balls onto all the name cards. I also embroidered ombre colored letters with bouncing details onto the fabric signs using the same silk string that was wrapped onto the glass vases. I had so much fun creating all these little details with my wonderful mom and bridesmaids.'
p4039
aS'The wedding took place on September 2, 2012 at one of our clients  residences in Beverly Hills, California. We were incredibly lucky to have such generous clients; we could not believe it when they offered their home to us for our wedding. It seemed like a dream come true to be married in a situation similar to how we met (this was the latest project that had just been completed by both our companies). We held the ceremony in the front yard and the reception in the back. We were initially a little worried that the lawn area in the front was not large enough, but the setting ended up being astonishingly beautiful. Our wedding planner, Nancy, suggested having a circular ceremony that would feel intimate and also maximize our space. My most magical memory of the day was stepping out of the house into a circle of guests waiting in the front yard. It was truly breathtaking   standing underneath a canopy of trees with garlands of flowers hanging all around us, surrounded on all sides by our friends and family.'

S'I can spot a California wedding from a mile away. There s something about al fresco receptions and super cool vibes that set my heart a  flutter time and time again. Add in lush bloomage from Dragonfly Floral plus photography by Bia Sampaio and Jason Walz, and you ve got a wedding with  SMP  written ALL over it. Dive in right here.'
p4075
aS'From Jason Walz Photography  When the Groom, one of my best friends, contacted me to say he was engaged, I was thrilled. We share memories going back to fourth grade, and there was no way I was going to miss being a guest at his wedding. Furthermore, even though he didn t ask me to do so, there was no way I was not going to photograph his wedding as my gift!'
p4076
aS'The groom told me it would be a casual affair with good food in Sonoma, which sounded great. But I had no idea I that it would be a SUPERCOOL and SOPHISTICATED casual affair with amazing details to boot. After hearing more about his and his fiancee s plans, however, I knew it wouldn t take much to talk the fabulously talented photographer Bia Sampaio (who happens to be my wife) into putting the weekend aside to photograph alongside me.'
p4077
aS'Barndiva, simultaneously casual and chic, had the perfect vibe for a Sonoma wedding, as did the bride and groom s attire, the flowers, the food, wine, etc! And the personal touches, such as having a best friend officiate the ceremony, another best friend MC the evening, and yet another best friend contribute intimate decor touches including a seating chart, table name boards and place cards, knocked the charm factor out of the park.\n'

S'Of all the weddings I come across on a daily basis, it s weddings like this one that truly captivate me. Ones where I get so lost in the couples  description, I almost feel like I was there. So I encourage you to do the same. Their thoughtful words below describe a wedding that was not only beautiful (thanks toKate Siegel Fine Events and Poppy Stone), but filled with meaning and love, and thanks to Meg Messina s gorgeous images below, you can lost in their gorgeous day here.'
p4127
aS'From the Bride As with the most important of life s passages, you often only fully appreciate their meaning by experiencing them. And so it is, we discovered, with getting hitched. Because you hear about weddings, and read about them, you see them in movies and you attend them, rejoicing all the while in the love and joy that abounds, and then one day you set off, without the proper training, to plan one yourselves. How quickly it is apparent what a monumental proposition a wedding really is.'
p4128
aS'First, as often, was the  where . After looking in Kate s hometown of San Diego and in Los Angeles, where we now live, we realized we aspired to a place that would be new to us, which we could meet first as a couple and always associate with as such. It so happened that soon after some dear friends of ours mentioned their family home in the town of St. Helena as a possibility. It was a generous gesture; we will always be grateful for it. Pulling into that town our first trip there, we were immediately smitten. St. Helena is one of those wonders where life seems beautifully blessed and yet remarkably low key. Outstanding restaurants proliferate, on every corner and in every alleyway; a handsome main street is forever postcard-ready; and, the surrounding landscape is a verdant shuffle of flats and hills, glades and valleys. Of course, too, there is all that wine.'
p4129
aS'More than anything, it was the house and back garden that captivated us, the house pure Arts and Crafts, an original Bernard Maybeck. It is not large, which is part of the appeal the proportions just right. But it is magical, both simple and splendid, sun-splashed and serene, with a pair of giant redwoods watching in the back and wind chimes swaying on the porch.'
p4130
aS'Mostly, we planned from afar, with Kate s mom Michele (our fearless leader) in San Diego, the two of us in Los Angeles, and our delightfully patient planner one of Kate s oldest friends Kate Siegel of Kate Siegel Fine Events in San Francisco. There was a short trip to establish our basic plan and then, spread up and down the coast, we called and conversed, two steps forward, one back, slowly constructing the elements that would contribute to the day. Our intent, above all, was that it be effortless and easy for guests, an environment allowing them to feel immediately friendly with each other.'
p4131
aS'So we trusted what was already there, letting the simple charm of home and garden do their work. Our layout and plan, the added aesthetic elements, the tone and sequence of both ceremony and celebration were to complement rather than supplant the natural splendor. Expressed another way: we aimed to let the event breathe. (It s also important to say, there was a practical consideration. On a constrained budget who isn t! such focusing and drilling down was as much financial imperative as it was visually attractive.)'
p4132
aS'Our officiant was author and playwright Isaac Oliver, an old friend from New York, who, we are proud to say, stole the show. Whenever the wedding comes up in conversation, it is universally agreed he was quite possibly the best ever. His combination of elegance and charm, wit, humor, and grace, his storytelling, his reflections, his beautiful yet plain language were magnificent. He was perfect.'
p4133
aS'The rest of our team proved similarly, generously flawless. We tapped Chef Patrick Clark of the Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena for sustenance. Food that people love to eat, we said. He delivered organic buttermilk fried chicken and 5-Dot Ranch beef brisket in a dried cherry BBQ sauce, biscuits with maple butter, baby lettuces with plums, almonds, and local chevre, the list goes on, curating wines, as well. His collaborator Corrie Beelzey added custom ice cream sandwiches from her Farmers Market Pantry for dessert. Upon request, Clayton s parents also hand-carried Berger s Cookies, a Baltimore staple, across the country in less than accommodating heat. (St. Helena, it should be said, is also an especially friendly place. The night before the rehearsal dinner Patrick and Corrie invited us on a picnic, offering a number of wines they insisted we try along with cheeses, breads, and homemade spreads. It was above and beyond the traditional duties of a wedding caterer, we decided.) Hartmann Studios delivered a glowing yet unadorned atmosphere; Chris Fox of Boutique DJs got the music just right, even creating a special adaptation of Orbison s Anything You Want for our first dance, which our amazing musician friends Beth Thornley and Rob Cairns sang and played. And Meg Messina, who s wonderful work you are seeing, captured it all brilliantly. Most importantly, family and friends dove in head first to the festivities, laughing, dancing, and dining, and expressing a depth of love and support that made the day the greatest kind of gift.\n'

p4186
aS'From The Bride  Brandon and I met on a friend s dock one Saturday. Before our boat ride, Brandon stole my heart with a funny line from a movie that still makes me laugh to this day. From that day forward, we were attached at the hip. The clich  term  when you know, you know  was the only way to describe our relationship and where we are today. Fast forward seven months later and Brandon proposed to me.'
p4187
aS'I was never one to dream of my wedding day, as a lot of girls do. But, I had one thing in mind: a Santa Barbara estate wedding. I had gone to school in Santa Barbara and Brandon and I would take frequent trips up the coast there. It had become a familiar place to us as a couple and it only felt right that we get married there. And with the beauty that surrounds every inch of that city, I knew I wanted my wedding to be outdoors. We found the Vila Verano Estate within a week of being engaged and fell in love with it! Set in the hills of Santa Barbara, the Mediterranean-style villa offered a picturesque view of the ocean had given us the best of both worlds.'
p4188
aS'From the beginning of the process, I was clueless on what I wanted in a wedding. With so many options to consider, I decided on a simple, yet elegant theme, which truly encompasses my taste. Black, ivory, soft blush, and gold  I couldn t envision anything more beautiful. And, with an outdoor wedding and all that the beautiful Santa Barbara landscape has to offer, I began to realize that I knew what I wanted all along. Every decision that I made was firm and I had zero regrets. My dress was the first big decision I made and it was the second I tried on. I knew it was love at first sight and I never once questioned my choice. All of the other details just seemed to fall into place for me. It was all about choosing things that made me happy on the inside and out. Every detail we chose just felt  right  and the planning process became a very low-stress and fun time for us.'
p4189
aS'We took off from the American Riviera two days later, to honeymoon in the French Riviera. In the end, I wouldn t have changed one thing. I truly enjoyed every single minute of the planning as well as our wedding day. Time stood still for me on October 19th, 2013 and it will forever be a memory.'

With bespoke handmade details around every corner, and a couple so in love you can almost feel it through the screen   this gallery is just as gorgeous as they get.'

aS'From the Bride Our relationship started one warm and sunny Christmas day in Southern California 13 years ago. Both of our families gathered together for Christmas, and we were introduced to each other. I was 14 years old. This yearly tradition continued but it wasn t until seven years later that our real story began  Google chat had EVERYTHING to do with it. Joel was sent alone on business to Dublin, and I was finishing up my final year of college in Utah. We would chat all morning and evening long about everything and anything from our favorite foods and bucket list items to our past relationships and thoughts on love as well as personal aspirations. We grew closer and closer each day, instantly becoming the best of friends. I knew I was going to marry Joel.'
p4257
aS'After I graduated from college a year later, I moved back to California and decided to visit Joel in San Diego. It was during this visit that we realized we were made for each other. For a few months, we spent almost every weekend flying to and from San Francisco and San Diego. Then Joel finally moved to San Francisco. Our friendship turned into love.'
p4258
aS'For three years, we visited the most beautiful places, ate the best SF has to offer, and continuously inspired each other with more and more love. We were lucky in life and lucky in love and we still are.'
p4259
aS'From the Groom On September 2, 2012, I had the honor of asking Sariah to marry me. After a day exploring Angel Island, solitary confinement at Alcatraz and getting hands-on with science exhibits in the Exploratorium, we ended our  tourist day  under the dome at the Palace of Fine Arts, our favorite place in San Francisco. I had suggested on our way out that we should take some self-portraits under the dome. Despite her positive response, I could tell she was onto me. It made for a very awkward and nerve-wracking 200 steps to the pre-determined area. Little did she know that I also had 20 of our closest friends hiding in the bushes and a couple photographers across the pond to capture the moment. I set up my SLR camera on the ground for a  timer  shot, but really I was shooting video the entire time. This, including my initial fumbling into my lens bag for the ring box, is what ensued:'
p4260
aS'Inspiration Behind the Day Joel and I envisioned our wedding to be a fun, relaxed and magical day about everything we love in life. We wanted it to be unique with a lot of heart. From our save the dates until the last dance of our wedding, we wanted the whole experience to be special not only for us but for our family and friends as well.'
p4261
aS'Even before Joel and I became friends, we had a common passion for traveling. Now, our relationship thrives from new adventures in beautiful places. We also appreciate the labor of love put into anything handmade and beautifully aged/vintage so it was a simple and perfect decision to theme our celebration into a lovingly handmade, travel-inspired wedding.'
p4262
aS'Because we love nature, we really wanted to have our wedding outdoors, and Holman Ranch was the perfect place. When Joel and I first set foot on the property, it was love at first sight. The gorgeous grassy ceremony location overlooks their vineyards and olives trees with a breathtaking backdrop of the mountains. The romantic rose patio leads perfectly back to the rustic barn house and the last thing you see before leaving is that magical oak tree. We just knew it would set the perfect scene for the best day of our lives.'
p4263
aS'Paper and Plumes, an event planning venture with my best friend /maid of honor, with the help of some family and friends, was behind the design and every handmade detail of the wedding. From the 40-foot lace burlap runners, chevron napkins, luggage tag escort cards, hand-typed and folded paper airplane name cards, to the rustic wood framed world map guest book, customized chalkboard and wooden signs, travel straws and wood crate tables, we did it all and we loved every second of it.'
p4264
aS'Favorite Memories of the Day Per the advice of our wonderfully talented photographer and friend, Stacey, we took a few moments to have a private moment right after the ceremony. Sitting alone with my new husband immediately after we vowed to love each other for the rest of our lives was truly priceless. I felt very lucky and grateful to have such an amazing man and partner with whom I can share forever.'
p4265
aS'Another unforgettable moment was our first dance. Our talented and dear friends, Chris and Laura Stephens, performed an acoustic medley of two of our favorite songs:  You are the Best Thing  by Ray LaMontagne and  Better Together  by Jack Johnson. Their beautiful voices, the positive energy surrounding us from all of our friends and family and our love it was one of the best moments of my life!'
p4266
aS'Noteworthy Items Shoes. Christian Louboutin from Paris. It is our favorite city in the world, and I wanted to have a piece of it with me for the wedding. '
p4267
aS'Photographer. After talking with Stacey over the phone, I knew she would be the perfect photographer. I loved her style and her personality. However, she was above what we had budgeted, so we talked about it and decided to look for other options. A couple weeks later, Joel suggested that I call Stacey to tell her our final decision. Inside, I was dreading making the phone call because I just loved her so much, so I kept putting it off. Joel kept checking in with me to see if I had called. When I finally called, Stacey mentioned that she had just been booked for a wedding on the day we wanted to reserve. My heart dropped, as I had secretly hoped we would be able to book her somehow. She then said,  Do you know a Joel Gutierrez?  Best. Wedding. Surprise. Ever. I was ecstatic! Not only was I about to marry the sweetest and most thoughtful man, but we will also have Stacey Pentland Photography there to capture it. :)'
p4268
aS'Carriage Lawn. This was one of my favorite areas at the wedding. We created a lounge area for our guests using haybales from the ranch and custom-designed wood crate tables (thanks, Dad!). We also set up a scotch library for Joel and all of our whiskey-loving friends using a vintage wheeled cart from India. It was a hit! At night, the cafe string lights courtesy of our wedding coordinator, Engaged & Inspired, framed the area just perfectly.'
p4269
aS'Wedding Website and Invitation Suite. Inspired by rossplusjess.com, I learned how to use Adobe Illustrator and Squarespace to create a custom wedding website for us (www.luckyinlifeluckyinlove.com). I also worked with Mary Rauzi, an amazing graphic designer, to create a custom save the date and invitation suite to get our guests excited for the wedding!'

S'One look at Kohl Mansion and it s as if you re transported back to a time when elegance and glamour were the everyday norm. And folded into that stately elegance is a wedding with romance built into its very fiber. Captured by Bokeh Photography with design and florals by Nancy Liu Chin Designs, this day is dripping in moody blooms and candlelight. See even more right here.'
p4339
aS'From Nancy Liu Chin Designs .As a wedding vendor, there is an instant connection when your bride picks the same venue that you once got married at. My husband, Kevin, and I picked Kohl Mansion for our wedding because it was this grand, charming, English manor just a short 30 minute drive from urban San Francisco. We always thought of Kohl Mansion as this hidden gem in the Bay Area. Samantha and Gene also fell in love with Kohl Mansion s equally beautiful landscaped grounds set against its brick facade. It s the ultimate venue for a couple who want their wedding to be romantic with an old world vintage charm.'
p4340
aS'Feeling like she could trust me, Samantha let me run with a few of her style ideas. One of the first things I remember from our meeting was that Samantha truly wanted her wedding to feel timeless in a dramatic way. Though she used the word  goth  and  vamp  to describe what she wanted, she meant moody in that romantic moody way. Together we landed on antique blushes, soothing creams, deep chocolates, ebony blacks and vintage brassy golds. Flowers that she loved included the luxurious  Cafe au Lait  dinner plate dahlias, dark smoke foliage, creamy mop head hydrangeas, white anemones with black centers, and other romantic flowers and textural elements. Blushes have been quite popular as of yet but for our bride, Samantha, she wanted to balance the pastels with deep and dark hues that fit the wood interior of the Kohl Mansion s grand ballroom which is a refreshing update to blush and nude hues.'
p4341
aS'Samantha was a very wonderful bride because she had no fear. Tackling decor projects were exciting for her and she utilized her creativity but designing her own invitation suite. Even the paper flowers for the aisle was a task that she was more than willing to take on. Though I am not a DIY fan, I knew in Samantha s hand, she would make sure they were done like a professional.'
p4342
aS'One of my favorite floral details was the asymmetric floral arrangements design for their ceremony canopy. Being that Samantha wanted nothing that was the standard or typical, she wanted the flowers to be off balance which made the canopy more interesting. I m so lucky to have a bride willing to try a different style from the norm because she s so right   it made for a more interesting look.'
p4343
aS'One trend that I like this year is white with black. Her gown with that black ribbon was just enough to make it interesting. Together with Gene, they looked so classy as her gown against his clean tuxedo was perfection. Even though Samantha and Gene dressed to the nines, they didn t take themselves too seriously and had fun which is the most important thing about one s wedding day. You have to enjoy the process and the day because times flies when you are having a blast.'
p4344
aS'From The Bride .My husband and I started dating as freshmen in college and have been together for almost 10 years   this wedding was a long time coming! We always knew we were going to get married but never really discussed the type of wedding we wanted. All we knew was that it had to be convenient for our family and friends (so local to the Bay Area), true to us as a couple, and tons of fun.'
p4345
aS'Kohl Mansion was one of the first venues we saw and we absolutely fell in love. Just pulling into the parking lot, we knew that it would offer the breathtaking and memorable affair we dreamed of. It definitely set the tone for the rest of the planning process. And since we were tackling everything on our own, we knew we had to choose our vendors carefully and wisely.'
p4346
aS'My husband was the sounding board as I created the day. Design was very important to me and I wanted our night to be beautiful. I was most inspired by my Wedding Dress made by the impeccable Vera Wang (you ll swoon after reading her  Behind the Dress  blog post), and florist, Nancy Liu Chin. I imagined romance, modern and classic elements, with some dark enchantment and mystery running throughout. My favorite part of the planning process was bringing this vision to life through DIY projects such as designing the entire invitation suite and paper goods from scratch, and making bouquets of paper flowers from lovely Italian and German crepe paper.'
p4347
aS'When the day finally came and ceremony music was cued, everything just fell into place. Sure it was a hectic and bumpy road getting there, but the ceremony couldn t have been more perfect. The sun was shining, everything looked beautiful, and our favorite people in the world surrounded us. It was surreal. The night continued with free-flowing cocktails in the courtyard, dinner in the romantic, candlelit Grand Hall, dancing, and a decadent dessert bar full of macarons, cupcakes, cakes, donuts, and homemade goodies by my Aunt. Our favorite moment had to be the wedding party introductions which was just so much fun!'
p4348
aS'We could not have done any of this without the help of our amazing vendors and many family and friends. Thanks again to our loved ones for giving us the most memorable night of our lives!'

S'A rustic, family ranch wedding where cowboy boots and belt buckles were the norm and the groomsmen came to the ceremony on horseback might sound too darling to be true, but it is just how this couples  big day unfolded. And if it weren t for the pictures from Kelly Boitano, I would barely believe a wedding could be so sweet, but with one look at this gallery, you ll see it totally was.'
p4504
aS'From The Bride When Matt and I got engaged, we knew right away we wanted to get married at his families  ranch about two and a half north of the Bay Area. Stonyford is a beautiful, small town, tucked away near the Mendocino National Forest. Late Spring is the most beautiful time at the ranch, with everything lush and green. We said our vows in front of a 100 year old barn on their property.'
p4505
aS'Our wedding was everything we envisioned and more. Matt and his groomsmen rode horses to the barn, which had always been a dream of his. My parents walked me down the aisle, and then my father proceeded to marry us, which made the day extra special. Three of my five bridesmaids were eight months pregnant, and such troopers! I wore jewelry from both my late Grandmothers, which meant so much to me.'
p4506
aS'One of my favorite moments of the wedding was when everyone left to enjoy cocktail hour, my new husband and I enjoyed some quiet time alone together before the reception. Instead of tossing my bouquet, we chose to do an anniversary dance   asking all married couples to the dance floor. Such a special moment when the longest married couple left were Matt s Aunt and Uncle (married 50+ years!).'
p4507
aS'The day all flowed together beautifully, and we couldn t have done it without our loved ones help. Matt s mother watered the grass in front of the barn twice a day for weeks leading up to the wedding. Our families spent many weekends restoring the barn we were married in front of. The honey stick favors were all put together by family. Overall, we felt such love and support on our wedding day, and dancing under the stars on the warm Spring night just made everything right.\n'

S'These two are adorable.  And their gorgeous wine country wedding?  Just as sweet.  It s a blush-hued beauty planned to perfection by A Savvy Event that happens to feature one of the most beautiful settings you will ever see (hello there, BR Cohn Winery).  Think towering trees, rustic goodness and pretty blooms from Tesoro all wrapped up in one seriously amazing gallery from Emily Merrill for Kate Webber Photography.  See it here.'

aS'From The Bride  If you believe in love at first sight, then this was it. I noticed Jason the second he walked into the grungy, old bar on Avenue A in NYC that rainy Wednesday night. He definitely did not notice me at first, but by the end of the night I made sure he had. We talked about anything and everything until we were the last people in the bar. He walked me home and planted a goodnight kiss on my lips that left me on cloud 9   I haven t come down since.'
p4552
aS'I had to work for my ring! I was led on a scavenger hunt that pointed me from one place to the next, each location having a special meaning behind it. Even more incredible, was that my clues were hand written letters from Jason that were presented to me by a surprise visitor that he had flown in for the occasion. I finally found Jason along Lake Michigan waiting patiently to propose   which was the same spot we decided to leave NYC and start a life together in Chicago. It was so special to have our friends and family from coast to coast join us in the Midwest to celebrate our engagement.'
p4553
aS'I had a very specific idea in my mind of how I pictured our wedding day   California, wine country, summertime, outdoors, strung lights, relaxed and intimate, so I was able to narrow down the options pretty quickly. BR Cohn offered exactly what I was looking for and more. Planning the wedding long distance, I relied heavily on Pinterest, blogs, etc. to view as many videos and images of the venue I could get my hands on.'
p4554
aS'Jason and I had different opinions of what  our song  was and what our first dance should be at our wedding. Eventually, Jason agreed to let me win and we danced to  God Only Knows  by the Beach Boys. In our vows, which we wrote ourselves, we promised to let the other person  win  from time to time. I stuck true to my vows and without Jason knowing, asked the band in advance to learn his choice of our first dance,  You and Me  by Penny and the Quarters, to play as the last song of the night. The second he heard the first note, he began to cry. We slow danced under the stars taking in what had just been the best day of our lives. We felt as though we were the only people within miles, even though we were surrounded by our closest friends and family. I will always smile when I think back to that moment.'

S'Ojai is this crazy cool place that I have never actually visited, but for some reason, I know I am meant to live there.  Maybe that s because it has some of the most breathtaking sceneries you will ever lay your eyes upon, the sun seems to always be shining and it makes for one stellar place to hold a wedding. Weddings much like this gorgeous day from the talented team of XOXO Bride, TEAM Hair And Makeup and Mi Belle Photography.  It s Ojai perfection in every which way.  See it all here.'
p4596
aS'From the Bride Casey and I were married on one of the most beautiful days in Ojai. Having known each other for almost 15 years, it was an incredibly special moment to be surrounded by our family and closest friends, most of whom had witnessed our relationship grow from an innocent high school fling to happily proclaiming our love for each other as husband and wife.'
p4597
aS'From the moment we drove onto the property at the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, we knew that our decision of where to get married would be easy. We were greeted by the most welcoming, courteous staff and were immediately drawn to the breathtaking mountains and architecture surrounding the hotel. Walking around the grounds, we were nothing short of enchanted. Every nook and cranny of the hotel was meticulously thought out. As we strolled around the property with our two dogs in hand, we looked at each other and knew it felt right.'
p4598
aS'While planning the details of our special day, we tried to keep the specialty of Ojai in mind. We wanted to create a unique environment for our guests that embodied our love of the outdoors and our love for each other. We kept many of the details simple and sophisticated, similar to the style of the hotel. The big surprise for our guests was the reception that took place at the Big Red Barn, located 3 miles from the hotel. We set up cocktail hour on the front lawn of the barn, using hay stacks and wine barrels for tables and chairs. Dinner was served family style, under the stars, and our guests were treated to some of the best local foods prepared by the amazing chefs at Ojai. Casey and I worked as a team planning the day but one of Casey s biggest requests was that we try to create a warm, inviting dinner. He didn t love the idea of separating our friends and family into small groups and having the tables scattered about. With the help of our wedding planner, we came across these beautiful, rustic long tables which helped to create the cozy, dinner atmosphere we were hoping to achieve. After the wedding, many of our guests told us how much they appreciated sitting together as one big group. As dinner came to end, we moved our guests inside the barn and danced the night away under simple chandeliers hanging from the wooden beams.'
p4599
aS'Casey and I feel truly blessed to have been able to plan the wedding of our dreams. Every little detail, from the dessert bar down to the table runners, came together with the amazing help of our vendors. We would have been lost without the help and guidance of Saralee Franchi from XOXO Bride. Saralee was instrumental in helping us create our vision and coordinating all of the events on the day of the wedding. She worked closely with our florist, Nico Cervantes from NLC Productions, as well as the Catering Manager at Ojai, Sarah Pugh. These three were the perfect combination of talent and enthusiasm and we are grateful for all of their hard work and dedication. The final piece to our puzzle was the very talented Michelle Beller from Mi Belle Photography. To say her images are stunning would be an understatement. Michelle and her team of experts did an incredible job of capturing not only the beauty of Ojai, but the many candid moments that took place throughout the day.'

Long story short, we met at Cal Poly, Go Mustangs! Mark popped the question in the snow in Vail, CO. I grew up in the flower fields and wanted the flowers to reflect the  fresh picked  look. The La Perla Del Mar Chapel in Shell Beach was an intimate location where guests could walk out and smell the ocean. The San Luis Obispo Country Club was the perfect choice for us because it embraces the SLO culture. From the Country Club guests had a view of the mountains we frequently hike and the vines in Edna Valley we frequently drink. Mark and I loved the wedding process!'

S'Yes. I know what you re thinking and this is the estate from Scarface. But El Fureidis has also hosted a long list of impressive guests including the likes of Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, and now, Emily and Justin s lovely wedding. With the help of TOAST Events and Design Studio they threw a party worth putting down in the books. To catch all of Chris Orwig s photos, check out the full gallery.'
p4712
aS'From TOAST Event and Design Studio  From the first time we met with Emily and Justin we knew we were going to have fun designing their wedding. With such a fun-loving couple and a unique venue to boot, we couldn t wait to get started!'
p4713
aS'Emily s main source of inspiration came from her venue at historic estate, El Fureidis, in Montecito, CA. The estate is known for its 10 acres of lush gardens, Mediterranean architecture designed by renowned architect Bertram Goodhue, six spectacular reflecting pools, and showcasing in the movie  Scarface . Unique characteristics of the estate were largely influential in our designing over the next few months. Tile patterns from inside a fountain inspired place cards and table numbers made from miniature, handcrafted tiles. Hues from the reflecting pools inspired the blue color palate, spanning from the ribbon wrapping the bride s bouquet, to groomsmen s socks, to handmade drink flags.'
p4714
aS'The organic nature of the estate also ran through the course of the wedding. With boulders frequenting the ceremony site, a stretching lawn set in front of a tremendous Morton Bay Fig tree, guests were seated in organically placed clusters. A harpist played as the bride walked down the aisle in a stunning Vera Wang gown. Guests sipped on homemade margaritas and fresh basil mint mojitos during a relaxed cocktail hour around the pools. While the gardens surrounding the estate allowed for seamless incorporation of blush tones and greenery for the dinner tables.'
p4715
aS'Guests were guided down four flights of candlelit stairs to an intimate dinner a midst the heavily greened gardens. Placed in two of the drained reflecting pools, sat tables covered in vintage decor and organically flowing flowers. Blush colored garden roses, caf  au lait dahlias, lemon leaf, jasmine, and clematis vine spilled out over mercury glass vases. Miniature dishes filled with pink Himalayan sea salt, vintage silver candlesticks, and personalized menus, were just some of the touches added to the tables to further the old-world ambiance.'
p4716
aS'When the dancing began, not even cake cutting could stop this crowd. Emily and Justin climbed on stage, plates in hand, and exchanged bites while guests cheered and danced on! After a second visit from the Santa Barbara police, band, Area 51, led the reception in a lovely rendition of Bob Marley s,  I shot the sheriff  to close out the evening. Not a smile was spared on this magnificent evening and fun was had by all, including us!\n'

S'I m convinced that Thomas Fogarty Winery has some of the most striking views in sunny California. And what more could you ask for on the day you say  I do  to your other half? Not much else is needed, especially with a rockstar team of vendors that made this elegant soiree a celebration to remember. Have a look right here for all the stunning imagery captured by Carlie Statsky.'
p4756
aS'From Carlie Statsky Photography  I love that this couple made their blended families and their beautiful new son a part of the whole day. Dad carried his baby boy into the ceremony so that they could both watch their favorite girl walk down the aisle. Both of them were beaming from the moment that they saw her. Amy Burke did an amazing job with the bright and eclectic floral design. One of my favorite features were the giant balls of flowers that hung from the ceiling in the dining pavillion. Thomas Fogarty Winery is beautiful any time of year, but it was an extra clear day so guests could enjoy views out over the whole Bay Area throughout the evening.'
p4757
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Our goal for our wedding was to achieve a look of simple, understated elegance. We paired the neutral colors of the bridesmaid dresses and table linens with bright pops of color from the flowers. As the wedding was in early November, we knew the weather was going to be a bit of a variable, and even if it was sunny, the temperature would drop as the sun went down. That s why the brightly colored pashminas we offered our guests during the cocktail hour were such a hit. It was also a great way to add more color, while bringing some of Nick s Indian heritage to the day. And they made a wonderful favor for our guests! Other highlights included the amazing floral chandeliers that hung from the Fogarty Pavilion, the delicious food from Le Papillon paired with Fogarty wines, and the music from Daniel at Big Fun.\n'

aS'From the Bride  Our wedding happened to fall on a day called  The Sweetest Day  on our calendar. And it certainly was the sweetest day!'
p4811
aS'I grew up in San Francisco and Dan was born and raised in Aitkin, Minnesota. We had been together for seven years and were both very excited and nervous for our families to finally meet. We wanted to have our wedding at a venue that was naturally beautiful and outdoors- gorgeous enough so that we wouldn t have to put too much effort into decorating! Vine Hill House was the second venue we visited and we decided then and there that we did not need to look any further. We wanted an intimate  backyard wedding  and Vine Hill House was just that and more.'
p4812
aS'Before I started planning for our wedding, my friend said,  Everything isn t going to go perfectly the day of your wedding, but it ll still be the best, most memorable day of your life.  And she was so right. I found some amazing down-to-earth vendors like Jane at the Wild Orchid to put together flowers in shades of peaches and pinks like they had just been snipped from a garden and my photographer Michael L Heureux to capture our memories into the most beautiful pictures. I used Etsy for most of my paper needs including our letter press invitations, went hunting at our local Salvation Army for vintage wine cork holders, and found somebody to custom make my dress inspired by one of my favorites from Monique Lhuillier. Somehow, everything fell into place and I couldn t have asked for anything else.'
p4813
aS'My favorite moment was finally holding hands with Dan after having walked down the aisle with my dad. It felt right and safe and beautiful to profess our love in front of the people closest to our hearts. Because we didn t have a huge wedding, our families and closest friends were able to meet each other, talk, laugh, hug, and dance the night away with one another. I wouldn t have changed a single thing on that day. We are truly the luckiest newlyweds!'

S'Can I just say that California brides have it oh sooo good? Not only are they working with about a million stunning venues and consistent days of sunshine, but they ve got vendors like Carlie Statsky, Violetta Flowers and The Makeup Dolls right at their fingertips. They re the kind of artists that take a bride s distant dream and bring it all to life, and we ve got the proof sitting pretty right here.'
p4889
aS'Framed signs, hand-painted by a dear family friend, directed guests to both the gates of the mansion and to the ceremony location. Kohl s beautiful inset courtyard canopied with bistro lights from Thomas John Events gave our ceremony an intimate setting. Our florist Arlene Boyle from Violetta Flowers created contrast with the mansion s bricks and lush green grounds by using soft blush and white tones in all of the floral arrangements. We wanted our wedding party to feel chic, so we complimented the groomsmen with engraved silver pocket watches, and the bridesmaids  slate gray dresses with chandelier earrings and Joan & David rhinestone shoes (flats, to give our TWO pregnant bridesmaids some relief!). I complimented the lace and satin of my wedding dress with chandelier earrings, a vintage hair clip, and rhinestone shoes from David Tutera (wedges, to give ME some relief!).'
p4890
aS'Our amazing caterer/coordinator Carrie Delucci from Thomas John Events made our vision come together for our reception: She helped us find the perfect dinnerware and place settings to create a romantic feel, complimented by the use of mismatched silver goblets selected by our florist to hold our centerpieces. Throughout the reception, we incorporated additional elements that we felt added a personalized touch to the modern vintage look: an antique silver coffee service from Dana s grandparents, framed signs with love quotes from our favorite classic novels, and a vintage typewriter borrowed from Dana s boss. The food was extremely important to us, as cooking and eating out are some of our favorite things to do together. Thomas John Events blew away our expectations, and everyone continues to compliment us on the meal! '
p4891
aS'Every moment of our journey, from our engagement to the serving of our midnight snack, was captured by our amazing photographer Carlie Statsky. We feel so blessed to have such beautiful images to remember our special day. Our incredibly talented team of vendors perfectly interpreted and delivered our vision, reaching far beyond any of our expectations. We truly could not have asked for a more perfect wedding day. Our dear family friend and pastor Brian Morgan began our wedding day with a blessing on our ceremony and new life as husband and wife; a blessing made palpable through the love that we felt surrounded us through our closest family and friends as we celebrated our marriage. We have both been blessed by parents who have (each!) celebrated more than 30 years of marriage, acting as shining examples for us as we begin our life together. We are forever thankful to our parents, our families, our friends, and to our vendors (who became friends!) for all of their love and support throughout the wedding planning process.'

S'This, my friends, is the epitome of elegance.  A stop-you-in-your-tracks type of affair worthy of your full and undivided attention.  Think one part sophisticated, one part traditional and all parts pretty with Lauren Kendle Event Production (the gorgeous bride) behind every jaw-dropping moment.  In other words?  It s complete perfection.  See it all captured by Raya Carlisle Photography right here.'
p4962
aS'From the Bride  We are very traditional and wanted a very classic garden wedding ceremony. We wanted to add to the beauty and not distract from the already beautiful estate gardens. We went with an all white garden party theme.'
p4963
aS'We wanted our guests to walk from the ceremony down the gravel path into a tent on the polo fields and have an  oh wow  response. Trey came up with the tent decor theme of Rat Pack black, whites and silver decadence, but still classy. We also added in hints of Paris where we got engaged on a bridge.'
p4964
aS'Our wedding flowers were variations of different types of white flowers with hints of silver and light purple. The flowers consisted of hydrangeas, white O Hare cabbage garden roses, white polo roses studded with pearls, gardenias, white phalaenopsis blooms accented with dusty miller.'
p4965
aS'Our wedding was special and unique because of the unique venue and the details. Our venue was a perfect venue for us as a couple. When we originally decided not to get married in a church, we wanted to find a venue that allowed us to have a traditional ceremony then be able to bring our guests into an area where we could create a more elaborate reception.'
p4966
aS'The estate set up perfectly for this. Our guests all said they felt like they were transported into an entirely different place upon walking in the tent. However, what really made it special was the details. The one thing I always tell a client is no matter what your budget is, make the wedding about you and your fiance.  It is all in the details. It is more important than the venue, dress, etc. Your guests want to feel like they are there to celebrate the love between both of you. We incorporated this philosophy into ours by having lots of little details that pertained to us as a couple.  Here are a few examples:'
p4967
aS'1. Guest Book Puzzles (made by Peaceful Wooden Puzzles) the guests took a wooden puzzle piece and signed it. We love puzzles and will have something that maybe someday our kids can put together and see what our friends wrote us years ago.'
p4968
aS'2. We had Eiffel Tower cookies as guest favors because Trey proposed on a bridge called the Ponte Des Arts in Paris with an engraved lock that we hooked onto the bridge while looking at the Eiffel Tower.'
p4969
aS'3. I had Jimmy Choo shoes - 3 pairs! Anyone that knows me knows I LOVES Jimmy Choo shoes. My husband told me before we got married that he thought I was maybe a bit confused, the words I needed to say during the ceremony were I DO  not Jimmy Choo.'
p4970
aS'4. We had a flip-flop bar so that our friends could take off their shoes and dance the night away.'
p4971
aS'5. Bow Tie Napkins   we wanted a napkin to enhance the table setting and anyone that knows Trey knows that if he has an opportunity to wear a tux, he will take advantage of it.'
p4972
aS'6. We hired Entourage from DeBois Entertainment.  They were incredible and our guests loved them! Everyone knows how much Trey loves music and the band played music choices that was exactly what we wanted.'
p4973
aS'7. Cigar and Whiskey Bar   going along with our Rat Pack theme and we had a cigar and whiskey bar that our guests loved. It was located right outside of the tent and you could enjoy a cigar while looking into the tent watching people dance.'
p4974
aS'8. We had a very close family friend officiate our wedding. Our officiant (and his wife) are people who we look up to as husband /wife, father/mother and friends. They took us to countless dinners and acted as our pre-marital counselors. They asked us tough questions and shared with us the ups and downs of a real life marriage. The advice and support is something that we are so blessed to have. It was truly a highlight of our wedding to have our marriage ceremony performed by someone so special to us.'
p4975
aS'We have two favorite memories from our wedding:'
p4976
aS'1. We did not see each other before the wedding. A lot of times couples do first glance photos, but we decided against them and we are so thankful we did. When I saw him for the first time and he saw me; it was an incredibly emotional moment. It was simply perfect. There were 350 plus guests in attendance and it seemed like no one else was there except for us.'
p4977
aS'2. The speeches. We were so touched by our mothers, maids of honor and best man speeches. We were laughing so hard at points and in tears at others. It truly was so special to us.'
p4978
aS'3. Our top favorite moment is probably the last dance. At the end of the night the band announced the last dance and everyone rushed to the dance floor. Our groomsmen had gone to the bar and taken all the champagne bottles they could find and started popping them. Champagne was being sprayed everywhere and we were on on the shoulders of the guys being lifted into the air surrounded by almost every single guest young and old at 11pm!'

S'Smog Shoppe weddings get me every.single.time. I swear it might be the most stylish venue in all the land, and the couples that say I do there always seem to be equally chic. This darling duo is no different, their day was overflowing with lovely, and thanks to Mark Brooke Photographers, you can see it all here.'
p5037
aS'From the Bride When Johnny and I started planning for our wedding, we both knew we wanted a venue that had fun and unique written all over it. We came across the Smog Shoppe online and decided to drive by it to see what it looked like. We actually walked in without an appointment, luckily someone was inside and was nice enough to show us around. We instantly fell in love! We knew we had to have our wedding there! We asked when their next availability was and it was in 2014. We were so sad. We were planning on having our wedding in 2013. We left and continued our search for a venue. 2 days later, the Smog Shoppe calls us and tells us that they just had a cancellation for August 31, 2013. Without any hesitation, we said YES!'
p5038
aS'We kept our decor very simple. Erica and Jackie from live love create events filled the space with hand painted mason jars and filled them with fluffy baby s breath. I loved that the Smog Shoppe was unique and had its own personality but was also so easy to incorporate the things we loved and still looked perfect! Did I forget to mention that I have an obsession with giraffes? Johnny got me one of the giant giraffes when we first started dating almost 7 years ago. The other one was sent over to my hotel room during my Bachelorette party. As you can see we picked the right venue, we can t imagine giant giraffes in a fancy ballroom.'
p5039
aS'I have to say it really didn t hit me that I was getting married. I wasn t nervous at all until I walked down the stairs and saw my dad waiting to walk me down the aisle. I couldn t keep the tears from rolling down my face. Seeing Johnny waiting for me at the end of the aisle was so emotional. I ve never seen Johnny cry like this. We also loved writing our own vows. We felt like we really got to share our special moment with family and friends.'
p5040
aS'One of our favorite parts of the wedding was when we ran out of sand for our sand ceremony. Unfortunately I measured wrong and the unity vase was too BIG for the tiny bit of sand. This is usually a beautiful moment between the bride and groom but we both laughed hysterically along with our guests. This is what reminded us that weddings aren t always perfect and that we were just so happy to celebrate this amazing day with our family and friends.\n'

S'There s nothing I fall for harder than a fall wedding, but this one has me particularly taken. The warm florals designed by L&S Design Co. reflect the mood the season perfectly from the lush bouquets to the abundantly adorned arch. The laid-back sit-anywhere approach is also always a good call for backyard nuptials, too. Eden Day Photography took some lovely pictures of the day. Check out the full gallery here.'
p5065
aS'From L&S Design Co Jeremy and Rheanna s wedding was full of beautiful DIY details! From their photo booth background to the homemade stands for their donut bar. They really put their unique personalities into all of the details. As the floral designer, I worked with Rheanna to come up with a concept that really reflected the season while not being too predictable with the fall stems we used. We used varieties of oranges and pops of white accents.'
p5066
aS'Their outdoor ceremony took place at a friend s beautiful residence. We designed the four posted birch arch to reflect the fun nature of the couple, while still showing the characteristics of fall with the wild bittersweet sticks. The bride s sister walked her down the isle and there wasn t a dry eye in the crowd.'
p5067
aS'For the centerpieces, we made loose and unstructured floral arrangements to sit in the center of the couples long farm style tables. There were so many great details including the home brew specially made by a groomsmen and the popcorn appetizer bar that everyone went crazy for!'

S'This, my friends, is how you wrap up the week in style: with a breathtaking two-day celebration infused with vibrant cultural touches and enough stunning details to keep you drooling all weekend.  The work of a fabulous team of vendors, including Creative Lighting SF, Jennie J. Events and Zephyr Tents, it s what we call stunning and you can see it all captured by Jacqueline Campbell of Birds Of A Feather right here.'
p5122
aS'From Jennie J Events When Meenal & Arjun started planning their fall 2014 wedding they were faced with striking the perfect balance between many competing factors. They wanted to honor their Indian heritage and family with a tradition Hindu ceremony, but also wanted a wedding that reflected their tech-centered modern life in San Francisco.'
p5123
aS'They searched high and low for the perfect venue, from the beaches of San Diego to the urban spaces of Downtown San Francisco. They finally found Carmel Valley Ranch for their Sunday wedding and reception, and Quail Lodge for their Saturday night dance party, traditionally called the Sangeet.'
p5124
aS'45 family members on the groom s side departed San Diego early in the morning on one large bus, arriving at Quail Lodge that afternoon to be greeted by the Bride s side, a simulation of the traditional Jaan arrival. The Bride s side welcomed them as they get off the bus, signing, exchanging ceremonial greetings and small gifts. Traditionally this element of the Hindu wedding ceremony heralded the groom s arrival into the bride s village.'
p5125
aS'That evening guests dined on Southern Indian cuisine while dancing to the traditional Garba, and the Raas dance   featuring colorful sticks called Dandiya s. The bride s family brought the Dandiya s from India, as well as assortment of beaded bangles as favors for the women. They bride s keywords for the Sangeet design were colorful and joyus. We decorated the venue with colorful lanterns, string lights, hurricane candles, scattered rose petals and hanging charms. Guests watched the dancing and lounged on colorful ottomans and large floor pillows. Women dressed in brightly colored Sari s and men in Kurta s danced late into the night celebrating. A golden statue of the beloved Hindi god Ganesha welcomed guests and oversaw a special prayer that left both families in tears.'
p5126
aS'The following day the festivities started early. The groom arrived to the ceremony during the traditional Baarat procession, seated on a white horse his family and friends danced around him to traditional Indian music while moving along to the beat of a traditional Dohl drummer.'
p5127
aS'They were married under a wooden, Dupionique silk draped Mandap designed to be rustic, modern and traditional. Foregoing a bride s bouquet and grooms boutonnieres, Meenal & Arjun wore lush floral leis called Var Mala s. Hung from the Mandap were garlands of magenta roses and orange carnations. Meenal s attendants all wore patterned Sari s in varying patterns and shades of turquoise and aqua.'
p5128
aS'Following the transitional ceremony & cocktail reception guests were welcomed into beautiful sail cloth topped Zephyr Tent. Bistro lights were strong from pole to wooden pole to illuminate the space. This night guest dined on American/Indian fusion cuisine from Carmel Valley Ranch and were treated to hot fresh Naan baked in a Tandoori Oven.  Travel advice  cards were available at every table, a homage to the bride s career and extensive travel as a director of emerging growth for Facebook as well as the couples intention to travel the world with one another after they married. The decor in the tent reflected their clean and natural design aesthetic.'
p5129
aS'Late night everybody moved indoors where they were continued to tear up that dance floor, and were treated to an assortment of vintage video games specially brought into the space to honor the groom s love of video games and his career as a product director in the gaming industry.'

S'We love a wedding full of personal touches, especially when its done this well. With the help of Platinum Wedding by Kerrie and Vanessa Noel Events, this bride put together a thoughtful wedding with intention behind every detail from the music to the burgundy hues in the bouquets from Panacea. The folks from Studio Castillero took some beautiful pictures of the day. For more take a peek at the full gallery here.'
p5186
aS'From The Bride..Daniel and I didn t have a specific  first time we met.  In fact, I don t think either one of us can remember first meeting each other. We ve just always been in each other s lives.\n Daniel s younger sister, Toni was my childhood best friend. Most of my memories of summer vacations, sleep overs, birthday parties, and milestone events include her. And because Toni and Daniel lived 4 blocks away from me, he was always around. In high school, my brother and Daniel also became inseparable, making my existing crush even more intense. Though it was each other s siblings that brought us together, we often found ourselves finding reasons to spend time alone with each other.We bonded over music, books, and movies that were so delightfully dark and intriguing to our burgeoning adolescent tastes. I used every opportunity to seize private moments with Daniel and he searched for the chance to impress me. I remember being at their house for a sleepover with Toni when Daniel walked in her room where we were buried in Seventeen magazines. He interrupted our gossip session for some inane reason that, at the time, seemed legitimate. With an exaggerated cough, Toni pointed out Daniel s excessive use of cologne at 9 PM on a Saturday at home. Of course, to me, his interruption was the best kind of magical.'
p5187
aS'Despite years of building emotional intensity, our first kiss didn t happen until my first year of college on a weekend when I was home from school. If it s possible to have all the passion of 18 years course through a person at one breathtaking moment, it happened with that kiss. It happened after several episodes of South Park and microwave popcorn there was nothing particularly romantic or sophisticated about the moment, except for the years of adoration that led us to it.'
p5188
aS'As dumbfounded as we both were after that magical moment, distance and impetuous youth led to the demise of our relationship after only a few short months. We went in different directions, both embracing our early twenties in our own ways, and didn t speak for over 3 years. When Toni s high school sweetheart proposed, she asked me to be her maid of honor. '
p5189
aS'On the day of Toni s wedding, I was shaking with nerves, for so many reasons: my best friend was getting married (try not to ugly cry), I was the MOH (try not to fall on your face), and I was going to see Daniel after more than three years (try not to look stupid, effected, nervous, jealous, etc.) He was an usher at the wedding and was standing in the foyer of the church when the bridesmaids and I walked in to take our places for the ceremony. I looked at him just as he turned to look at me and I silently mouthed,  I m so nervous.  It might seem an odd thing to say to an ex that you haven t seen in so long, but it was a testament to our relationship beyond romance or complications. With comforting familiarity, he replied,  You look beautiful; you ll be great.  That was the moment we first met; at a wedding where we both brought dates, 16 years after I became his sister s best friend, and 3 years after our first kiss.'
p5190
aS'Daniel and I love riding bikes together and we aren t talking about the flashy spandex, clip in shoes kind of biking; we re talking a beach cruiser, nowhere to be, let s get lost kind of ride. It was May and I had just taken a job in San Diego, which meant that we were going to be long distance. After my first week in my new job, I came home to visit. Because May is such a beautiful month in Central California, we decided to spend some quality time with our beach cruisers and the bike path. '
p5191
aS'After about 2 miles, we stopped at the park for our picnic lunch. We spread out a blanket under a large tree, then Daniel began to pull out all the goodies he had packed never letting me reach into the basket myself. I remember him being particularly amorous, and as an affectionate person myself, I just soaked in the sweetness. After about an hour and a surprise visit from his brother and cousin who happened to also be out on a ride enjoying the breezy sunshine, Daniel got very quiet. He reached into the basket behind him one more time and pulled out a little forest green box and set it in my lap. A million thoughts rushed through my head, but what came out, through brimming tears, was  Shut up! If I open this and it s a pair of earrings, I m going to feel really stupid. '
p5192
aS'Daniel chuckled and just shook his head. As I opened the little green box, I saw a beautiful 1920 s antique replica that I absolutely adore. I looked up at him through my tears and his as he said,  will you be my wife? '
p5193
aS'First and foremost, we wanted our wedding to look and feel personal. It was important to me that it feel comfortable and have handmade elements, but not look too artsy-craftsy. As an assistant for Platinum Weddings by Kerrie, I have seen some beautifully lavish details and know that the sky is the limit when it comes to decor. With that and our budget in mind, I set out to create a personalized, romantic, and elegant event.  I often said that I wanted the reception to look like a dinner party that your grandmother might throw if your grandmother was incredibly classic, tasteful and romantic. '
p5194
aS'We decided on pinks, grey and gold for our color palette. I love the romance of pale pink, but also wanted to be seasonally appropriate. I decided to balance the lightness of blush pink with a slightly deeper mauve and grey in the fabrics and worked with Corinne at Panacea Flowery to bring in deep burgundy and Boudreaux in the flowers. I told Corinne that I wanted nothing to feel structured; I wanted every centerpiece and bouquet to feel wild and organic with lots of greenery and freedom. She delivered beautifully!'
p5195
aS' For over a year, I collected interesting pieces to use as vases and centerpiece items. I incorporated vintage bottles, my grandmother s teacup collection, books that were painted gold and a lot of mercury glass elements to elevate the elegance. All of the mismatched  girly  items were grounded by dark grey linens that brought a moodiness to the reception area. For the head table, I wanted mismatched chairs, but not in an overly rustic way. Daniel and I spent countless hours scouring thrift stores for chairs that could be repurposed. After we found chairs with lines that we loved, we sanded, painted, glazed, and reupholstered them for our wedding party and their guests. '
p5196
aS'I wanted my bridesmaids to feel beautiful and love what they wore so I gave them a color and let them run with it. For the guys, we wanted to make sure that no one had to go out and buy a brand new suit on our behalf and the thought of rentals horrified me. So we took a similar approach with the guys: we told them to wear a white shirt and grey pants, and Daniel s gift to them was the tie and suspenders that they wore. By abandoning uniformity with the bridesmaids  dresses, groomsmen attire, head table chairs, and centerpieces we really achieved a personal look and feel.'
p5197
aS'Tiber Canyon Ranch sits on 40 acres of live oak, Manzanita and olive trees and is incredibly peaceful. We were able to have the property for the entire weekend, which made set-up so much fun. Everyone was involved in hanging chandeliers, setting up chairs, and candles. This helped to keep costs down and also gave us so many special memories.'
p5198
aS'My advice is to consider abandoning the way things have always been. I am somewhat of a traditionalist, but never did anything because  that s just what you do.  Simply take a moment to stop and think about the decisions you re making and really reflect on why. Have you chosen $400 bridesmaids dresses at a bridal shop because  that s what people do  or do you really, with all your heart, love them and can t imagine your girls in anything else? Thoughtfulness will translate into a very beautiful, meaningful, and special event.'

S'If this beautiful Bride walked into the SMP offices, I m pretty darn sure we would all become immediate besties. With her love for all things sparkly, need for chandeliers and her crafty yet curated approach to her big day, she is most definitely a girl after our own heart. And it will only take one peek at all the pretty planned by Intertwined Events (with stunning florals from Stephanie Grace Designs) and captured by Christopher Todd Studios to see why. See it all here.'
p5227
aS'From the Bride After a perfect proposal on the day before New Years Eve 2013, I knew that 2013 would be not only the year of my wedding, but also of planning, dreaming, fantasizing and endlessly romanticizing our perfect day. Indeed, 2013 was the year of the SMP Homepage, the bedroom floor of magazines and rip outs, OCD pinteresting, a DVR consistantly 97% full of  4 Weddings  episodes, and paying homage to the wedding goddesses: Emily Post and Mindy Weiss. Two of my bridesmaids had also recently gotten engaged and we, along with several other friends were, simultaneously planning our dream days.'
p5228
aS'When asked my vendors what I envisioned for my wedding day, I found myself at a loss for words to what I envisioned. Whimsical, but not to Alice and Wonderland-ish, sparkly but NO glitter, romantic without being sappy, quirky without being flat out right strange. I had no way to describe it   except that I wanted it to be different than any other wedding I had ever been to. I wanted it to be all outside, no standard round centerpieces, no stuffy bridesmaids dresses- and most importantly, I wanted it to be a day that my future husband and I would look back on as simply perfect and have lots of chandeliers!'
p5229
aS'After taking suggestions from my friends based on my jumbled vision, I came across Serra Plaza and the rest essentially fell into place. Other than not knowing how to describe it (it is an office park turned amazing wedding venue on the weekends), it was the perfect setting that was equally unique, open, and the perfect neutral but elegant canvas on which to express my vision of the perfect wedding. With the venue locked in, the scrambled vision began to take its form.'
p5230
aS'I m not sure if I was driven by madness, my love of crafts, or just plain German cheapness, but my fiance and I found ourselves doing a fair amount of DIY. Having a graphic design background, he painstakingly crafted every piece of paper from the invitation (and it s many pieces), to the program, to the menu and everything in between. Between the paper details, me spending hour upon hour of hand-crippling faux-ligraphy for the invitations, it proved to be well worth the effort and an excellent bonding experience (with  conflict-resolution  skills as an added bonus!). The bonds of DIY also extended to our mothers who reveled in helping us pick out pictures for each of the 22 tables where the table number matched our age (which ended up looking a slightly questionable on some tables seeing as how we are almost 4 years apart in age!).'
p5231
aS'When September 15 had arrived, we felt that we had assembled the dream team of well-researched vendors (all of whom I would whole heartedly suggest if you are in Southern California) and it truly felt like the perfect day. Although it was a logistical  challenge  (to say the least), we couldn t resist the allure of the San Juan Capistrano Mission to do our first look and bridal party pictures- which proved to be well worth the headache! We all jumped into a van rented and driven by my father and headed back to Serra Plaza for the rest of the ceremony and reception.'
p5232
aS'From my loving family, to supportive bridal party, the day was filled with nothing but joy and love   the perfect beginning to our happily ever after!\n'

S'Whimsical weddings are a beautiful thing, especially when combined with vibrant colors and a gorgeous backyard setting.  The team at Flour And Flower Designs went above and beyond with one stellar detail after another (think baskets of florals and yummy cookies) and every last magical moment was captured by Ashlee Raubach Photography.  You know what that means?  One seriously stunning gallery.  Join me there for more.'
p5268
aS'From Flour and Flower Designs  This was no regular reception for blue-eyed bride Natalie and her groom PJ. From the very beginning of their engagement we knew this would be no ordinary wedding. It was more like a barn-raising than a wedding reception, as loved ones and family came together and celebrated these two and their commitment to love and each other. There couldn t be more detail packed into their perfect day. Everything the bride chose for her reception had special meaning and value attached. From the generations-old family recipes pinned on the chicken wire frames to the hand-embroidered tea towels by the honey favors, every aspect that caught the eye reminded their guests why they were there   to celebrate PJ and Natalie, love and family.'
p5269
aS'The whole day was captured by Ashlee Raubach   one of our absolute favorite photographers. She is one of those talents that not only takes phenomenal pictures but has a gift in bringing out the personality of her subjects. There was no exception for PJ and Natalie s shoot. There couldn t be a better representation of the couple than her photos of PJ and Natalie walking in the bare foothills of Southern California: Natalie holding eggs (she raises chickens), PJ holding her pale pink dress up as they walked so it didn t get dusty, and the two stopping mid-shoot (while assistants held reflectors and family members trudged along with props and extra clothes) to admire the small caterpillar that they found along their trail. It is just so perfectly them, captured perfectly by Ashlee.'
p5270
aS' As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Natalie and PJ married in the Newport Beach Temple and the reception was held in Natalie s parents  backyard in nearby San Clemente. There just was no other place that reflected the couple better. A ballroom dripping in crystals is not who they are. They are all about one another, who they are together and how grateful they are for everyone who loves and supports them along their way. That is what Natalie wanted to reflect in her reception. We could not get her to pick a theme or even settle on a color scheme (she knew she wanted orange), she simply wanted a feeling. So we went about to create that   feeling.'
p5271
aS' We discovered that Natalie loves to quilt, and she showed us the smooth worn hand-stiched seams that a pioneer relative had sewn more than a 100 years ago. So we pulled out all the old quilts that her family had collected that represented warmth and enduring commitment. The groom s great aunt graciously let us haul her antique buffet to the site to use as the cake/pie table where we strung his great-great grandmother s wedding napkins that she had brought with her from Holland when she immigrated to Canada. The small octagon honey jar favors we made contained pure Tupelo Honey, which can only be found in NW Florida where PJ served a full-time Mission for the LDS Church. We displayed the 300 mini jars on Natalie s old-fashioned armoire that we moved downstairs and outside into the courtyard for the day.'
p5272
aS'Natalie wanted everything bright and colorful with an organic earthy feel. She did not want cookie-cutter table toppers that copied one another. We used chocolate brown floor length table covers topped with a truly rustic burlap runner. We created centerpieces from crates of rich produce and flowers. Some guest tables had dark stained wood boxes filled with artichokes and colorful produce and others had worm-wood framing milk and mercury glass containers filled with simple flowers like Circus Roses, Stock and Queen Anne s Lace. We made sure to represent Natalie and her horticulture background (she is getting her degree in Landscape Management) on the centerpieces with small terracotta pots filled with herbs and (here comes our favorite table detail ) we hand punched small tin plant markers that said  PJ & Nattie.   Too dang cute.'
p5273
aS'As desserts is one of the things that we do best, we whipped up over 1200 of the couples favorite mini-desserts, including the groom s all-time favorite sumptuous maple cupcakes, mini lavender-vanilla cakes, super-yummy lemon tarts made with the Kate s (the bride s mom) curd that she made fresh the day before. We also made special olliaberry tarts (from Natalie s favorite place in northern California where the couple honeymooned) and to-die-for chocolate coconut cakes with toasted merengue tips. But, the biggest hit on the dessert table was by far the strawberry shortcakes in a jar with the wooden spoons tied on with colorful baker s twine. We made these especially for the bride s father, Mark, who along with the other 300 guests absolutely LOVED them. (They were the first to go.)'
p5274
aS' Cookies! We also wanted to make sure the guests were pumped full of sweetness at every turn and who doesn t love homemade cookies? So many people who loved the couple wanted to contribute to their special day and this was the perfect way. Ann Myer, family friend to both the bride and groom made her famous (and for good reason) double chocolate cookies. We made PJ s favorite peanut butter cookies complete with fork crosshatch marks and other favorites like frosted sugar cookie hearts and chocolate chip. The vintage copper tub was so truly vintage that we had to line it with plastic to be sure it wouldn t leak to keep the milk icy cold, but it looked so gorgeous on the cookie table filled with the old-fashioned milk bottles and their guests loved it. We made a bunting from the couples engagement photos and crisscrossed it against the old paned window we found.'
p5275
aS'Beyond all our professional planning and preparation, months of thrift shopping, collecting and the hundreds of texts and emails (the couple lives in Utah) the most meaningful part of the day was to see all the women who came together and provided the extra love and detail beyond what a hired hand can do. It was truly heart warming, and ultimately defined the whole event, to see those who love the bride and groom make something even more than all it s amazingly executed details separately. The loving hands that stacked the honey on the shelf, and another friend on her knees (in her dress) arranging the potted flowers under the cookie table so it looked perfect impacted more than just decor. We sat for hours with sisters and friends of the couple who helped us bring our vision for Natalie and PJ together at every level  tucking snippets of rosemary from the garden into the burlap wrapped napkins, fishing stray leaves from the pool before other guests arrived, cleaning up after us as we scurried around creating, they cheerfully set up tables, washed dishes, and so much more.'
p5276
aS'The whole experience was more than what can even be described. As much as we would like to say it was purely our professional expertise and experience as wedding planners -florist and baker- it is really more than that. It was the families and people who love Natalie and PJ that created that feeling that the bride ultimately wanted when she set out to describe the wedding she wanted all those months ago  and everyone, especially the bride and groom, felt it: Happy!'

We love the pops of burgundy in Flower Allie s arrangements and the textured fondant cake from Sweet and Saucy. You can also find more of Krista Mason s equally captivating photos of the event here.'
p5319
aS'From At Your Door Events  The very first inspiration image Shantell shared with me was that iconic shot of Kate Moss on her wedding day. You know   the one where Kate is smiling in a lush garden setting surrounded by children dressed in all ivory with romantic floral crowns?? She said,  thats what I want.  And from there we got started! I instantly knew where her head (and her heart) were. Shantell and Rex have 5 gorgeous children all under the age of 10. For Shantell   the design of the wedding was more about who she would be surrounding her on her wedding day and the joy Rex and her children brought to her. We kept our color palate very romantic using soft tones of ivory, gold, taupe, champagne, blush and deep burgundy for contrast. The overall look had some victorian and rustic influences. The guest tables were layered with texture! Our base linen was a Sultry Beige Peau de Soie Stain layered under a Champagne pearl sequin overlay by Glow Concepts and Fine linen. Over that, we place gold beaded glass chargers that served as a base for the personalized menus which were printed to show the guest s name and their specific menu selection. Antique gold mirrors framed the base of each centerpiece which were beautifully designed by Flower Allie. We alternated tall gold candelabras with low arrangements in pewter and mercury glass urns. The sweetheart table was positioned under (1 of 5 crystal chandeliers), which we covered in lush florals to help frame the bride and groom. To provide some contrast to the guest tables, we opted for a rich burgundy taffeta overlay, underneath   Glow Concepts created a dramatic waterfall bustle topped with several gold cymbidium brooches. Antique throne-like chairs by Found Vintage Rentals provided and extra element of grander. As a special touch and a gift for the bride and groom I provided antique china dinnerware and gold flatware by Dish Wish. With all the incredible details that Shantell and Rex created for their guests I wanted to make sure that their first meal together as husband and wife was just extra special. The stunning wedding cake by Sweet & Saucy Shop had a milk glass knobby texture over the surface and covered in dramatic sugar flowers in a cascade design. AND   it tasted ahhhmazing! Shantell and Rex are the true definition of what family is all about. Because of their love and dedication to each other   orchestrating the design and planning of their wedding was just a pleasure and an honor. Thankfully we had the incredible talent of Krista Mason Photography to capture every detail! '

You see, this is a wedding that totally bends all the rules, and I couldn t love it more for doing so. Complete with circus performers and gorgeous styling, this gallery is the definition of fabulous. See it all here. '

aS'From the Bride James and I entertain all day in our professions, so we wanted to take a day to relax and put our feet up and be entertained ourselves. Since my ideal career would have been to join the circus, that was our first thought  Let s fly in the circus! Contortionists, aerialist, stilts, the whole show! As entertainment was our main focus, we chose the perfect venue, the Exploratorium, so all guests could play hands on with science experiments and never be bored. Gorgeous Esther Anaya, flew in to share with us her talent of playing the electric violin to bring some live music to our ceremony as well as compliment the DJ . We met the gifted Sam Johnson on the streets of San Francisco, and he graced us with his uncanny John Mayer sounding voice as he charismatically entertained during cocktail hour and performed our first dance song. Surprisingly, even though it was very entertainment driven, I expected other parts of the wedding to take a back seat, they didn t, we got compliments left and right that it was the best wedding food many of the guest ever had!'
p5368
aS'We started planning very eccentric, but in the end the wedding was decorated very classically. James and I are inspired by innovation and progress so the Exploratorium was a perfect setting, with charming touches like actual vintage postcards from the Panama Pacific Exposition in 1915 for our place cards, and for centerpieces we found old antiques such as gramophones, and railroad lanterns. An actual vintage typewriter I had sent from England was another vintage touch that complimented our telegram save the dates, while guest typed out their well wishes to us, hilarious honeymoon reading material by the way! Cotton Candy machines and specialty his/her Ringmaster/ Diving Doll drinks on a smoking chemistry lab bar were fun as well.'
p5369
aS'My advice:\n 1) Hire a wedding planner. Best decision I made. I truly had the most amazing stress free day. The day was relaxed, and so slow, I got to enjoy every single second of it and really soak it in. I sat and played the piano for hours and reflected while someone else ran around solving problems.\n 2) I didn t want a videographer but my patient recommended Cloudless to us, and I figured, well we do have a very active, movement based wedding, I ll give it a shot. Boy  amazing decision, it is a video you can relive over and over and to have moving pictures of the most amazing day, that for many couples is over in the blink of an eye, a video helps that day last forever.\n 3) Make choices that satisfy you and your partner. In the end, this is your day, yes of course be kind and courteous to others opinions, but choose a photographer that shares your artistic style as you ll look at those picture for decades, choose the dress you feel stunning in, choose the people you want standing by your side, be true to the two of you and take the time to enjoy this amazing time in your lives.\n 4) Oh  consider doing a boudoir shot with onelove photography and presenting it to your groom as your gift, it is a fun day for you filled with pampering and feeling sexy and it is certainly something that your partner will enjoy for years to come.'
p5370
aS'Highlight of the day:To finally marry the love of my life after 10 years was the best highlight. To walk down the aisle and see his soul and face knowing with 100% of my being that I found the perfect partner for me was momentous. To have his South African family here to celebrate, to have my Hong Kong family here and our dearest and nearest to witness our commitment to each other was a dream come true. Then to celebrate afterwards at the most amazing reception was icing on the cake. We were fortunate enough to seal our wedding time with a honeymoon in Bora Bora, aka  heaven on this planet. If you have the chance to ever get there in this lifetime, you will be the luckiest most grateful person ever! I thank everyone who participated in creating the most remarkable memories for me and James.\n'

S'I m truly convinced that dining beneath the stars is the only way to celebrate your big day.  That is, if you are lucky enough to live in the always-amazing California, where sunshine and gorgeous weather reign supreme.  And if you add some sweet DIY details and an amazing locale (see: stunning private residence) to all of the aforementioned, it s a gallery of pure pretty.  See it all captured by Kevin Le Vu right here.'
p5403
aS'From Kevin Le Vu Photography  Amy and Jason tied the knot a couple of weeks before the new year on December 22, 2013. Their wedding ceremony and reception took place at a private estate in Rancho Mirage, CA called Solomon Estate. The property was elegant, gorgeous, and luxurious   basically all the key features in what Amy and Jason were looking for. While Southern California doesn t get too cold, the average winter ranges around 67 degrees; however in Rancho Mirage the weather was surprisingly perfect at 77 degrees. It felt like summer, which made their outdoor wedding one of our favorites for December! '
p5404
aS'Clear skies with a view of San Gregornio Mountains as their backdrop, nothing beats a short getaway from Orange County. The entire wedding was decorated by Amy s family including their wedding party. They were inspired by blogs and Pinterest. The overall wedding was intimate and emotional since the majority of guests were family and close relatives. It wasn t our typical wedding since there was no first dance, or father and mother dance. A mostly open mic allowed all the important people in their lives to share their love and gratitude. They ended their wedding with a bubble exit and flew off to Bora Bora.'

Ladies and gents like these two who aren t afraid to bend the rules when it comes to their wedding - which ultimately leads to some of the coolest parties ever to grace the pages of SMP. This f te is the perfect example. It s intimate dinner party meets meaningful nuptials all planned to perfection by Nira Luna of Amber Events and captured beautifully by Valerie Noel - leaving us with a gallery too good to miss.'

aS'From the Bride Rob and I knew we wanted to have an intimate and fun wedding, and we wanted it to be as stress free as possible, enter Nira from Amber Events! We live in New York, so planning a wedding cross country was a daunting task, but with Nira s help and my mom and best friends we were able to put together a truly special day. Rob and I fell in love with the Smog Shoppe because it was an awesome combination of industrial elements mixed with the beautiful succulent garden and a Vintage flair- it felt like us! The whole theme of the wedding was combining things that on paper aren t supposed to go together like burlap and lace and succulents and roses. My mother started collecting old tins and tea pots and our incredible florist Gilly filled them with yellow flowers and succulents that were in season. Our ceremony was very special and non traditional, our officiants were my brother and Rob s step mother and we wrote the whole thing ourselves, including many different traditions as possible. We stood under a chuppah made by one of my bridesmaids out of old and handkerchiefs and remembrances given to us from our families. We wanted our guests to feel like they were at our home for a back yard bbq so the food had to be great! Heirloom more than delivered, we had burgers and tacos and farmers market fresh salads. Neither Rob or I have ever liked cake but we love pie, so we got a variety of incredible pies from Porch Pies and decorated them with fun novelty cake toppers. The band was very important to Rob since he is a musician himself (we met at one of his gigs) and Nira suggested Dustbowl Revival- an great bluegrass/rock and roll band based in LA- they were so good that a few of our guests went to see them play the following night! We tried to incorporate as many fun details as possible, vintage fans to use during the ceremony in case it was hot and yellow and green pashminas for when the sun went down. We had an old fashioned photo booth and used that for our guest book. And we also made wedding mad libs which were so much fun to read later. Our wedding ended up being everything we wanted, intimate and fun and a great party!\n'

p5503
aS'From the Bride  The most important element that Scott and I focused on when planning our wedding was that it be a reflection of us. We met at a concert in 2008, and music has always been a large part of who we are and what we do. We envisioned our wedding as casually elegant, and we wanted the rock-and-roll moments to be just as memorable as the romantic moments. With the help of our families, our friends, our wonderful vendors, our coordinator Courtney Cargile, and the blank palate of Cornerstone Gardens, we were able to achieve the wedding of our dreams.'
p5504
aS'Our friends and families (200 in total) came from both coasts to celebrate our wedding weekend. We d planned fun events throughout the weekend, like a Welcome Party with our friend s band and a Sonoma Wine Tour to some of our favorite Carneros wineries, so by the time the wedding day came, we d already gotten to see the majority of our guests in a casual, pre-wedding setting! I recall walking down the aisle on the Vineyard Lawn and feeling (along with jitters) an incredible sense of peace at being surrounded by our dearest loved ones. It also gave me comfort that my bouquet was hand-tied with the sleeve of my mom s wedding dress and accented with my late grandmother s brooch. We were married under a lush green floral arch by one of our dearest friends and spiritual mentors, Jonathan Pofsky. At cocktail hour, the scene was set by a grooving jazz trio, while our guests explored the unique landscape art exhibitions around the property, or played lawn games, while nibbling on delicious hors d oeuvres served by Alex s Catering.'
p5505
aS'Guided by their ticket stub escort cards, which were posted on the  Will Call  board, our guests then made their way to the dining tent, where they were seated at tables named after our favorite music venues. Under the tent, we delivered bursts of color through varying table designs in jewel tones of green, turquoise, and yellow, and a handmade  flower  arrangement hanging from the rafters. Back at the barn, our vision of turning it from a dance floor into a concert venue (inspired by the legendary Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco) was fully realized. The raised wooden stage, the chandeliers, the lounge seating, the dramatic lighting and, of course, the incredible band and our non-stop dancing guests, all contributed to our vision. In an effort to bring our love of concerts to our wedding dance party, we adorned the barn walls with our favorite posters from our personal collection, a la the Fillmore s historic Poster Room.'
p5506
aS'I am very fortunate to have an incredibly talented graphic designer as one of my best friends (and one of my bridesmaids)  Krissy Daily and I had a blast designing the unique elements of our wedding. Krissy created our signature J&S music notes logo, as well as the full invitation suite, which we then letterpressed ourselves in Reb Peters Press s Oakland studio. And we didn t stop there . many other elements of our wedding weekend were touched by Krissy s brilliant designs, as well as contributions from my incredibly creative mother and sister. One of my favorite touches was a gift from my sister, a 60 s-inspired concert poster for our wedding day, which hung prominently above the dessert station in the barn. By the time the lights went down after a powerful encore of the Rolling Stones   Shine a Light , we truly felt like the stars of the show, fully enveloped in love and music, and setting the stage for our new life ahead.'

This Paradise Springs beauty designed by Southern Belle Events and captured by Geoff Duncan. The best part is that it was as personal as it was pretty, and you can see every gorgeous moment here.'
p5567
aS'From the Bride You can t have a great wedding without a great love story. Of all places, Matt, from New Zealand, and Ashley, from Texas, meet in Spain.'
p5568
aS'As the story goes, my girlfriends dragged me out for a night on the town against my wishes. During a quick stop at our favourite local pub, I was introduced to a table full of kiwi blokes and there happened to be just one empty seat, right next to Matt. Three months and a cancelled flight home later, not knowing if we would meet again, we were forced to part ways as Matt set off to work as a sail maker on an around the world sailing campaign. Luckily, several months later, I took matters into my own hands. Matt was in Brazil for work and on the rare occasion of a day off, was standing outside of the hotel with his work mates ready for a day of sightseeing. Much to his (and everyone else s surprise) I popped out of a cab and yelled,  surprise!  Before we knew it, the months of tears, flights,  hellos  and  goodbyes  had turned into three years and a once-in-a-lifetime love. Finally, with a one-way ticket in hand, I boarded a flight and moved to New Zealand.'
p5569
aS'After five years and countless miles, we finally acknowledged, that sometimes when you know, you just know. Matt was sneaky and pulled off a surprise proposal at the beach near his parents  house in New Zealand (I seriously had no idea and sadly was wearing yoga pants with a ketchup stain!). We wandered down to the beach, climbing out onto the rocks that overlook the snow-capped peaks of the South Island. While I was taking in the breathtaking view, Matt got down on one knee. At first, I thought he was tying his shoe because he wasn t saying anything! Once he managed to pop the question, we celebrated on the beach with a bottle of bubbly he had hidden earlier in the day (complete with proper champagne glasses this boy knows me too well!). Matt was smart enough to know that I have a very distinct sense of style and rather than propose with a ring I may or may not like, he popped the question with stunning pearl and diamond earrings and a strawberry ring pop. Once back in the States, I was able to work with a jeweler to design the perfect engagement and wedding rings. Sadly, Matt was due for work in the US the day after he proposed and again we were forced to part ways and spent the first month and a half of our engagement apart.'
p5570
aS'Due to Matt s hectic work schedule, we had to quickly make the decision of whether to try and plan an international wedding in five months or to wait a year and a half. Always up for a challenge, we opted for five months and quickly set about finding a venue and checking off all of the other items on those silly wedding planning checklists that were supposed to have already happened. As many of our guests would be flying in from New Zealand, we tried to pick a venue that was near either San Francisco or LA (since you can fly direct from NZ). After a lot of research, we zoned in on Yosemite National Park. Although there are beautiful hotels within the park that do weddings, we weren t happy with the wedding mill model,  you pay us $XXXXX and then we do your whole wedding and you have X number of hours before we shut down your party.  We were inviting guests from seven countries and nine states; we wanted them to have an extraordinary time, have the ability to get to know one another and have the opportunity to spend time with each person and convey how important they are in our lives there was no way we were going to be able to accomplish this in a wedding mill!'
p5571
aS' And then we found Paradise Springs. Knowing the time on the checklist had long since passed for  book your wedding venue,  I emailed them with a hope and a prayer to see if our date was available. Apparently, God was listening because I quickly got an email back saying they had just had a cancellation for our weekend! We ended up booking Paradise Springs for four days, giving us ample time to relax with our guests and for our family and friends from all corners of the world to get to know each other. Paradise Springs is a stunning location, set on one hundred secluded acres about a ten minute drive outside of the south gate of Yosemite National Park. With their beautiful cabins, lodge and public areas, almost all of our guests were able to stay on the property and just hang out.'
p5572
aS'With the perfect venue secured, we set about planning the remainder of our wedding, always keeping at the front of our minds that this is so much more than our wedding, but it is the only time in our lives that I will be able to have all of my friends and family, from Texas and New Zealand, in one place. With that in focus, we wanted to make sure that every detail was personalized and each person would leave the weekend knowing how important they are to us and how much we value our relationship with them. Although the visual theme of our wedding may have been a mix of traditional/elegant/gold/silver/rose gold/vintage/organic/nature/etc., the real theme of our wedding was love and relationship we wanted to focus not only on our love for each other but to express to our family and friends that our love for them never changes regardless of the distance between us. We did our very best to highlight this in our d cor (using family heirloom silver, my great grandmother s chair, displaying a wall of our travel photos, using family recipes for the cookie bar, homemade jam as wedding favours, etc.) and in all of the little details (our wedding programs included a picture and bio of each guest attending, not just the wedding party; the seating cards had hand written messages to each guest; after the wedding, our thank you cards to each guest included a picture of us holding a sign that said,  thank you ______  while doing the activity they gave us from our honeymoon registry; etc.).'
p5573
aS'Every wedding has the stress that goes along with planning it; with five months to make our dream day a reality and so many travel plans included, ours was no different. Unfortunatley we had a few extras thrown in. First, were the devastating forest fires in Yosemite. We tried to ignore all of the press on TV, but we knew it was bad when NASA showed a picture of the fire from space! All in all, the devastation spread over 400 square miles and fire ecologists have said the damage is unprecedented and that,  fire has not left such a contiguous moonscape in the Sierra since before the Little Ice Age, which began in 1350.  Once the fires died down we thought we were in the clear, just to have the government shut down, shutting down all of the national parks with it. We were very lucky that our actual venue, Paradise Springs, was just outside of the park gates, meaning that our actual wedding ceremony and reception would not be impacted. Unfortunately, we had guests coming in from all over with travel plans heavily revolved around spending a lot of time in the park. Plus, we had hired our amazing photographer, Geoff Duncan, to do a day after shoot in the park. The wedding day came and went, and the park was still shut so what do you do why sneak into the park of course! Back in our wedding clothes and with our super-stealth photographer, we snuck into the park and had our day after session anyway. Seriously though who s going to mess with a girl in a wedding dress?!?'
p5574
aS'With such a short time frame we were definitely on a tight budget! The one thing we refused to compromise on was photography. We pulled that money straight from the budget and then made all of our other decisions from there. Instead of splurging on my dream Valentino wedding shoes, I wore a pair I already had (they really were perfect, rose-gold peep toe pumps), and I just added a pair of beautiful broaches to them. Both the bridesmaids and myself did all of our own hair and makeup. Rather than going and finding  bridesmaid  dresses, which instantly adds $$$ to the tag, I hired a dressmaker in China to make the fabulous sequined dresses the girls wore. They were only $99 each! I will say, the most impressive way we saved money was Matt s idea. As the big day drew closer we realized that we didn t have enough money left over for a band or DJ. We both love music, so Matt got creative and posted an ad on Craig s List saying that we were on the hunt for an up and coming act who needed some reviews to help build their business. DJ Jaynotic responded and said he loved weddings and young love and would be happy to DJ our wedding for the cost of gas to the venue. We listened to some of his work on Sound Hound and took him up on the offer. He had all of the gear: speakers, mixing boards, lights, etc., and did a fabulous job everyone was on the dance floor having a blast! A nugget of wisdom I offer to those planning their weddings now don t be afraid to ask. Because Matt asked, we ended up with an amazing DJ almost for free. With our caterer, I wasn t happy with the first few menu options they sent over I m not a boring chicken picaata kind of bride. We wanted something unique and different, so we asked to speak with the chef directly. He and I clicked instantly as we both love experimenting with food and flavours. After our chat, he took $10 off per person, and changed out the typical wedding chicken picatta with delicious New Zealand lamb.'

aS'Since we come from different backgrounds and different cultures, it was important that we use both the NZ and US wedding traditions we wanted our American friends to get a taste of NZ and our New Zealand friends to get a taste of the South! With that in mind, we decided to have both a rehearsal dinner (US tradition) and a post-wedding brunch (NZ tradition). I love to cook and have big parties. Although I ve tried to recreate Texas BBQ in NZ, it just isn t possible (no smoker, no brisket) and there is no local food that compares. For our rehearsal dinner we threw a low key Texas BBQ, complete with smoked brisket(!), coleslaw, yellow potato salad, cornbread and a whole lot of BBQ sauce. To give our Kiwi friends the full experience, we played country music and had s mores over the fire pit. For brunch the morning after the wedding, we did a typical NZ picnic, complete with picnic baskets overflowing with fresh bread, cured meats, olives, cheeses and more. We hiked down to Hidden Pond yes, I hiked in heels and a ball gown if you can  wear a ball gown to a picnic the day after your wedding, then when can you wear a ball gown to a picnic!? After the picnic we relaxed in the sun playing croquet and petanque/bocce ball. (P.s. I found the ball gown, brand new, on sale for $19.99!!)'
p5576
aS'On the wedding day, we were also able to incorporate both cultures  traditions. With our Maid of Honour, Best Man and Pastor, we followed the New Zealand tradition and signed the marriage certificate during the actual wedding ceremony. During the reception, we had a close, and very funny friend serve as our MC, instead of the DJ as is common in the States. We followed the US tradition of the cake cutting, and rather than just slicing the cake as the do in NZ, we sliced it and fed it to each other and to make sure the Kiwis got the full American experience, I smeared it all over Matt s face! Lastly, and one of my favorite parts of the night, was speeches. In America we have  speeches,  but they are generally more of a toast. A few kind words to the couple, maybe a funny story from the best man, but the goal, from the speech-giver s perspective, is to get in and out as quickly as possible. In New Zealand, wedding speeches go on throughout much of dinner and are given by the Father of the Bride, Father of the Groom, Best Man, Maid of Honour, Groom and typically a handful of other people. More often than not, they go on for several minutes with in depth stories and memories of the bride or groom, the couple and then finish with a toast. It was so fun at our wedding to hear the stories our friends and family told of us through the years, what some of their favorite memories are, and to hear how they have seen us grow throughout our relationship. There were definitely a lot of laughs hearing the embarrassing stories of the American sayings I use in NZ that have very different meanings and there were a lot of tears when either of our parents spoke.'
p5577
aS'Since the wedding, Matt and I have sat around and talked, trying to figure out what our favorite moment from the night was. Speeches are near the top of the list, but I think what we loved most about the day, and the weekend, was how everything was personalized and that all of our friends and family were included and recognized in our big day. My young adult pastor from years ago, who I am very close with, was able to fly out, perform our ceremony and hang out for the whole weekend. It was so special to have him there as he has been a huge part of my spiritual life and who I am today. During the ceremony, when he was telling everyone how we knew each other and all of the crazy adventures we ve been on, he teared up and had to stop for a moment. It meant so much to us and our families knowing that the person who was leading us into this next chapter of our lives cared so much for me and for Matt and I s relationship.'
p5578
aS'Even with the little details, we tried our hardest to keep everything very personal and make everyone feel involved. Rather than splashing out for dance lessons, our close friends, who happen to be professional ballroom dancers, gave us a lesson at home. It was so fun after our first dance to rush off the dance floor, giving them high-fives and seeing their smile knowing that they contributed to our day. For our nibbles on the table before dinner, we served truffled popcorn Matt LOVES popcorn and I m slightly obsessed with anything truffle. The day before our wedding, all of our friends and family at the venue pitched in and helped to make all of the cookies for our Milk & Cookie Bar. Rather than the tried and true unity candle/sand tradition, we came up with the idea for a  unity canvas.  We both love art, so we found a beautiful wooden canvas that we stained to match our house. We covered the canvas with a custom created monogram decal; during the ceremony, we painted the canvas with gold and silver paint. Once the stencil was removed, we had a beautiful piece of artwork to hang in our house.'
p5579
aS'In addition to speeches, and all of the personal touches, another favorite moment of the wedding, was all of our guests gathered around the heaters surrounding the dance floor, trying to keep warm, talking and sharing stories. We had been told that October is one of the warmest and nicest months of the year in Yosemite. The day that we arrived at the venue to set up, it was snowing! Luckily, we have some very smart friends who are in the process of setting up a company called Wedding Weather, whose team of meteorologists sends detailed weather reports leading up to the big day. Even though everyone was freaking out that we would need to move everything inside, we knew that the weather was going to clear for ceremony and reception. Wedding Weather definitely saved a lot of stress and made the setup way more enjoyable! Even with the clear skies, it was still freezing outside. In order to combat the cold, the boys wore long johns under their suits and my bridesmaids wore yoga tights under their dresses. Although it was cold, we think it made our wedding more social. Everyone put on their beer coat, got out on the dance floor or chatted around the heaters, and had blast and getting to know each other better.'
p5580
aS'After the honeymoon was over, and the pictures came in, we ve been reflecting over the whirlwind of the past few months. Seeing all of the little details that we put so much thought into, seeing the smile on our guests  faces, and seeing our love for each other that so obviously shines through the photos, there isn t a thing we would change. (Well, maybe the napkins, but there s always one silly thing you would change!). A few words of wisdom for those planning now: Don t be afraid to work outside of the box and do what works for you and your event, regardless of what  Dear Abby  says we emailed our save the dates, did an online RSVP and registered for our honeymoon as we wouldn t be able to get gifts back from the US to NZ. The quicker you plan your event, the less money you will spend on frivolous things you don t need. Hire the best photographer that you can afford, even it if means cutting the budget in other areas. (We have ZERO regrets about this!!) Lastly, and most obviously, don t lose sight of what this day is about it s not about competing with the events you see on Pinterest or blogs, but about celebrating your love and relationship with your fianc  and honoring your family and friends.'

S'Having a  top three  in the wedding planning process is so, so important and can be a really helpful jumping off point in your vision for the entire day. This adorable duo first and foremost wanted their wedding to be a  great party   so it was only fitting their top three were:  Really good food, really good wine and a live band!  With the help of the amazing Florabella team, this gorg gallery from Adriana Klas looks like a party to remember!'
p5629
aS'From Florabella  Lisa and Ted s wedding was a beautiful at-home-wedding that took place in Atherton, California with amazing wood details including the invitations, LOVE favors, table numbers, charcuterie boards, and signage done by the bride s company in Bend, Oregon   wallbedfactory.com. Previously Lisa worked for William-Sonoma which is evident in the carefully curated gift boxes designed and packaged by Lisa. Food and presentation were important elements to the wedding. Lisa worked closely with us and the caterer, McCalls Catering & Events, to develop a menu that wasn t a typical wedding dinner by adding latin-based flavors and a passed offering of ancho chili, citrus, and red onion crusted halibut served on herb spiced quinoa in a separate mini cast iron pot.'
p5630
aS'Lisa likes to do things away from the norm which is evident in her wedding dress. She knew she didn t want a white dress, so she went to Jinza to have a custom dress made of grey silk with stunning bodice detailing. Even the ceremony music had a flair of originality, mixing classical songs for the parents and bridesmaids with original renditions of country songs composed by Anna Maria Mendieta for the bridal processional and recessional. We continued the unexpected with the decor by building the tent to include the garden inside, so the trees were surrounding the tables and the clear top showed the full moon at night. We wanted to bring the outside in and keep the woodsy feel set forth by the save the dates and invitations, so we created tall branch centerpieces in birch-wrapped vases as the table focal points, with low kale flower and fern arrangements in wood boxes as a linear element. Only slate blue and greys were added as accents to the wood and green foliage keeping the entire wedding natural and elegant.'
p5631
aS'From the beautiful Bride  I never dreamed about what my wedding day would look like, I didn t fantasize of the prince that would stand before me or imagine what the story that we shared together would be. I only knew that the day would come, that I would find love and that love would find me.'
p5632
aS'I know now that the reason I never fantasized about the details of my future is because I never could have envisioned something so perfect as this. I couldn t have dreamed of someone as amazing as Ted or of a future as bright and as wonderful as ours. Ted is the most incredible reality I could have ever imagined and I will forever cherish the life that we have together.'
p5633
aS'Shortly after we were engaged we began the wedding planning process. We sat down and talked about how we wanted our special day to go. The first thing Ted said was that he had three things that stood out as most important, No. 1: Really good food, No. 2: Really good wine, No. 3: A live band. Check, check and check   those were my top three as well!'
p5634
aS'We decided to get married at my parents  home   the home that I was born and raised in. It was incredibly special to be able to create another memory there, a memory that tops all the rest. We settled on a Memorial Day weekend backyard wedding. Our French Country Chic design theme developed with our desire to embrace the outdoor ambiance at my parents  home. We used a lot of wood and wood tones while our main colors were literally 50 shades of grey with a slate blue accent.'
p5635
aS'Isabella and her team did an amazing job turning our vision into reality. Every detail was absolutely impeccable. From the centerpieces to the charcuterie table, the table runners to the tent lighting. We wanted our guests to be comfortable while still creating an elegant atmosphere and Isabella accomplished that and so much more.'
p5636
aS'The food was magnificent, A-MAZ-ING. We came to McCalls with ideas for the menu and they took our inspiration and created a dining experience that was far beyond what we could have ever imagined. Ted and I chose the wines and we were set for a great evening.'
p5637
aS'The main thing Ted and I talked about throughout the planning process was that we wanted our wedding to be a great party   a celebration of our commitment to each other and first and foremost, a celebration of our love for family and friends. We saw it as a party for our guests and we wanted them to enjoy themselves. I think we accomplished that with the help of Isabella, our caterer, our band and most importantly, the help and support of my parents throughout the entire process.\n It is impossible for me to put into words how wonderful of a day we had. We wouldn t change a single thing. If only we could do it again this year \n'

The kind of amazing that combines the romantic, heart-fluttering poetry of Pablo Neruda with the creative genius (and images) of Lucy Munoz and a stunningly beautiful Claire Pettibone masterpiece.  I m talking al fresco romance thanks to a fab team of vendors that knows a thing or two about delivering the pretty.  See it all in the full gallery.'
p5678
aS'From Lucy Munoz  Inspired after reading love poems by Chilean born author Pablo Neruda, I decided to give some of them literal meaning by creating a world in which love is the essence of everything. His poems seem to relay the feelings of longing and the yearning desire to simply be in the presence of the person you love the most. I think you d agree that after reading some of his poems your heart tends to be caught off guard, and it almost flutters.'

Like these two animals lovers who opted for donations to their favorite shelter in lieu of  favors  or the ahh-mazing fabric ceremony backdrop handmade by the Bride and her mom. It s all these little details that add up to something truly special, and you can through the The Hearts Haven s lens right here.'

aS'The couple had personal details scattered all throughout the wedding. For the d cor, Erin and her Mom created tons of DIY details like pennant flags, patterned table overlays, wooden signage and a jaw dropping ceremony backdrop made from strips of fabric.

And shining as a true example is this beautiful day captured by Lisa Rigby Photography, a day that is sooo heartwarming and gorgeous, you ll be at a complete loss for words  believe you me.  See it all in the full gallery.'
p5765
aS'From the Bride  Our wedding was absolutely magical.  Thinking back, from the moment of our engagement through the planning process and throughout that beautiful day there is not a moment that we would change.  Having a small wedding meant that we could spend time with each and every beloved guest, and that we could invite those guests to San Ysidro Ranch, which is one of the most extraordinary places on earth.  It also meant that we could create many personal details for our day, including handmade save the dates, welcome baskets for each guest s room, and the most lovely pillows that were crafted by my mom to adorn the vintage church pews.  After the emotional ceremony, beautifully performed by our dear friend, we enjoyed cocktails and a blazing orange sunset.  In the twilight we treated our guests to a pre-dinner wine and cheese tasting under twinkling lights, followed by a delicious dinner and a wedding cake that was absolutely divine.  Looking around the table during dinner, we felt so grateful to be surrounded by loved ones, and so delighted that our dearest friends from every different phase of our lives were seated at the same table, sharing wine and telling stories.  When dinner was done, guests gathered by the fireplace for port, scotch, a moving toast, and so much laughter.  Every moment of our wedding day was filled with love, and felt so personal and intimate, so us; We are so grateful to have had such amazing vendors to help us realize this vision.  Each person brought so much of their own creativity and heart to our day   and we are filled with gratitude for all of our vendors.  We feel like they became part of our family too!'
p5766
aS'At the end of the night, we said farewell to our guests, handing each one a box of Italian wedding cookies from our favorite bakery, and embracing each guest as the boarded the Santa Barbara Trolley to head back to the hotel  but we had one more surprise in store.  After all of the guests were aboard, we climbed aboard, too!  The driver played Frank Sinatra tunes and we whisked  our guests away to experience one of our favorite Santa Barbara treats   late night ice cream at McConnell s on Mission Street!  Our guests were completely surprised and it was a perfect end to a perfect day, standing hand-in-hand, eating ice cream in our wedding finery, and watching our guests delight in their ice cream cones.'

S'Have I mentioned how much I love Napa weddings? Of course I have, and probably on more than one occasion. And my love comes from weddings like this one - where every moment just seems magical, and every detail on a new level of lovely. Andi Hatch was behind the lens to capture every gorgeous moment of this Napa Valley beauty, and you can see all the swoon-worthy moments here.'
p5812
aS'From Andi Hatch I am excited to share this lovely wedding at a private estate in Napa. This dreamy summer wedding occurred at a secret private estate in Napa which hosts only a few weddings each year. The mother of the bride found the venue on a tip from a busboy who drew a map on a paper napkin, proclaiming that when he eventually found the right girl, this is where he would marry her. It is a gorgeous venue with graceful lawns, massive oak trees, vineyards, English gardens and a guest house. A perfect location for an outdoor summer wedding in wine county, complete with rocking dance party under a giant oak tree. '
p5813
aS'From the Bride Our wedding was an absolutely magical day in the Napa Valley surrounded by our friends and family. We decided to get married at a private estate in wine country because because of its proximity to Mendocino, where both David and I grew up. We loved the idea of incorporating some traditional elegance into our garden party, and we also wanted our guests to feel relaxed and comfortable. Our venue was gorgeous, and provided the intimate yet expansive setting we had dreamed of. The ceremony took place in front of a lovely pond, shaded by ancient trees, with green lawns, fruit trees and flowers surrounding us. My father passed away suddenly a few years ago, so my mother escorted me down the aisle, and I carried a charm with my father s photo on my bouquet. David s parents escorted him down the aisle, and his nephew was our ring bearer.'
p5814
aS'A string quartet played classical music as our guests were greeted with lavender lemonade. David s cousin officiated our ceremony, which we crafted together with him. The whole ceremony was meaningful and from the heart, and there weren t too many dry eyes! Our mothers both read poems, and David s sister read a traditional hand blessing. We spent a lot of time writing our own vows, pronouncing them to each other for the first time at our wedding. Once we were announced as husband and wife, right after our first kiss, David surprised me by performing a song! He had secretly been taking voice lessons for months; you can t get more romantic than that!'

aS'During dinner, our guests sat at long white farm tables and dined on delicious farm-to-table cuisine and local wines. After dinner, we took to the dance floor for our first dance to Michael Buble s Hold On, for which we had been taking dance lessons together. The vibe was set for a very lively dance party under the stars. DJ Dan of Love in the Mix was awesome and kept everyone moving!'
p5816
aS'David and I are grateful to our families for all their support in making it a reality. Some of our fondest memories from the day were seeing our diverse group of family and friends come together and have so much fun. We are blessed to have a wonderful community of family and friends, and we only wished the day had lasted longer so that we would have had more time with everyone.'

S' A Bunch of Love  is right! This modern take on tradition in Fullerton certainly has us thoroughly charmed. Also note the cool DIY touches the couple incorporated like the aforementioned bunch of love sign and rosemary-infused olive oil for guests to take home. Having a great photographer like Anna Delores to capture it all doesn t hurt, either. You can get the full gallery here.'
p5860
aS'From Anna Delores Photography  When Jennica first e-mailed me to chat about wedding photography, I could already tell we d be a good fit, and our chemistry at the first meeting with her and David sealed the deal. I was ecstatic to work with them and shooting their engagement session at The Last Bookstore and Angel s Flight in downtown Los Angeles was the most fun I d had during a photo shoot! We were laughing pretty much nonstop, and they were open to my ideas for great photos (for which they were handsomely rewarded with a wonderful collection of diverse engagement images).'
p5861
aS'On the big day, both Jennica and David were excited about marrying each other but were also calm and happy, just enjoying the day and soaking up the joy of the occasion. They had a list of the  must have  family portraits, but for the most part the bride and groom simply wanted organic, candid moments captured in their wedding day images. My cheeks hurt from so many smiles while I was culling and editing their collection of photos.'
p5862
aS'Jennica and David are sweetly romantic (they both teared up just looking at each other during the first look, the ceremony, and the first dance) and genuinely caring, open people. Jennica and David made time to greet each beloved guest during a receiving line before the dinner buffet from Stadium Tavern was served. The love from their friends and family was tucked into every corner of their wedding celebration, including the dessert table, which was filled with baked goods prepared by their (very talented) family members and bridal party.'
p5863
aS'Their wedding day was a lovely combination of tradition (the ceremony took place at Saint Boniface Catholic Church in Anaheim) and modern-day, vintage-inspired chic details at the reception at The Villa del Sol in Fullerton. Bridesmaids selected their own dresses from a navy and grey color palette and carried bouquets that included thistle, roses, sweet pea, and plenty of greenery. Each setting at the kids  table included a coloring book, Ring Pop, and glow sticks. The lush greenery runners and floral arrangements from The Little Branch added understated but exquisite elegance to the rectangular feasting tables, and wedding planner Erin Egleston s execution of all the reception details was flawless.'
p5864
aS'There were plenty of special touches that were personal to Jennica and David, including their  Bunch of Love  light marquee (a play on the groom s last name). In lieu of a traditional guest book, friends and family filled out little cards offering advice to the bride and groom. The couple s signature drinks were Lynchburg Lemonade and a French 75, and table numbers were stamped on the covers of vintage books (a literary theme reinforced by the dessert table s book page backdrop!). Jennica and David created their own rosemary-infused olive oil favors  for guests to take home. The evening came to a reluctant close with a cigar bar and tons of enthusiastic dance moves.\n'

S'Here s a sure-fire recipe for wedding success: enlist the help of an amazing team of vendors like Intertwined Events, Kacee Geoffroy, 24 Carrots, Found Vintage Rentals and Jasmine Star.  Then pair that stellar team of superstars up with a breathtaking venue like Rancho Las Lomas and and one crazy stylish duo and, voil !  Pure, unadulterated perfection.  See it all in the full gallery.  '
p5909
aS'From Intertwined Events  Krissi and Clark s wedding was one to remember. The couple s Rancho Las Lomas wedding had the perfect combination of outdoor beauty and glam. Krissi was dressed in gorgeous Jimmy Choo s and Clark s grandmother s fur coat, while Clark dazzled in Tom Ford and Ferragamo. From a gorgeous beaded dress to a sequined sweetheart table, their wedding had elegant touches everywhere.'
p5910
aS'Before the ceremony, the gentlemen of the bridal party prayed together and spoke kind words towards the soon-to-be newlywed couple. Their pastor, who was part of Clark s life from when he was younger, personalized the entire ceremony. They also wrote their own very unique and personalized vows, which they repeated to one another. It was such a sweet and touching ceremony. The one thing that everyone will remember is their heartfelt letters to their parents. They each wrote letters, which were read out loud, to their parents, as well as each other s parents; when Krissi thanked Clark s mom for raising the man of her dreams, it s safe to say there wasn t a dry eye in the crowd.'
p5911
aS'The reception was nothing short of an epic celebration and dance party! Clark is a DJ so house music was incorporated throughout the entire day, from his song down the aisle to the dance session at the reception. The newlyweds walked in for their Grand Entrance with Spirit Animals on, while guests, who were supplied with customized glow sticks, raised their arms and danced the night away.'
p5912
aS'To ensure the champagne would keep flowing, escort cards were acrylic stir sticks that were designed by Krissi s brother. Krissi collected mercury glass containers for over a year to get enough for all the tables! They were almost 100 pieces collected in total to be sure that there would be enough to allocate an appropriate amount of sparkle and shine to the reception tables. And not to be missed, the custom cigar bar and lounge area by the fireplace allowed people to momentarily rest their feet between dance sets you couldn t keep them off the floor for long!'

S'This, loves, is exactly why navy blue and yellow happens to be one of my favorite color combinations.  It s the perfect mix of fresh and sophisticated, and when you pair it up with some of the prettiest details you will ever lay your eyes upon, it s also all sorts of amazing (I m looking at you, beautiful blooms from April Flowers).  See all of the pretty captured by Kelsey Stewart in the full gallery.  '
p5943
aS'From The Bride  Chip and I are both Southern California natives, so we wanted to celebrate our wedding in a beautiful location that gave our guests a chance to get out of town for a bit. We chose San Luis Obispo for its gorgeous landscapes, open spaces, and perfect formula of proximity and distance from our hometown. We planned our wedding to be a reflection of the love and appreciation we have for one another, but Chip and I also wanted the day to be a celebration of the amazing friends and family that supported us through nine (nine!) years of dating. This meant our number one priority was to have the night of our lives with all of our favorite people   so if something didn t fall in line with that initiative, it was quickly nixed. Simple strategy!'
p5944
aS'We found Spanish Oaks Ranch through the suggestion of my mom s cousin, and didn t waste any time in booking our date. From there, the flurry of wedding planning began! Chip and I prefer a simple, clean aesthetic with one or two funky touches for style points, and that resonated across every aspect of the wedding. We gave polka-dot ties to the groomsmen to wear with their gray suits, and I gifted a different bracelet to each of my bridesmaids, who were tasked with finding their own floor-length dresses in either navy or grey. I wore a flower made of antique lace in my hair to go with my drop-waist Nicole Miller gown, and Chip looked great in the navy 3-piece suit he had custom made.'
p5945
aS'April Flowers did a phenomenal job working with my mom and I on the flowers   she created gorgeous boquets for myself and my bridesmaids, but the thing I loved the most were the tablescapes. We opted for family-style dining (greens, salmon, tri-tip, brussel sprouts & cous cous!), so April had to balance the reality of space restrictions with my request for uneven, mixed arrangements, lots of mercury glass, and candles. It turned out even more perfectly than I had imagined it.'
p5946
aS'Aside from our families getting together to set up the dining room the day before, we were able to incorporate quite a few DIY projects, with my sister designing and printing the programs, table numbers, and place cards (they doubled as wine charms!). Our wedding favors   jars of Chip s delicious BBQ spice rub   were also homemade, and to his delight, we received multiple requests for the recipe. And, instead of a traditional guestbook, we asked friends and family to sign our old winemaking picturebook which we now leave out on our coffee table.'
p5947
aS'Our wedding day went by in a flash, but I remember reminding myself to savor as much of it as I could. The best part (aside from getting a kickass husband out of the deal) was feeling the immense love of the most important people in our lives, and watching them come together and party down in our honor. Greatest day ever!'

S'Paris is chic, no doubt. And this stylized shoot by Koman Photography certainly has us transported. The husband/wife duo teamed up with great local vendors like Bella Wedding Bridal, video editors from Jakfoto, and the brilliant bakers from Jamaica s Cakes, just to name a few! Take a peek at the bottom if you like what you see. You can find even more pictures from the shoot here.'

aS'From our Blog:'
p6016
aS'From Koman Photography  We have been envisioning how our styled wedding session would look for a long time. Finally this past summer after many discussions we decided that the only way we could bring our vision to life was by bringing together some very talented people, we like to call them our Super Hero team. And when I say  super hero  I mean  blow-your-mind-away-super-power-talents . I know that s a mouth full but those few words can t even begin to express our appreciation for these wonderful vendors. Of course John and I had big hopes when we started planning this great project, but never in our dreams did we expect so many extremely talented vendors would have the time and passion to team up with us!We could not have been happier with the outcome!'
p6017
aS'Working with this team on our special project has brought us so many great feelings of joy, excitement, happiness, hope and love. We feel so much gratitude for everyone who worked so hard and was so excited to team up with us. If I were to compare the shoot to something that I ve experienced before I would say it s kind of like planning your Wedding Day (John and I planned our Wedding from start to finish)   only a bit harder. Why? Because we feel like it is our duty to capture each and every detail that our vendors created perfectly. We only hope that we could reflect all of our appreciation for everyone s hard work through the pictures we captured.'
p6018
aS'The actual day itself was no easy task-from carrying Pretty Vintage Table s beautiful vintage pieces around Irvine Regional Park, to making sure our yummy vegan desserts and beautiful flowers from Kissingbees would stay cool and look great on a very hot Californian Fall Day. Everyone brought their A-game and worked in a very professional manner. Thank you to each and every one of you involved: from the meticulous planning, to designing, to working behind the scenes or in front of the camera! A million times thank you! We are extremely thrilled to call you our friends and we will always be grateful to your very hard work and kind-heartedness!'

S'Time and time again, we are awed by the love that unites two people together. And no matter what they endure, that love stands high above any struggle, distance or hurdle to overcome. We see it every single day and are so honored to share it here on this little  ole blog. As we celebrate Memorial Day today, and remember the men and women who fought and died for our freedom, this sweet wedding from Vis Photography and Paperback Weddings has our hearts glowing. With her Groom-to-be deployed, this stunning Bride planned their entire wedding and all it s lovely details. But their love? It s invincible.'
p6056
aS'From the beautiful Bride  We always knew we wanted a Venue that expressed us as a couple. The Condor s Nest was everything we dreamed and more. The staff made the entire process a breeze. We met as strangers and left as lifelong friends. I can t say enough good things about our experience.'
p6057
aS'Our favorite memories from the wedding: If I had to describe our wedding day in three words: Fun, romantic, surreal. Really I could go on and on about my favorite memories, but what sticks out the most is just the level of energy everyone had, the love we felt that day, our circle ceremony, epic dance party, and the heartfelt speeches. Our entire wedding party came up early that morning, and we all had a mimosa brunch together. Then the girls separated from the boys to get ready. Me and Greg had our first look before the ceremony, and that was probably the most special moment of the wedding, very private and emotional. We had our wedding party photos taking before as well so we could all enjoy cocktail hour after the ceremony. We had our ceremony seating placed in a circle around us, it was very intimate and allowed us to feel the love of everyone there   such a wonderful memory. After cocktail hour and dinner, the dancing started and I m not kidding when I say everyone was dancing from the moment the music started until the very last song. Our wedding party ended up in the pool, Greg and I included. The night went down as the most perfect night of our lives.'
p6058
aS'Our advice to those planning: Never lose sight of what your wedding day is all about. My husband was deployed during the entire planning process, and it was a constant outlet I used to feel connected to him and our love. Looking back you will never remember those small details you thought were so important. You remember the love you felt, the reason you were there, and the unforgettable moments you shared together on your special day.\n'

S'DIY touches are always sure to leave a wedding feeling intimate and personal, but there s one especially notable DIY in this wedding that has left me a little teary-eyed. The sweet Bride lovingly stitched a heart-shaped piece of t-shirt owned by a dear friend of hers who had passed away into her wedding dress, as to keep her close to her heart. If that s not just the best DIY ever, I don t know what is. See the entire love-filled gallery from JennaBeth Photography over here!'
p6098
aS'From JennaBeth Photography  Colleen and Keith s wedding was just plain gorgeous! From their shining personalities and chemistry with one another to all of Colleen s DIY elements ALL throughout the day. Everywhere you turned there was a personal touch somewhere that was done, it made their day feel like them. Some of my favorite handmade items were the cut out t-shirt of a heart that belonged to a friend of Colleen s that passed away sewn into her dress close to her heart, the handmade seating chart and to the heartfelt letter that Keith wrote to his Dad that also passed. It was such a joy to capture this day!'
p6099
aS'From the beautiful Bride  When Keith and I started planning our wedding we both quickly agreed we wanted to do something that was small and intimate, with close family and friends, but also\n something that was fun and reflected our personalities. When we found Farmstead we agreed that it featured all of the elements we wanted, rustic charm mixed with fun quirks such as a giant moose head hung above the bar. We also knew that Napa Valley would be a great destination for our guests who would be traveling from near and far. Once the venue was set the rest of the decisions fell easily into place, which left me plenty of time to focus on all of the DIYs I had envisioned. My favorites were   The chalkboard signs I made for the bridesmaids to write down how we met, the curtain the florist and I made together for the backdrop to the ceremony and the the cigar box I made for Keith as his wedding day gift.'
p6100
aS'Our wedding day was as perfect as we could have imagined. Our ceremony started an hour late due to traffic in the valley, but it was nothing a little wine and appetizers couldn t fix! Our ceremony was written by Keith and me and included many personal touches, my favorites being a Celtic hand fastening ritual as a tribute to my Irish roots and of course a wine ceremony as a nod to our wine country wedding. Our guests gathered around us under a walnut tree on church pews which made the ceremony feel even more personal and intimate. The rest of the night passed far too quickly, and consisted of dining on delicious farm to table food that none of us could get enough of, listening to amazing music performed by our talented guitarist, roasting s mores over an open fire, and dancing the night away. Looking back, there is nothing I would change for the world!\n'

S'Ever since moving to New England, I ve become obsessed with all things nautical. Stripes, shells, sea, you name it. So when this California yacht club affair popped across my screen, you better believe I was grinning ear to ear. Studio28 Photo tagged along for the ride, and the results are nothing short of stunning. Have a peek here!'
p6128
aS'From Allison of Studio28 Photo  Nicole and Adam had the perfect blend of west coast cool and east coast traditional incorporated into their nautical wedding. Her California roots and his east coast upbringing melded perfectly into a celebration that was not only stylish and chic but full of love and laughter.'
p6129
aS'Adams classic east coast style could be seen in the Vineyard and Vines bow tie and ties he and his groomsmen wore. The location, a classic yacht club on the harbor, was a nod to his roots and love of sailing. While the subtle pops of yellow that were found in the florals and decor brought to life the bright and easy attitude of the wedding, were all Nicole and her California sunshine filled upbringing. Their wedding was a perfect reflection of how two styles can create one blended vision, and a fabulous day full of love.\n'

S'Want to party into the wee hours of the night but don t want to disturb the neighbors? Simple solution: an alluring, secluded ranch. We love what couple Marisa and Luke did, mixing the rustic ranch vibe with a modern orange and gray color palate and fun details   including one rowdy photo booth (see the time-lapse video at the end).  Thanks to Ramin from The Marin Studio you can relive the fun with the full gallery here.'
p6173
aS'From the groom  To me, besides getting to work in excel spreadsheets and helping with the logistical and financial planning, simply working with Marisa throughout the process was pretty awesome.  What made it even more special was the planning of the actual ceremony.  Here we again used the talents of several friends and family members to create some personal touches as we also wanted the ceremony to be a little less traditional. Because the ceremony site was about 100 yards from the reception area and entrance to the ranch, we thought that it would be nice for all of the guests to walk down together, to meet and greet each other.  After I gave a brief speech that basically stated  we d like all of you, friends and family members, to take this journey of marriage together with us , my mom and I led a processional of all of the guests down the hill to the ceremony site, accompanied by the musical talents of some of my closest friends covering The Cars song  Just What I Needed .  After the guests were seated, the band played a cover of Iron & Wine s  Naked As We Came  as the bridesmaids came down the dusty aisle, and a cover of The Decemberists   June Hymn  while Marisa and her father made the long dramatic 100 yard walk down the hill from the stables to the ceremony site.  One of Marisa s close friends, a Hollywood writer, officiated the wedding, adding lots of personal stories and quips. Our mothers read some of our favorite passages from children s literature, and our dog Stella ran down the aisle with our rings tied to her collar when we called. At the end, the band kicked off the celebration with a fun cover of Ryan Adam s  Dance All Night  while the guests returned back up the hill for the cocktail hour, dinner and dancing.  After an amazing dinner by Michael Woodword Catering and his team, our DJ   Julian Mocine-McQueen AKA DJ Such n  Such   kept the dance floor going till nearly 2am.  Our friends from True Photobooth allowed the guests to capture the party in film strips, and later compiled a pretty sweet time lapse video of all of the craziness that went on in that photobooth.\n'

S'I ve lived in Las Vegas for almost nine years now, and never once have I met a handsome stranger at Emeril s sports bar, totally hit it off and fell in love by the end of the night.  I guess that s the kind of event that happens for a perfectly matched duo like these sweeties, a twosome that you can just tell is meant.to.be.  Their story is EPIC  and their wedding planned by SPARK Event Consulting?  Just as amazing as you think it would be.  See it all captured by John & Joseph Photography in the full gallery.'
p6223
aS'From SPARK Event Consulting  Planning sessions preparing for Whitney and Greg s wedding would typically result in my cheeks hurting and stomach aching from laughing so much after spending time together! It was the same great energy that made Whitney and Greg such an amazing couple and an obvious favorite amongst their friends and peers as displayed in the outpouring of love on their wedding day, celebrating the new Mr. and Mrs. Peyser! It was beyond my pleasure to be a part of their wedding experience and a privilege to share their story.'
p6224
aS'The bride comes from a small farming town at the southernmost end of California, while our groom grew up clear across the country in a little north shore enclave in New York. And yet, they were destined to meet one fateful March Madness weekend in the loud and busy city of Las Vegas.'
p6225
aS'For their wedding day, the couple wanted it to feel like their relationship: romantic, fun and filled with love. They chose La Costa Resort in Carlsbad and while a large resort, fell in love with an intimate lawn location with a bright bougainvillea arch and large trees with beautiful, draping branches for their ceremony. They wanted this space to look natural, simply enhancing the existing setting. Flowers ~ Annette Gomez perfectly interpreted their wishes by lining the aisle with small and large ivy topiaries and lush ficus trees mixed with blooming bougainvillea that  naturally  enhanced the open space. Rustic Spanish style lanterns also accented the aisle and hung from garlands of ivy from the tree branches. To the existing bougainvillea arch, additional blooms, topiaries, and trees, as well as warm candlelight from the lanterns were added to frame the couple at the altar. The sentimental ceremony included readings by their soon-to- be brother-in-law and Whitney s longtime family friend marrying them.'
p6226
aS'As a tribute to Whitney s farming hometown and Greg s new business venture, sprigs of lavender were used to elegantly accent the flutes of champagne welcoming guests to the cocktail reception, overlooking La Costa s expansive golf course. Inside the ballroom, dining tables displayed a mixture of tall centerpieces in gorgeous cut-crystal vases and elegant candelabras and low silver mercury footed pedestals. Artfully composed by The Vines Leaf, arrangements were filled with all of the bride s favorites, including dreamy Juliet garden roses, full-sized blush Caf  au Lait dahlias and draping ivory tulips. And LOTS and LOTS of warm candlelight romantically illuminating the ballroom. Large French doors to the side of the room led to a sprawling terrace and a lounge setup of tufted and mirrored furniture, also highlighted by candlelight and soft lighting. Just as impressive as the room d cor was the amazing wedding cake from Filigree Cakes, which our groom and his sweet tooth were MOST anxious to enjoy! Tiers of vanilla cake, Bavarian cream and fresh berries and decadent chocolate cake filled with layers of chocolate hazelnut were complemented with fresh flowers, pearl accents and the couple s monogram. And symbolically tying all the details together were the toasting glasses from Whitney s parents  wedding, displayed by the bride and groom.'
p6227
aS'The evening began with our father of the bride giving an emotionally touching speech, reflecting on special father-daughter moments he and Whitney shared together and also warmly welcoming Greg into the family. Following suit, our maid-of-honor cleverly recounted many of the youthful adventures she and Whitney shared, including the fateful trip to Las Vegas where the bride and groom first met. And not to be outdone, Greg s brothers and co-best men thoroughly entertained and simultaneously humiliated their middle brother by reading entries from a journal Greg kept as a child, while in the end, concluding their speeches with heartfelt words exhibiting the deep bond and connection the three brothers shared. The remainder of the evening was all about dancing and celebrating. Even with many guests having to board planes in a few hours to return to the east coast, the incredible 16-piece band from Wayne Foster Entertainment kept the dance-floor packed and by the designated end time, guests were repeatedly chanting  ONE MORE SONG,  refusing to call it a night!'
p6228
aS'From the Bride  What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas  right? Not in this case. I was in town with a friend wanting to watch March Madness at a low key spot ,while Greg, in from NYC, shared the same idea. We both landed at Emeril Lagasse s sports bar, and as the famous chef would say:  BAM!  Sparks flew and Greg ended up on one knee and offered me a ring made from a cocktail straw promising eternity   it was truly love at first sight! Just seven months after Greg had proposed with a cocktail straw ring, and coordinating dates all over the country from Austin, NYC, San Diego, Park City, Seattle, and a 2,980 mile road trip, Greg officially made the move to Southern California and this time proposed to me with the real thing.'
p6229
aS'The day was EVERYTHING we had hoped for  Love filled our hearts, romance filled the air and we had so much FUN until the early hours of the morning! We are forever grateful to Sin City!'

S'We ve seen wedding inspiration come from just about everything, but I do believe this is the very first SMP wedding inspired by a deck of UNO cards. And after taking a peek at this gallery from Studio Castillero, you ll leave you never looking at the game of UNO the same. With stunning florals from The Little Branch, beautiful touches by  Casa De Perrin and Found Vintage Rentals, and beautiful planning by Amber Events this is a theme wedding done right.'
p6271
aS'From the Bride Planning a wedding is obviously a very daunting process. As we were planning ours, we wanted to make it as easy as possible. Being a marketer by trade, I m always looking for the  big idea  that would guide the decision making process. In looking for that inspiration, we had a really easy answer   toys. Both my husband and I worked at Mattel, which is where we met.'
p6272
aS'Our main source of inspiration was UNO cards. We loved the idea of incorporating toys, but didn t want to go overboard. The 40th Anniversary Edition of UNO felt like the right place to start. They had a vintage look and feel, perfect for table numbers, colors that we could work with for all aspects of venue, and of course, reflects so many emotions dating back to childhood. We wanted the entire wedding to feel light-hearted, colorful, and fun   just as we feel we are as a couple. For colors, we chose aspects of the primary colors of the UNO cards themselves. We took the idea of vintage childhood and incorporated other elements   classic coke bottles, craft pom poms, Dr. Seuss book as our guest sign in, baby pictures, and other childhood elements.'
p6273
aS'When thinking about your childhood, you also immediately think about the home you grew up in. We wanted as many of the environmental elements to convey home. Guests sat in couches with pillows and blankets. We walked down an aisle of layered rugs. The ceremony backdrop was a mantle with the added touch of the ceremony being led by my Husband s father who wrote his own custom ceremony for us. We kept the ceremony short, with no wedding party, so everyone present could relax, enjoy the event, and have a great time.'
p6274
aS'Our vendors made the day seamless for us too. Nira from Amber Events, Rachel & Rico from Studio Castillero, the gals from Whoa Nelly and The Little Branch, brought the day to life in ways we didn t even think was possible. We were able to fully enjoy every moment with our friends and family. Oh and the  Wild Card  table certainly lived up to their table assignment!\n'

aS'And a sweet film from Lovespun Handmade Wedding Films for even more pretty '
p6361
aS'From the Bride  Jason and I met through our mutual friends, Jimmy and Lily, and we had our first date in Lisbon, Portugal   Really! Jimmy and Lily were recent newlyweds and were kind enough to invite the two us individually to join them on their honeymoon to Portugal and Spain. Leading up to the trip, we would hear tidbits about each other, but only briefly met a few times. At first glance we seemed so different from one other, that I didn t see anything past a good, fun loving friendship. But that quickly changed. Immediately landing in Portugal, I saw how caring and protective Jason was. He swept me off my feet with his kind and caring heart and we share the same love for life, travel and adventure. We had a wonderful time together on that trip and we ve since added Greece, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, New York and other domestic destinations and road trips to our list of travels together. Four years later, he proposed during a Christmas party we were hosting. Posing as neighborhood carolers, Jason s friends from his old church rang the doorbell and sang some holiday jingles. We all piled out onto the porch decorated with string lights and candles when they began singing  Marry Me  by Train which is one of my most favorite songs. After the song finished, Jason got down on one knee and the rest is history. I was completely surprised and elated! It was the perfect proposal since we were surrounded by our family and friends.'
p6362
aS'Of our travels, we completely fell in love with the romance and quaint gardens of Tuscany, Italy so we knew we wanted the ceremony to be outdoor in a garden setting. We envisioned our wedding to be personal, vintage, and romantic with a touch of glam. Casa Real Winery was the perfect choice since it had a bit of everything with their charming Sun Garden and elegant Grand Ballroom where we held the reception. We had a power team of vendors, including our floral designer, Nicole Ha, who created different looks by using vintage elements for the ceremony and adding just the right amount of sparkle to glam up the reception in the evening. She even added hops and malts in the boutonnieres and bouquets to incorporate Jason s passion for craft beer. 1000 Fine Events and Fantasy Sound Events provided warmth and elegance by dressing up the ballroom with romantic chiffon drapery, enchanting chandeliers and personalized gobo lighting. The color palette was an easy and obvious choice since I love all things lavender. I added mauve, ivory and other blush and pastels to complement the vintage look and create an overall soft and romantic feel.'
p6363
aS'I LOVE to make and craft things and I have always loved event planning   the little details are what make it so special and personal! I made the framed table numbers, designed the paper elements, and hand-crafted all of the rustic burlap decor and props like the ring pillow, bunting flags, sachet bags filled with lavender buds, and signs. For the escort cards, we enlisted the help of our amazing bridal party to pot all of the succulent cuttings and tie name tags onto the jars. The most difficult part was probably watering the jars one by one and keeping all of the succulents alive and healthy for seven weeks! To save on cost, I also created the burlap mason jars, lace vases and floral centerpieces for the head table and cocktail tables. Both Jason and I have a serious sweet tooth, so in addition to the Gelato Cart, Jason s friend Antoine baked four kinds of our favorite cookies as a late night treat for our guests. All this seemed daunting at first without a wedding planner, but I had so much fun thinking up and creating all the details which made our wedding feel intimate and personal despite the large guest list. If you are also a DIY bride, one word of advice is to commit to a design/theme and start early! In order to keep the stress level low, I started crafting a few nights each week six months prior to the wedding. It felt great to cross things off the list and with each completed project, our excitement grew.'
p6364
aS'Our wedding day was everything we hoped for and more. The weather was perfect, all of the details came together perfectly, and our friends and family had a wonderful time. The day was packed but the events flowed beautifully with the help of the Casa Real staff and our good friend Philip who emceed the reception. Jason and I even snuck out from the reception for a few minutes to enjoy some newlywed alone time and watch the magical glow of the sunset over the vineyards. (We highly recommend this!) I have a lot of favorite parts, but I d say the first look was by far the highlight of the day. We initially hadn t planned on one, but our photographer, Caroline Tran, advised us of all the benefits and tender moments of a first look. Aside from the logistical reasons and allowing more time for photos, it gave us quiet and raw intimate alone time amongst the craziness of the day to take in what the day was really about   committing ourselves to each other and sharing our love for one another with our family and friends. It was so amazing to see each other for the first time without the worry of tripping down the aisle. The moment was so sweet and the feeling indescribable. Jason even got teary eyed and he NEVER sheds a tear!'

aS'We were delighted to hear from our guests throughout the day that the wedding really reflected who we were individually and together as a couple and from our vendor friends that they learned so much about us from our personal vows. Leading up the wedding, I was a bit anxious since I had broken my foot and had the cast prematurely removed 3 days before the wedding. The heels unfortunately made a (very) short cameo, but all of the love and happiness that surrounded us erased the pain and we were able to relax and enjoy the day. We loved every moment and wished the day didn t have to end!'

S'Fall = Romance, in my book. Something about warm colors aligned with the release from unrelenting heat beckons love. Take a look at this bride whose October wedding perfectly captures the feeling with rustic DIY touches, deep blue and orange hues (and succulents for a nice Southwestern touch). Keep scrolling for stunning images from the guys at Studio 7 who were there to document the event.'

aS'Seeing him made me immediately feel calm and at peace; this is what all of the planning was for! I did not hire a wedding planner, I wanted to be involved, and instead had a friend (who does weddings at another local venue) suggest some vendors for me and also manage the actual  Day Of  details. I tried throughout the process to keep it simple and let my vendors do what they do best by standing out of their way, but try as I might, there were still many details to sort out leading up to the  big day . However, from our  first look  on, I forgot about all those details. Everything fell into place and I felt stunned by the beauty of how everything came together. Also, because we kept the bridal party to just family, we had time to hang out and enjoy ourselves, keeping stress to a minimum.'
p6413
aS'The ceremony was the most special for me. Having my mother walk me down the aisle, to Louis Armstrong s  What a Wonderful World  brought tears to our eyes. A dear friend performed the ceremony that combined the traditions and values of our two cultures thoughtfully and respectfully. We included the Jewish traditions of the Chuppah and Ketubah, as well as stomping on a glass, and of course we danced the Hora at the reception. A friend of mine read a verse from the old testament and the new, representing the Christian faith of my family. Three of my mother s friends wrote a song for us, and performed it at dinner, which was a tradition in their family that was a hilarious addition to our night.'

aS'And a sweet film from Artisan Production?  Yes, please.'
p6536
aS'From the Bride  Timmy (my husband) proposed on July 6th, 2012 underneath the Golden Gate Bridge on a bridge to bridge boat tour. It was absolutely perfect, as San Francisco means so much to both of us (I grew up in Marin, where my family still resides and Tim s friends all live in SF, too). We knew immediately after getting engaged so close to the 4th of July and in the Bay Area, that we wanted our wedding day to reflect that as much as possible. We ended up falling in love with Solage Resort (in Calistoga) for our reception venue, as it was both sophisticated and had an Americana charm to it, as well. We also secured a date close to our engagement day (exactly one year and one week to the day). Tim and I are both pretty traditional so we moved forward with a full Catholic mass at the beautiful St. Helena Catholic Church. We kept the decor within the Church very minimal, as it had a classic beauty of its own that we wanted to really shine through. We adored our Priest, Father John Brenkle, who came out of retirement to officiate just for us   so special and we sincerely appreciated it.'
p6537
aS'Despite the popularity of it these days, Tim and I decided NOT to do a first look before our mass. Call us  superstitious  or  old-fashioned,  but it s always been a favorite of mine to see the groom s face when he sees his bride for the first time in front of all of the loved ones. In my opinion, it s always one of the most touching moments. Tim s reaction upon seeing me for the first time certainly did not disappoint! My dad and I were doing pretty well up until the doors opened and we saw Tim burst into tears! He was overwhelmed with pure joy and happiness and that spilled over to everyone in the Church, including my Dad and I who at that point were laugh/crying down the aisle together. I will never forget that moment as you really could FEEL the love permeate throughout the Church.'
p6538
aS'It was important to us that our wedding have some  oomph  to it. We wanted our personalities to come through in the details and more importantly, we wanted our love to really be felt throughout the day. The best way we could do that was to just have fun with the planning and find elements that reflected who we are, what we love and our history. I happen to love a good pun! The more areas where we could incorporate fun pun play, we did. For example, for our guest s thank you gifts and table assignments, we bottled Limoncello and added a custom label to it that we playfully called  Flemincello!  The kids got to partake in this fun too, as we also made  Flemonade  for them to enjoy.'
p6539
aS'In keeping with the pun play, we also had our ceremony programs turned into actual fans, and we had it read as,  I am a Fan of Timmy and Gianna!  The church itself gets really hot in the summertime, so our guests could literally use our program fans to cool themselves off!'
p6540
aS'Originally, we wanted to also include sparklers at our reception, especially since we were getting married within the  fireworks  season. Unfortunately, Solage did not allow said sparklers, so we found other creative ways to incorporate a sense of  sparks  throughout the ceremony and reception   hints of gold in our tablescapes and wedding cake, gold lettering in our invitations, custom program fans, menu, etc., my bridesmaids  gowns and the groomsmen s bowties were a light gold champagne color, and the chandeliers even had their own little bit of sparkle. To top it all off, we had gold confetti that dropped from the ceiling later on in the night to really set a spark to the dance floor!'
p6541
aS'A personal fact that we simply couldn t (or wouldn t want) to ignore is the fact that Tim and his entire family are from Las Vegas, NV. What better way to acknowledge this fact then by creating a full blown party on the dance floor. The greatest DJ ever, DJ Josh Dukes of Boutique DJs, kept our guests dancing until midnight by delivering some of the best music ever that truly never alienated any age group. It was perfect! At 10PM, the gold confetti dropped from the ceiling and let everyone know it was time to REALLY party. Our waiters passed out  late night  snacks, gold Elvis sunglasses, and oversized glow stick rods that really made it feel like you had just stepped into a Vegas nightclub. One final surprise was left, when we presented Tim with the surprise groom s cake, a  Welcome to Las Vegas  design by none other than Sweet on Cake.'
p6542
aS'Overall, this was a day that overflowed with laughter, good tears and nonstop fun. There were incredibly touching/emotional groomsmen speeches (as you can again see from Timmy s tears in the pics again, love it), to our hyper-energetic father-daughter dance to Bob Seger s  Old Time Rock and Roll , and concluding with my sisters organizing a surprise flash mob that secretly involved all of our awesome wedding guests, Tim and I couldn t have asked for more! It was truly the most perfect day and what makes it even more perfect, is knowing that I get to spend EVERY DAY with my all-time favorite person in this whole world, my husband.'

aS'From the Bride  When people asked me what I  envisioned  for my wedding day, I really had no idea what to say! I ve always dreamed of marrying a man as wonderful as my husband Jon, but had never given the wedding itself a second thought. Although we started the planning process from square one, there was one requirement: we wanted it to be a fun party! Jon and I both come from families that love to dance, and having a festive, light hearted affair where our loved ones could have a great time was a priority. When the crowed started chanting in unison  One last song!  at the end of the night, I thought to myself: Mission Accomplished.'
p6674
aS'It was also important to us to keep as much of the wedding as locally-focused as possible. We love living in San Francisco, and wanted to bring a taste of that to our guests. My dress was designed and made in SF, as was Jon s suit. The food served was organic, locally grown and seasonal, and dessert was ice cream sandwiches called It s-Its that have been made in San Francisco since 1928! Our signature cocktail, a blackberry and lemon mojito called Black Magic, was inspired by the SF dive bar where Jon and I had our first kiss, The Black Magic Voodoo Lounge.'

aS'I fell in love with the Headlands Center for the Arts the first time I saw it online, and even more so the day we toured the space. It felt so quintessential Bay Area   beautiful scenery, a gorgeous historic building, and a little funky art thrown in too. I tried to choose soft, luxe details in dusty pinks and golds and tons of tea lights to add softness and shine to the architectural space. After spending hours discussing flowers, making decorations, and finding ways to incorporate our family heirlooms, it was such a joy to see the space on our wedding day   filled with the things and people we adore!'
p6676
aS'The biggest piece of advice that helped me when I found myself obsessing over planning minutia, was to remember why I was doing all this in the first place   to marry the person I love and celebrate with our friends and family. Although it s easy to get carried away with wedding planning mania, really everything else is just (fun!) details.'

S'For as pretty as San Luis Obispo is all on its own, it s made even more so with the addition of a beautiful rustic celebration. One that has a little So Cal Spanish flavor. Think papel picado, pinatas, and horses a plenty all set against the beauty of Greengate Ranch & Vineyard. And it doesn t stop there, the flowers by Amanda Borges, the navy and white details coordinated by Jaime Strand and the imagery captured by Snapmotive all come together for one crazy good affair   see it right here.'

aS'From the bride  The Wedding Day for both of us was a surreal experience, and probably in the most non-traditional sense. We both went into the day with a variety of insights from family and friends who told us either how nervous or overwhelmed they felt on their big day. After regrouping and talking through how we felt on our wedding day, I don t think either of us felt the normal  nerves  that are typically associated with weddings. Rather, there was an overwhelming sense of peace throughout the day, which allowed us to be more joyfully present during each moment of our wedding. Everything- from the people surrounding us to the smallest of details- was excellent. We really had a blast celebrating with our friends and family!'
p6719
aS'What inspired you  Between the two of us, there wasn t much inspiration that we pulled from in outside sources (i.e. blogs, magazines, etc). It was a really organic process- we defined what our dream look/theme would be, what constraints we had and then went to work. We both are really drawn to latin culture, and with both of us being bilingual Spanish-speakers, we thought that a Mexican-Californian theme would be more than appropriate. Our goal was to keep things simple, but consistent. We had papel-picado (the white cut-out banners) hanging from the ceiling and 8  glass candles that helped light each table. There was a bar stocked with Mexican beer and a couple decorative pi atas floating around on tables. In essence, we wanted to be able to look back on our wedding photos 25 years from now and still think what we did was timeless and cool.'
p6720
aS'Special touches  There was a point just before the ceremony where Mike was blindfolded and led to where Jo was in the Carriage House up on the hill (we didn t do a first look, so he wasn t allowed to peek before the ceremony). For a very rich 15-mintues, we were surrounded by close family and friends in prayer who prayed for our marriage. That was an unforgettably powerful moment for the both of us.'
p6721
aS'DIY projects  Annie Berg, our close friend (and incredible calligrapher!), helped create the killer Table Seating Chart and Bar Menu that we had at our wedding. She also artfully penned each guests  name on the name tag that awaited them at their table. She did an amazing job keeping her work consistent with the look of our invitations, while adding her touch to it.\n'

S'Taking a vow to love and support someone until the very end is a beautiful thing to promise. This wedding, photographed (appropriately) by Love Is A Big Deal, embraces that gravity with open arms. The Anaheim Hills provide a dramatic backdrop for a day surrounded by friends, family, and let s not forget the love. Rich red and blue hues also do a lot to warm the heart. You can find more images here.'
p6762
aS'From the Bride  Throughout the wedding planning process it was important to both of us to have our community in mind. Since they have helped shape and cultivate our relationship, we wanted the core of our wedding to be not just our story, but the bigger story of all of us journeying through life together. We couldn t wait to make a covenant to each other, and wanted to make sure our friends and families knew they have a role to play in that. Some memorable moments we had included Louie s dad marrying us, which was an extreme privilege to have the man that raised and loved Louie his whole life up there blessing our marriage. We also had Laurie (Louie s mom) do all of the incredible flower arrangements, decorations, and an endless list of behind the scenes magic-making. Michiko s mom and other friends did the baking, and had countless friends helping out on the actual wedding day.'
p6763
aS'As we look back on that day, it s hard not to feel overwhelmed with feeling truly celebrated and loved. Not a moment went by where we didn t feel the tremendous joy our community has had for us all along. We were blown away by the amount of people that came up to us genuinely happy, and shared with us how special it was to be there and that they could not be happier to celebrate us. Since we like to get crazy, we were pumped that Meg and Josh (who we could not have been happier with) were feeling the call of wild as well. They brought us some animal masks to wear during the dancing  let s just say it turned things waaay up and solidified their status in our minds as truly heroic human beings.The entire night could not have been more fun, spontaneous, and full of joy and love. And the best part about it all was sharing it together.\n'

S'Umm  I am at a complete loss for words.  Granted, that s something I have grown to expect when it comes to the work of the talented team at Docuvitae, but this breathtaking Bel Air affair?  It s insane.  Think lush, overflowing blooms from Brad Austin, a world of pretty styled to perfection by Samantha Scott Events and one of the most breathtaking locales you ll ever see (the bride s family home).  This, loves, is what awesome looks like.  See it all in the full gallery.'
p6784
aS'From Docuvitae  Crissy always dreamed of getting married at her parents  home in Bel Air. So after a romantic proposal by her now husband Mike she didn t have to look far to find the perfect venue. In fact, Crissy isn t the only bride with history attached to her family s stunning Bel Air estate. On April 29th, 1930, Irene Mayer, daughter of Hollywood legend Louis B. Mayer, married her fianc  David Selznick, and in true Hollywood fashion Mr. Mayer gave Irene her choice of any house as a wedding gift. Soon after Irene chose the same Wallace Neff Normandy estate now owned by Crissy s family. Needless to say the stage was set for one of the most unique and romantic weddings of the year.'
p6785
aS'With whimsical elegance as the theme, bride Crissy and event planner Samantha Scott went to work creating three unique spaces within the property. Over 10,000 square feet of custom wood decking was built just for the day, hundreds of one of a kind handmade balsa wood roses were interspersed between beautifully wild florals, manzanita branches and sandblasted Zinfandel vines. To complement the home s already stunning and perfectly groomed French landscape, an almost invisible tent structure was built and a plethora of hanging Edison bulbs, structural string lights, Fellini light chandeliers and twinkle light webs were installed as to create a glowing ceiling. As guests walked through a floating valence made of hops vines to enter the reception, they were transported into a perfectly imperfect wonderland of light, texture and beauty.'
p6786
aS'Just as the reception had come to a close, guests were escorted to an old-fashioned after hours soir e in the home s parlor. Tray passed late-night snacks were complimented by the sounds of a fedora-clad piano player. The songs of Elton John were sung by all as silver trays of Scotch and champagne were served early into the next morning. But guests had one more surprise waiting for them as they departed, bakers boxes of donut holes waited in guests cars for a final sweet treat to cap off a perfect night.'
