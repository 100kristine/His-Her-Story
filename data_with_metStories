Our fathers provided the  Blessing of the Hands  before we exchanged rings, which brought us both to tears.

S'Matthew proposed in the fall of our second year on the island, a proposal that was totally a surprise. Something that is hard to do when you have been with someone for a decade and already very intertwined. He somehow pulled it off and caught me completely off guard and with the sweetest proposal. In true Matthew form it included animals a story about penguins and how they pick one mate for life. I was blown away not only that the whole thing was happening but by how nervous he was, it was simply so sweet. It made me giggle because after a decade I don t know how he ever thought for one second I would hesitate that yes he was so anxious to hear. It was such special day. I now had a fiance and a new journey to look forward to together all while enjoying the beautiful scenery we called home, the Carribean. After about a month of being engaged I knew it was time to start thinking about planning. The initial planning part was a little overwhelming at first, I didn t know where to begin. Mainly because I was trying to start it all from the Caribbean which meant I had to make quick trips back to California that were always a whirlwind with so much to do and see. All of which I know wouldn t have been possible without the help of our amazing families and the best girlfriends a girl could ever ask for. I remember seeing Bacara online before I saw it in person and we both fell in love. We loved that it was in Santa Barbara, a place we think of as beautiful and romantic which is a perfect backdrop for a wedding. It was luxurious and esquisite but still had that cool California coastal feel. We knew we wanted the vibe of the day to have touchs of old hollywood glam but with modern elements so as soon as I visited Bacara in person I knew it was the perfect place. Plus we knew at Bacara guests would feel like they were getting away for the weekend rather than just attending a wedding for a few hours. Once we set our fall date I knew that was the easiest part and what was to come would be hard because now we had so many details to decide on. That overwhelming feeling all changed when fate brought me to my first phone call with Allyson Joseph of Bob Gail Special Events. Hiring Ally as our wedding planner was the easiest decision I ever made, we had an instant connection. From the beginning Ally understood our vision and that showed throughout the whole process. She remembered and applied detail that is above and beyond. A five star service I know is one of a kind. We are so thankful for Ally, Lexi, Katie and the whole team. Not only did they do a great job but they work with and recommed the best of the best so our vendors were impecable. I truly don t know what I would have done without her expertise, she just got me and was always there to talk me through every detail. Being long distance from one another that was something I really valued and appreciated. As a result of our wedding not only did we meet an event planner for life but most importantly a friend for life  she truly is like family along with the rest of the Bob Gail team. Having our family and closest friends all together to celebrate our much anticipated day and with so much to be grateful for, it was simply perfection.'

S'From the beautiful Bride  Matthew and I met 12 years ago while in high school in Carlsbad, CA. Matthew finishing his junior year and myself a senior about to graduate and head to LA for college at Loyola Marymount University. Even though we meet at the end of high school we always call ourselves high school sweethearts because we can t remember what it was even like without one another. Both of us were born and raised in Carlsbad and attended the same junior high and high school. I was the first to admired Matthew from a distance before I finally asked a mutual friend about him; if he was single and a good guy. I think it was about a week later we had our first date and shortly thereafter we were two teenagers who were falling madly in love. One year later Matthew followed me to college at LMU. In the years that followed, throughout undergraduate school, we had some ups and downs but our life journey always brought us back to one another. Once we both graduated college we truly knew what we had and our relationship grew to an unbreakable bond. Living together in Westchester I quickly started working in Finance and Matthew was working as a Vet tech applying to Veterinary schools. After a few years he was accepted into Ross University a school in the West Indies. After many in depth conversations we decided to take the opportunity and make the big move. At first it was really hard to leave our life in Southern California; the familiarity we had built, my career and of course our family and friends but shortly after the move we realized everything was happening for a reason. We were on this once in a lifetime adventure together, meeting great friends and experiencing a different way of life. Being away and only having one another to lean on for everything our relationship grew to strongest it had ever been. We had a life together on an island in the Caribbean and it was amazing. We lived there with our two children (our dogs) and during our time there adopted two more. It was our first big adventure together and we loved what it did not only for us as individuals but together as a couple. After living in the Caribbean for a little over 2 years we finished his last year of school, his clinical year, at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. The South was a great experience but we were happy to head back to Los Angeles when the time came. As of recently we are back in beautiful Southern California. With a new and exciting outlook on life we hope to start putting down some roots soon and enjoy lifes special moments together as a family. We will forver be open to new adventures so who knows what the future may hold. Throughout all our years together and especially the last few away we have undoubtedly become stronger, wiser, more compassionate and even closer bestfriends. And above all, we truly love each other more everyday.'

aS'Our big day was beyond what I could have ever imagined. It was really important to us to provide our guests with an environment that made for an effortless evening, a sense of being taken care of. We wanted them to enjoy and party all night long without any care. Something Ally made sure went off without a hitch thorughout the whole day. When it finally came time to walk down the aisle as soon as I locked eyes with Matthew I knew all the extra stuff was just an added bonus. He truly is my heart and soul. After the ceremony we had a short but very special few minutes alone just us and the sunset where we had a chance to take everything in and just enjoy the moment together. Once we made our way up to the reception area I remember walking in for a sneak peek and even though I knew how everything was going to be set up there was nothing that could prepare me for how special it all felt when I stood in front of all our visions and dreams in real time, it was overwhelming in the best kind of way. From absolutely beautiful weather and scenery all weekend long, to the presence of our closest family and friends, to the exquisite detail, to the gorgous flowers, to the abubndance of food & drinks, and to the most amazing band, we couldn t have asked for a more perfect day. We are so grateful we have beautiful photos from Michael and Anna Costa to look at for years to come and of course a video we can t to watch from Vidicam Productions. Looking back on the day Matthew and I feel so lucky to have shared it all together. It was truly everything we dreamed of and so much more. A special thank you to everyone who was there to celebrate the start of our happily ever after with us.\n'

S'From Heather Cook Elliott Photography Lindsey & Tim s wedding day was beautifully styled and made for general photographic awesomeness, but despite the fact that this gallery is full of photographs of all their lovely details, I must write that their wedding day was really and truly about love   the love they share for one another, the love they ve been blessed to grow up with and the love they ll have for their future family. Tim & Lindsey met in medical school at Mayo and are starting careers at a prestigious institution out east so yes, they have really good resumes, but at their wedding Tim & Lindsey s big, happy hearts were what anyone noticed and everyone cared about most. All day they exuded a joyfulness that touched everyone around them, that threatened constantly to well up and over into tears, that made everyone present grateful to be a part of such a day. But Lindsey & Tim didn t just absorb well-wishes   they continuously gave them back (as I suspect is the norm in their everyday lives) and delighted guests with, delicious foods, sights to be seen, games to be played, dances to be danced and even a meteor shower to be enjoyed. And they said Thank You in a most memorable way. After the toasts and dinners had been enjoyed Lindsey and Tim stood proudly in front of all their guests and told everyone about how lucky and blessed they are to have amazing families, parents and friends. Their parents, they said in particular, had formed them, modeling healthy marriages and lives well lived such that Lindsey and Tim have no doubt that they too will have a happy marriage. And as her dad teared up, Lindsey confirmed what everyone instinctively feels about the two of them   they are ready and excited to make each other the ultimate priority and build lives worth celebrating together. She simply said  mom, dad: we got this. '

S'From there, we started diving into the details of our  theme  of the wedding with our wedding planner Lynsay from Lux Events. Can I first say how amazing she is? Hands down, one of the most creative, inspiring, professional, and thoughtful people I have ever met. She really took the time to get to know us as a couple, and just took the extra time to ensure all the details were perfect. Considering we are so passionate about our careers, Lynsay gave us the idea to give our wedding a bit of a medical twist. Luckily, my maid of honor is a graphic designer and was able to whip up some amazing sign-in cards with each of them saying please write a  Prescription for a Happy Marriage  for the bride and groom. Also, for party favors we bought mini-brown glass bottles (to resemble a pill bottle), stuffed them with jelly beans, and had stickers made that said  There is no remedy to love but to love more.  All the guest loved them and were able to bring them home for treats the next day!'

S'From the Bride  Derek and I met when we were 18-years-old on the first day of college and instantly bonded over similar senses of humor, a love of electronic music, and an affinity for late-night diner food. We started out as neighbors, but quickly became inseparable. To the surprise of no one, we ve been close friends ever since (Who says you can t marry your first love?!). We dated on and off through college and finally, after being on for five years and having lived in four different cities, decided to officially keep building a life together.'
p373
aS'Since our wedding was in Hawaii, we took full advantage of the fact people were vacationing and ready to have fun before, during, and after the event. Derek and I met our guests as they arrived on the Oahu which allowed us to catch up and go road tripping, snorkeling, beach walking, surfing, bar hopping and sunbathing before the ceremony. My parents also hosted a  Welcome to Hawaii  cocktail hour which allowed our guests to get acquainted if they weren t already, or catch up before the big day. Perhaps the most memorable activity in which several of our friends partook was skydiving over the North Shore the day after the ceremony.'
p374
aS'Visually, we decided on a beach-inspired, but romantic color palette in mint green, sandy gray and peach with lots of geometric and contrasting organic texture. The full, luscious flowers in the bouquets as well as on the tables were chosen to compliment the other design elements and match the shape and texture of my wedding gown. We also chose table settings which would accentuate the whimsy and romance of the day by using chevron runners and several different vessels for lush florals. I also adore the romantic but fierce Ghost Chairs we used that, like our wedding, are a mixture of both new and old style.'
p375
aS'Derek and I both love food, so we wanted to get away from the whole idea that wedding food needs to be inaccessible or mass-produced and went with local chefs cooking simply and naturally with great local ingredients, infusing our event with additional Hawaiian flavor. From the pupus to the several course dinner, we wanted to provide people with approachable but upscale choices, sometimes offering bar food options like pork sliders, evoking the sense that you re at a family gathering or cookout. Derek and I brought specialty bottles of cachaca to Hawaii for our signature beverage, a mint-colored caipirinha, that was presented in mason jars with decorative straws.'
p376
aS'From Michelle Garibay Events  Working with Kari and Derek on their destination wedding was such a joy! They are true dream clients. They were both equally involved in the planning process but each had their specific priorities and in the end, everything came together beautifully! Kari and I hit it off from the first phone call and designing a wedding where the bride had such an eye for design and detail, made my job fun and easy. We were both so excited when we met for the first time after our 11 month partnership just one day before the wedding!'

S'The best advice I could give any bride is to choose experienced vendors they can wholeheartedly trust to execute their big day. We were told that our wedding day would fly by quickly but had no idea what that truly meant until it was actually happening! Luckily, we had an amazing team to support us and ensure every detail was attended to so that we could focus on spending time with our family and friends. Our coordinator, Joy, of Joy Proctor Design, was a dream to work with and quite possibly the sweetest person we ve ever met! From day one, she gave us amazing advice on the planning process and was an invaluable partner. On top of that, she has an amazing eye for design; we knew we could trust her to bring our wedding vision to life! Our photographer, KT Merry, and her assistant, Chad, made the perfect team and captured the precious moments of our big day beautifully. KT and Chad were by our side the entire day and made us feel extremely comfortable in front of the camera. They were super sweet, patient and consummate professionals who executed with expert precision. We also absolutely adored our videographers, Aria Studios. They were so nice and fun to hang out with, like being with old friends. They re based in Hawaii and braved not one, but two(!) hurricane warnings just to make it to our wedding! Watching their incredible Same Day Edit video at our reception was the perfect way to end the best day of our lives.'

S'D cor was a huge part of the experience we wanted to create. Most of our friends and family are scattered all over, so our time together with them has been limited and their knowledge of our relationship has been based on the cliff notes versions we ve given them over phone calls and Skype. We wanted to create a sort of museum experience in the space- a walk through the history of Chase and Tami, if you will. We incorporated artifacts from our relationship into the displays and we took advantage of each element to tell a story about us. Instead of a standard dinner, we designed a unique brunch since that s our favorite meal. Instead of a full bar, we had a bubble bar and then added the Handsome Roasters coffee cart, because coffee (and Handsome, in particular) has been a huge part of our relationship. The table themes were inspired by our adventures together. Our refrigerator at home is covered in photo strips from every booth we ve ever encountered, so we rented a photo booth. We created encyclopedia entries (a reference to my Match.com profile, where Chase first  met  me), which served as mini story captions to explain the significance of each piece. We really wanted the whole day to be interactive and for our guests to participate in the celebration instead of just sitting down and watching everything happen from their various assigned seats.'

I think that was most reflected in our cake cutting   neither of us cared or even thought about how we were going to do it or if it would ruin my makeup or our clothes. We just had fun with it and that s what I love about being with Joe, he makes everything fun. The most important thing to us on our wedding day was that it reflected who we are and what is important to us.'
p681
aS'Our favorite thing about our wedding was the ceremony. In Italy, many events, including marriages happen outside in the town square with people gathered around. There s something so beautiful and intimate about the simplicity of those gatherings. Even though it was a chilly November night and the only light we had was from a few string lights, we decided to get married on an alleyway stoop with our family and friends gathered around. It was perfect. Joe s older brother married us, and Joe and I exchanged our own vows which added to the intimacy and comfort of our wedding ceremony.'

S'We met two summers ago, July 2011, on a mission trip to Moldova, a third-world country in Eastern Europe, which is next-door to Romania (my parents emigrated from Romania to escape communism in 1983, while Adrian was born and raised there until he 17 years old). We were both there on that trip, a world away, back in 2011 doing what we are both passionate about: serving others, especially those who have lost their mommas (as we both have).'
p713
aS'I had decided to go to Moldova that summer of 2011 to work with the young orphaned girls, and mostly to share the Pearl Story with them. The illustration of how a beautiful pearl is formed inside the shell of certain types of oysters as a defense mechanism against pain/irritation was something near and dear to my heart ever since the summer before that, 2010, after losing my mom to pancreatic cancer.'
p714
aS'As fate would have it, Adrian, whom I met for the first time on the trip, had decided to return to Moldova for his second summer in a row in 2011 (to work with the young men and orphans, who always had a special place in his heart since he himself had tragically lost his mom when he was 5 years old).'
p715
aS'While on this trip, I observed at a distance the way Adrian selflessly loved those around him, and apparently he was observing me too (I was pretending not to notice. ha) :) After exchanging only a handful of conversations together throughout the trip, we each went back to our little corners of the world after the trip had come to an end: me to my beautiful hometown of Portland, Oregon and Adrian to Huntington Beach, California.'
p716
aS'I thank God for Adrian everyday. He is the most wonderful person I have ever met, and inspires me to be a better person everyday! He truly is my hero!'

It s location was just perfect, in the heart of downtown on a quite street that provided peace and privacy. The building from the outside looked like an architectural treasure with tall columns, beautiful stairway, and mystic giant green doors which captivated our attention. Once we stepped inside, our breaths were taken away. The attention to detail was impeccable: beautiful dome ceiling, stained glass, gold accents, and rich dark oak was simply stunning.

The first time we met in August of 2012 Aiasha had an entirely different vision of blues and more of a natural look in her mind as well. By January of 2013 she had changed her mind to wanting a different feel of soft oyster, warm soft gold, and creamy whites mixed with elements that were more natural such as herbs, berries, wood and bistro lighting. All of this needed to make sense at The Museum of Contemporary Art which is, of course, contemporary. '

S'Chad was quite the traveler and I was not too surprised when he suggested taking a cruise  in a couple of weeks . We left for our cruise on Friday February 15th. Looking back now, I realize he had dropped a HUGE hint on Valentine s Day by giving me two wife cards. I just thought he was being super cute like always! Day 2 of our cruise, we arrived at the Isle of Rotan, Honduras. We went snorkeling around a 7 acre private island. After snorkeling, Chad insisted we take a walk around the island and we stopped at a place with this amazing view! Chad put his arms around me and told me how much he loved me. When I turned around to give him a hug, he went down on one knee and with the ring in his hand, he asked me to marry him. I pulled him off of his knee, wrapped my arms around him, and with many happy tears said YES!'

We were immediately drawn to the Adamson House with its historical Spanish charm and panoramic ocean views. We wanted our guests to experience the incredibly beautiful ocean view at sunset as the backdrop for our vows. The reception site was our own secret garden where we celebrated under a gigantic sycamore tree. Although this if often the site of wedding ceremonies, it was the perfect place for our guests to enjoy the family-style southern cuisine and dance under the stars.'

S'From the beautiful Bride  Josh and I met on eHarmony, myself, I had only been on there for two weeks, so luckily I didn t have to go through a slew of bad dates before finding Josh. Just 6 months in we went on our first vacation in Kauai, and by then I already knew he was the one. 3 years from our very first date we found ourselves back in Kauai again for our annual summer vacation, but this time it was different. Josh had purchased a new camera that he had been filming me do almost everything on, including eating and walking, so when he decided to leave the camera rolling overnight to  catch the sunrise  I didn t question his motives. The next morning on our 3 year anniversary he woke me at 6:30 by opening the wall of curtains revealing the brightest ocean view. I immediately rolled over trying to go back to sleep. He finally was able to coax me to come to the edge of the bed, just barely awake he begins to serenade me with his ukulele (not unusual by the way). I start noticing though this time his voice is shaking, he actually seemed nervous which is not the norm. After finishing up 1,2,3,4 by Plain White Tees and a couple restarts of the song, he gets down on one knee and asks the question I had been waiting to hear almost 2 1/2 years ago! To make it even more perfect he surprised me with a serenade at our wedding! Which I was completely blown away by! He sings in front of me all the time, but never in front of an audience   an audience turns him a bit shy and bashful. But not on the day of our wedding! He was so confident and charming. He chose the song Stuck on You by Lionel Richie, which was a perfect song given I did feel like I had waited so long to become his Mrs.. It was perfect, right out of a movie.'

Manele Bay is on the beach. Shelby and Justin were excited for their wedding and had a perfect day. They got ready in their rooms then met in the garden for a first look. Then we headed down to the beach on a very calm late afternoon for their sunset ceremony. The whole time during the ceremony, there was a pod of dolphins playing and jumping just off shore. Im not sure the couple noticed they were so busy looking into each other s eyes but it was very special and not something that happens every day. After the ceremony, the couple headed up to an oceanfront cabana for a candlelit dinner and champagne.\n'

A year and a half after we met, he surprised me by proposing in the rain while on my favorite hike in Marin County. Three months later, we moved to Philadelphia for Jim s job and our planning became long distance as we both wanted to wed in California (thank goodness for our planner!). Though we initially thought the wedding would take place in San Francisco, it took only one seventy-five degree April day in Santa Barbara (where Jim s parents live) to realize that it would provide the perfect indoor/outdoor venue for us. More than anything, we wanted our wedding to be a great party with family and friends. To us, this meant having a casual, yet elegant atmosphere with good food, drinks, and dancing. '

aS'Stephanie Robinson was our florist for the event. I was referred by a friend to use Stephanie and could not have picked a better person to create the exact vision I had hoped to achieve. Stephanie works freelance so my experience was different than going into a flower shop and looking through a binder to pick the exact arrangements for the big day. Instead, Stephanie and I met over coffee and I explained to her how much I loved flowers, my way too many ideas from Pinterest, and a budget to stay within. As we talked, she helped me finally pinpoint my style and color scheme (any bride will contest how much harder of a decision this is than it truly seems) and gave me so many ideas of her own. It was cool because I felt an instant connection with Steph. I realized instantly that she was so similar to me; we shared the same style, personality and passion for flowers. I told her leaving Starbucks that day that I trusted her 100% and that she could run with my color scheme and surprise me. It was a weight off of my shoulders to allow her to be creative and it felt great to cross something off the never-ending wedding to do list. The moment she knocked on my room at The Drake Hotel was one of my favorite wedding day memories. I didn t know what my flowers were going to look like until the day they were in my arms and I had been waiting months to see what she had picked out for me. I had tears of happiness in my eyes when I saw the vibrant colors and unique styles. Not only did she create perfect bouquets but she also transformed my venue into a floral masterpiece. I could not have even envisioned more perfect flowers than what Stephanie picked and designed for our big day.'

It was such a relief when my husband and I met Jake at a coffee shop because I knew within the first five minutes that he would be our perfect wedding photographer. Nick and I had a blast with Jake as he shot our engagement pictures. We felt so comfortable with him and were laughing the entire time. We were amazed at his artistic eye and how well he was able to truly capture our love. On our wedding day, Jake was there early to shoot pictures of the landscape of our hotel and the amazing architecture of Chicago. Our entire bridal party raved about how much fun and how professional Jake was on the trolley with us, as he was able to capture our trip from the city to Evanston. Our families and our wedding guests had nothing but amazing things to say about him as well. When we received our wedding slideshow, I couldn t help but cry with happiness. I felt like I was reliving the day all over again. I was so overjoyed at how well Jake was able to capture every emotion on our wedding day. Two Birds Photography was everything we could have asked for and way, way more.'

S'The weekend was magical from start to finish. On Friday night all of the guests set sail for a whale watching cruise and saw enormous humpback whales jumping insanely close to the boat. The wedding day was just as relaxed as Kim and Bryan are together. They started off playing a game of volleyball (which is how they first met) and swimming together with their friends. About an hour before ceremony time, they made their way to different rooms to get ready. After an intimate first look in the tiny cove where the ceremony would take place, their guests made their way down and circled around the two while they said their vows. The night ended with an intimate dinner on the beach.'

S'From The Bride  Like our elopement, our love has been about living in the moment. My now husband, Paul, has been there for me through thick and thin, in sickness and in health, literally. Paul and I actually met in high school, and even went to prom together. But that was not when we fell in love. It was years later when we crossed paths on a beach that we found each other again. Despite a whirlwind of traveling apart   me in Australia, Fiji, Thailand and Europe over 3 years   him living abroad in Prague and then finishing up school in Canada   we never gave up on each other. We finally settled down in Denver,'
p1552
aS'My flowers were from a local Zihuatanejo florist that we found on the corner of a side street. The senorita there was delighted and giddy to make my wedding bouquet and his boutonniere. Our only guidelines were to keep it all white and whimsical. My jewellery on the wedding day is all from little boutiques across Denver. They are classic yet whimsical, and I feel complement the vibrancy of our day s design. I did my hair and makeup myself. I have had my hair and makeup done at weddings by others in the past   I have learned what looks good and where and when to stop or add. Because it was so hot out I had to have my hair up. We added some of the baby s breath to my hair as a last-minute addition, something that added a bit more whimsy to my look.'
p1553
aS'Getting ready was also something that was unlike other weddings I have been to. I was able to take my time, reminisce with my mom, and reflect on the celebration. Not to mention, in the beauty of our suite, I felt like the most beautiful person on earth   something that I had not felt since my surgery.'

Despite the southern charm of Savannah, we wanted to get married in Chicago because our families and many close friends reside there. Everything fell into place after we found our venue, the Armour House in Lake Forest, Illinois.

aS'As a tribute to Whitney s farming hometown and Greg s new business venture, sprigs of lavender were used to elegantly accent the flutes of champagne welcoming guests to the cocktail reception, overlooking La Costa s expansive golf course. Inside the ballroom, dining tables displayed a mixture of tall centerpieces in gorgeous cut-crystal vases and elegant candelabras and low silver mercury footed pedestals. Artfully composed by The Vines Leaf, arrangements were filled with all of the bride s favorites, including dreamy Juliet garden roses, full-sized blush Caf  au Lait dahlias and draping ivory tulips. And LOTS and LOTS of warm candlelight romantically illuminating the ballroom. Large French doors to the side of the room led to a sprawling terrace and a lounge setup of tufted and mirrored furniture, also highlighted by candlelight and soft lighting. Just as impressive as the room d cor was the amazing wedding cake from Filigree Cakes, which our groom and his sweet tooth were MOST anxious to enjoy! Tiers of vanilla cake, Bavarian cream and fresh berries and decadent chocolate cake filled with layers of chocolate hazelnut were complemented with fresh flowers, pearl accents and the couple s monogram. And symbolically tying all the details together were the toasting glasses from Whitney s parents  wedding, displayed by the bride and groom.'

aS'The evening began with our father of the bride giving an emotionally touching speech, reflecting on special father-daughter moments he and Whitney shared together and also warmly welcoming Greg into the family. Following suit, our maid-of-honor cleverly recounted many of the youthful adventures she and Whitney shared, including the fateful trip to Las Vegas where the bride and groom first met. And not to be outdone, Greg s brothers and co-best men thoroughly entertained and simultaneously humiliated their middle brother by reading entries from a journal Greg kept as a child, while in the end, concluding their speeches with heartfelt words exhibiting the deep bond and connection the three brothers shared. The remainder of the evening was all about dancing and celebrating. Even with many guests having to board planes in a few hours to return to the east coast, the incredible 16-piece band from Wayne Foster Entertainment kept the dance-floor packed and by the designated end time, guests were repeatedly chanting  ONE MORE SONG,  refusing to call it a night!'

aS'From the Groom  We met in high school through swimming and dated for two to three months. After high school we kept in touch, but started to talk more frequently starting in 2010. After a date in 2011, our relationship started to slowly grow and talks became more personal with questions of life plans and feelings towards each other often being the popular topic of each call. Knowing that I (Eric) couldn t let her slip from my grasp another time, I started to make plans to propose. A ring was purchased and airline transportation was planned. After lunch with her parents, where I again asked for permission to marry their daughter (this time in person), I surprised her at work and told her we had dinner reservations wherever she wanted to go. 24 reservations had been made and I m sure that the other 23 still aren t too happy with me. After we got back to her apartment, but before dinner, I told her that I couldn t imagine my life without her and asked her to marry me. Although she didn t say yes, the emotions that were on display were a clear indication that she felt the same.'

S'From Estera Events Matt and Michelle have been together since they met in college at Purdue. When deciding where to host their wedding that included many out of town guests, Matt and Michelle picked The Palmer House for it s rich history and Chicago feel   not to mention Michelle s love for black and gold. Her style is sophisticated and chic, but the two of them are some of the most down to earth people we ve ever had the pleasure of working with. This is the first wedding we ve done in a long time where the bride and groom waited to see each other until their ceremony, so there was such an excitement and added rush to the ceremony knowing Matt and Michelle were going to be seeing each other for the first time. Their emotions were real and everyone in the church could feel it. The entire day was filled with emotion and Jessica from JED Photography captured that in the best way. After the romantic ceremony at Notre Dame de Chicago, guests were welcomed to the Palmer House for cocktails in the mezzanine looking over the hotel. Dinner was served in the historic Empire Room followed by dancing late into the night. In keeping with the Chicago theme, late night hotdogs were served no ketchup, of course. Congratulations again, Matt & Michelle, we wish you the absolute best and thank you, again, for letting us be part of your wedding day!   Bianca, Estera Events'

We loved spending time at the resort and it sort of turned into our favorite quiet spot to get away and spend quality time with each other. On February 2nd, 2013 (the same day we met 2 years earlier) during an impromptu trip to Terranea he proposed in our favorite ocean side villa in front of the fire pit. He played our favorite song ( Cinema  by Jason Evigan) and said some of the nicest words I have ever heard   even though I cried through the entire thing! After we toasted with champagne and a beautiful bouquet of flowers was delivered to our room. Quintan knew how important my family was to me and knew that when he proposed the first thing I would want to do is tell my mom all of the details. He had asked my father for permission to marry me the day before and arranged for them to come meet us for dinner after the proposal. Later that night we went to The Strand House in Manhattan Beach and had dinner with my parents and toasted and celebrated the rest of the night.'

aS'The reception was special because it just looked breathtaking. There was an overwhelming amount of white flowers (hydrangeas and orchids   my favorite), which set the mood. The band (Rembrant) was the biggest hit of the night and kept the party going and our guests dancing. The first dance was special to us because we danced to  Cinema  the same song Quintan played when he proposed. The best part was just having all of our closets friends and family in the same place at the same time. I wanted a simple, sleek all white wedding cake accented by a few white flowers.

Since businesses were shut down and our offices were closed my girlfriends and I went to a well-known Dallas restaurant (Mi Cocina) for lunch and a few Mambo Taxi s (Margarita s). Quintan also happened to be there with a group of his friends and in the empty restaurant the waiter decided to sit our two tables right next to each other. After a few margaritas Quintan and his friends decided to break the ice with a few jokes and by the end of the night our tables were pushed together and everyone was getting to know each other. Quintan introduced himself to me early on and we had an immediate connection and spent the rest of the day getting to know each other and drinking a few too many margaritas. The best part is that most of our friends who were there that first day were bridesmaids and groomsmen in our wedding.'

S'Rachel + Adrian s Chicago wedding ended up encompassing everything that they wanted it to: it was filled with love, lots of laughter, and had an elegant Parisian vibe. And to top it all off, it all unfolded against a beautiful urban landscape. I had dreamed about photographing their wedding since the first day I met Rachel and was beaming with excitement all day long. To keep with the urban aspect of the theme I suggested the West Loop as the backdrop for the first look and formal portraits. The guys even made a stop at Au Cheval on Randolph to sip on a gorgeous 12 year old scotch before hamming it up for the camera. The ladies stepped out onto the West Loop streets in their coordinating muted pastel cocktail dresses and Rachel was an absolute dream in her Bettina gown by J.Crew. Her bouquet featured succulents and her grandmother s broach.\n\nRachel + Adrian s first look was one of the more touching I have ever documented and the red doors in the background added an awesome pop of color! The reception and ceremony was held at Fulton s on the River and I cannot say enough about the wonderful staff, especially the event planner Darcey; they made us all feel so welcomed!!\n\nDuring the ceremony a memorial chair sat vacant in the front row, lit by a single candle, commemorating the memory of Rachel s mother. Rachel and Adrian also performed a water ceremony to combine together the two great lakes they had each grew up next to. The ceremony and reception decor was nothing short of perfection and Rachel s Etsy finds, including the vintage key escort cards, accentuated the Parisian theme. The tables were adored with french macaroons, devine florals by Flowerlife, candles and feather plumes; it all paired nicely with the sleek interior at Fulton s on the River.\n\nAs the skyline turned from day to night the urban lights flooding the river and surrounding streets mirrored the flicking candles inside; guests danced to the awesome beats expertly composed by Matt Kuhnen of Style Matters while others smoked cigars and sipped bourbon on the patio along the river. From the LaSalle bridge sounds of laughter could be heard as this beautiful couple began their next stage in life  together.'

There was definitely some chemistry that night that was unmistakable. But, we were both seeing other people at that time so that dating was delayed for a few months.

S'From The Bride When I think of our love story, the words that come to my mind are courage, joy, faith, trust, sorrow, and faithfulness. Courage defines the beginning of our relationship and the courage Daniel and I had to take a risk on one another just 15 months ago. Joy defines the entire relationship of discovering our mutual passions, interests, and love of being together. Faith and trust came on the day when Daniel told me he would be leaving for a 7 month deployment to Afghanistan just five short months after we met. Faith and trust in the Lord and each other have sustained us through trials, separation, distance, and fear. Sorrow has come with separation and longing to be together. And faithfulness, the faithfulness of God has reigned true in our love story as we look back on our lives before we met, our meeting, dating, falling in love and marrying. We have seen God s faithfulness to prepare us for each other and make us better together.'

S'From The Bride  From the beginning we kept using the words: relaxed, fun, personal and something a little bit different to describe what type of wedding we wanted. I know that as far as weddings go this is probably a bit of a clich  but as we had decided to invite 40 of our closest family and friends to join us in South Africa from our London base, I thought we, at least, had a good starting point.'
p2193
aS'Originally from South Africa, I moved over to the UK to go to university and met my husband, Nick during the first few weeks. We instantly became known as  Nick and Nic  and after 10 years together, we were a few weeks away for our wedding day. Despite London being my permanent home, I had always known that when I got married I wanted to do it back in South Africa and luckily Nick loves the place as much as I do and shared my sentiments.'
p2194
aS'I love flowers but hadn t thought that we would be able to afford loads however one of the perks of getting married abroad is that it was a lot more budget conscious and as both our ceremony and reception were held in the same location we were able to move and easily re-use the flowers throughout the day. Our florist was incredible and took my inspiration pictures and put her own creative twist on it and created something breath-taking. A combination of roses, lisianthus, dahlias and hydrangeas combined with Proteas (South Africa s national flower), fynbos, Queens lace and ferns emphasised the English country garden feel. '
p2195
aS'When it came to my dress I d never known exactly what type I wanted   in fact I could tell you all the things I didn t want but not what I liked. Being only 5 2  I knew that I couldn t pull off a frothy gown and with the South African summer I wanted something light and travel friendly. I tried on several different style dresses but kept coming back to this beautiful tulle Jenny Packham dress with fluted sleeves and lots of tiny sequins and paillettes with the smallest of trains. I didn t have any sort of emotional connection to the dress but just kept being drawn back to it   it was so comfortable and flattering and could see myself spending the whole day in it. I borrowed a pair of diamond earrings from my mom and wore a simple pendant necklace that Nick gave me the day before.'

S'From the Bride It was a very rainy week in the DR up until our wedding day. We had 56 people attend the wedding from Chicago, Sweden, Germany, New York, Michigan, and Houston. The morning of consisted with a morning swim, followed by breakfast in bed that was provided by the resort. Denis & I found it surreal that our wedding day finally arrived. After breakfast he went to his room to meet his grooms men to get ready for the day. My girls and I met in my honeymoon suite and got ready. It was a sunny and super hot day   the only day without any rain. We got ready, took pictures and by the time you knew it, it was time for the ceremony. Jenny & the Dreams La Romana team did a great job getting everything ready. We had a pier ceremony & a beach reception with LED lit dance floor   highly recommend this to any bride having a breach reception! At the end of reception, we had brought sky lanterns with us for each guest to make a wish and let into the sky. This is was coolest idea as everyone loved it and it was really pretty as the sky lanterns filled up the sky with pretty lights.'

S'During their time in Salt Lake City, Megan and Carl took every opportunity to travel. In 2011 they traveled to Gold Coast, Australia for the wedding of a dear friend. After the wedding, Megan took Carl around her old stomping ground in Sydney, where she studied in 2003. On the final day of the trip, Megan and Carl visited Taronga Zoo, which Megan bragged to Carl had the best views of Sydney Harbor. While at the zoo, the two came upon a deserted amphitheater used for bird shows that just happened to have a spectacular view of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Then Megan realized Carl was kneeling down next to her. Carl proposed and pulled off nearly the impossible: he managed to surprise Megan. She had been so busy preparing to be in her friend s wedding and planning for the trip that an engagement of her own was the last thing on her mind. The next day, they flew home elated and to a very excited family who, of course, had been in on the whole scheme.'

S'From Little White Dress Bridal Shop Carl and Megan met while serving as Peace Corps education volunteers. Their paths crossed at a Peace Corps conference just outside of Namibia s capitol city, Windhoek. However, the schools they taught at were 200km from each other. This meant for the first 8 months of their relationship, seeing each other meant hitchhiking on the desolate Namibian roads from one town to the next. In 2008 Megan s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and although she was only fifteen months into her Peace Corps service, Megan decided that returning to Salt Lake City was the right thing to do. Carl finished his twenty-four months of service and opted to join Megan in Salt Lake instead of returning to his hometown of Great Falls, Montana. Carl and Megan both started graduate school as they supported Megan s mom through cancer treatment. Fortunately, the cancer treatment was successful.'
p2272
aS'Megan and Carl had decided that they would return to country they first met, Namibia, to get married. They knew that marrying in Namibia would pose interesting logistical challenges, but the two agreed it had to be done. Not only were Megan and Carl dying to return to the county they loved, where they fell in love, but Megan s family had planned to visit during her Peace Corps service, but couldn t due to her mother s illness. In the summer of 2011, Megan contacted the Sossusvlei Lodge in the southwestern part of Namibia, located on the border of the Namib-Naukluft National Park, in the Namib Desert. The Namib-Naukluft National Park boasts some of the world s largest sand dunes that are colored an intense burnt-orange, contrasting markedly to the deep blue African sky. The largest dunes are located around an area of the park called Sossusvlei, which is where the Sossusvlei Lodge takes its name. Such a tourist destination would perhaps help entice friends and relatives to join in on the journey. Christelle du Toit, hotel manager and event coordinator of the Sossusvlei Lodge, responded to Megan s initial requests, and they exchanged a few emails coordinating logistics, and in one email, Christelle wrote:  It will be our pleasure to make your request come true.  It felt like a fairy godmother granting a wish, but the requestors had not given much detail. Megan and Carl wanted the wedding to be simple, personal and elegant, but neither had given much thought to wedding details. They two just wanted to travel! Christelle mentioned the menu was pre-set due to the logistics of being literally in the middle of nowhere, flowers would be difficult due to the location and heat, there was no electricity at the ceremony site, they could not accommodate more than seventy people because they only had seventy chairs and they had never put together a rehearsal dinner before.  Fine, fine, fine,  Megan and Carl said. The location and being together were all that mattered. In August of 2011, the bride and groom s parents hosted an engagement party and announced that in two years time, on August 26th, 2013, Megan and Carl would wed at the Sossusvlei Lodge in Namibia and anyone interested in an African adventure should consider joining.'
p2273
aS'Carl and his groomsmen, including his best man and the officiant, Ghidewon Arefe, made due by ironing shirts on footstools. Megan s flower girls came to get ready with the bridal party. Christelle told everyone except the bridal party to be ready to leave at 4:15 PM sharp to be shuttled via sand buggy to the wedding site (wherever that was). The bridal party was shuttled out at 4:30 in a sand buggy Christelle and her team tied with a simple ribbon and wreathe. Christelle also personally made a bouquet for Megan of grasses from around the lodge so she would have something to hold as she walked down the aisle. The driver set off straight into the desert, and nothing but grass, sand, mountains and a few sparse trees were in view. Finally the group arrived at a nook at the base of a rocky outcrop with a giant camelthorn tree set between two huge boulders. Christelle hung wooden hearts on the tree that swirled in the desert breeze and lined the aisle with native grasses. Carl and Megan chose a rendition of  Fools Rush In  performed by Megan s aunts for the processional. A lot of time and effort went into the ceremony program, which Megan and Carl were so excited to share with their guests. The first reading was Goodridge vs. the Department of Public Health, the 2003 ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Court that legalized gay marriage, which is an issue close to the hearts of the couple. The bride and groom s parent s helped honor relatives that couldn t be there, those that had passed and also offered advice for the couple entering into their marriage. Next, Megan s brother, Zach, debuted a song he wrote called  Your Someone  on his Key-tar, which he d lugged from Salt Lake along with a battery powered amplifier, since there was no electricity at the site. The  Dude of Honor  read a passage from one of the couple s favorite books, Travels with Charlie. Carl s dad performed the Hungarian tradition of placing a gold and silver coin in the shoe of the bride to symbolize never having to go without, which honored Carl s Hungarian grandmother and the couple concluded the ceremony with the breaking of a wineglass to honor Megan s Jewish heritage.'

Heavily featured with beautiful blooms and a lovely pastel palette, I dreamt up a stylized shoot that had a Boho vibe with a rustic touch. I wanted it to be soft, romantic, and simple, yet incorporate certain must-have s such as a floral headpiece, a rustic outdoor setting, several DIY touches, a beautiful flowing gown these things, to me, are the essence of Bohemian weddings. From there, I knew that I wanted to collaborate with the talented local vendors of Madison, Wisconsin, some of the best in the wedding industry. I met with each vendor, one on one, to discuss bringing my vision to life. Every single detail was carefully thought out, from the handmade candles wrapped with branches to the cake pops displayed in sewing drawers to the silk ribbon that adorned the bride s bouquet. This was truly a creative collaboration, and I could not be more happy with the outcome! '

I called my nearby friend Phil and asked that he bring as many friends as he could to help. Turns out, most of these friends were not in any condition to help the morning after an  all nighter . The only person willing to help was Phil s friend, Dean.'

aS'Dean showed up with the biggest smile on his face and I specifically remember thinking to myself; now, this is the kind of man that I want to marry. I actually remember being upset after meeting him because I was under the impression that he was already taken. I guess I just assumed that someone this incredible and kind had to already be taken off the market. Turns out, he wasn t and I couldn t be more grateful. The week after we met, I went to my home state of Colorado to visit. Upon returning, I learned that Dean had been trying to get a hold of me, but was (without his knowledge) given the wrong number by our mutual friends. The next time I saw him, he was overly apologetic thinking that I hadn t returned his calls or texts because he was too forward. After assuring him that he just had the wrong number we finally went on our first date and have spent almost every single day together since.'

The girl is a legend..), so eventually they started doing workouts together.  Robert thought things were going pretty well, so he asked if Jessica would like to go out, and she flat out said no!  (But did apologize to Robert if she had led him on )  Robert explained,  After taking such a blow, I fell behind the scenes for a while only to reappear months later to spend more time with her biking or running. I eventually worked up the courage again (over a year later) to see if she would like to get to know each other again and to my delight she said, Sure   Since then weve been two peas in a pod.   (And as the photographers who have gotten to spend time with Jessica + Robert together, we can absolutely testify to the fact that these two are absolutely in love, and completely meant for each other!)'

S'The first and best choice we made was choosing Lauren Wakefield to be our photographer. When we met it was over a glass of sangria at a little pub in Chicago where we talked for hours like old friends. She shot our fantastic engagement photos first and made both of us feel way less awkward than we anticipated so by the time she shot our wedding it was a breeze! She has a talent that is rare to be seen, knowing how to capture the softest moments and make them feel real again when you see them in a photo. She is a true treasure and just a beautiful person inside out. I can tell you now she will be the one documenting every other important part of my life! (Sorry for your luck Lauren)'
p2630
aS'She gave us several referrals to local catering services, florists and bakeries which we chose with ease. Our baker, Mary did a phenomenal job on our beautiful dessert table from her homemade pies to the decadent carrot cake. They were all gone by the time I made my way over there so she must have done something right! Our florist, Jean and I also became fast friends exchanging tons of emails and calls so she could perfect our centerpieces and bouquets. She outdid herself. Not only were they breathtaking but just exactly what I was looking for.'
p2631
aS'The process of course could be stressful at times but one thing I can t repeat enough to brides is to let each step of the way be fun, don t get too down on yourself for forgetting something at home or getting a slightly different colored item than you thought. Also make it your own! We chose a venue that let us choose every vendor and do everything ourselves. Our wedding day went by in a blur just like everyone says it does, we even forgot to cut the cake! But it was completely magical. You don t realize how much people truly love you and support you until they trek three and a half hours to come for your special day! Remember the most important thing is that you are marrying this person who is going to be your everything and that you will always get through every stressful part that comes up because you are in it together.\n'

Starting off as friends first, by spring semester we were officially dating and in May of 2012 we were engaged. I grew up in New Jersey and Brian was raised in the Chicagoland area, so Chicago has played a huge role in cultivating our relationship as Brian has strong roots and is where I would frequently visit. In the past, I had visited Chicago with my family and can remember riding the Ferris wheel and falling with the romantic setting that was Navy Pier. Frank Sinatra s My Kind Of Town came over the speaker and I can remember saying to myself,  this is the perfect place to get engaged one day.  During one summer in the beginning of our relationship, I visited Brian where we rode the Ferris wheel together and I told him this story. Brian would later admit that it was in that moment he realized this was real and if our relationship continued, is where he would propose. As fate would have it, Six years later, he got down on one knee in one of the gondolas and asked me to marry him.'

My mom would eventually remarry and together we would create the most loving blended family but I still wanted to find a way for my dad to walk me down the aisle. Growing up, I kept a tie that reminded me of him in a box in my room after he passed away. So on our wedding day, I took that tie and wrapped it around my bouquet so that he could be with me. My mom walked me half way down the aisle where I then was joined by my step father until we met Brian at the end. All of our guests in attendance who are like family to us, understood this symbolized our path and how each person joined our lives in different stages.'

aS'We wanted our guests to feel enveloped in warmth which we ll admit, is hard to do in November in Chicago. To create this feeling, we decided on d cor which consisted of warm off-white flowers, mix metal floral vessels and more candles then I think the fire code actually allowed. The ceremony musicians played renditions of Coldplay, The Beatles and Adele songs so the room felt more like a family room. All of my bridesmaids being so wonderfully unique were able to select their favorite flower, all beautiful and exceptional just like them.'

S'From Michael and Anna Costa Photography Dan and Lauren met in December of 2008 in Kathmandu, Nepal, where they joined the same tour group to hike to Mt. Everest Base Camp.  Dan is originally from Birmingham, England, and Lauren is originally from Bakersfield, California (but was living in Los Angeles at the time), so it seemed like fate that they both happened to travel alone to the same distant city on the same dates with the same goal. These exotic circumstances meant that Dan & Lauren s first date was kind of a group date (there were 8 other travelers on the hike, plus guides and sherpas, who were with them at all times), and it lasted for almost 12 straight days.  Instead of the traditional flowers, the first gifts that Dan gave Lauren were a piece of string to tie her solar battery charger onto the back of her backpack, and an extra roll of toilet paper, since she had been suffering from food poisoning the first week of the hike and had run low on her own supply!  Since they had no privacy amongst the group on the hike (and no showers for 9 days of the trip), all they could do was walk, talk, laugh and learn a whole lot about one another.  Although Dan didn t work up the courage to make a romantic move until almost the end of their journey, they shared their first kiss in Lukla (high up in the Himalayas), and after the pair parted ways in Kathmandu on New Years  Eve, Dan was smitten enough that he booked a trip to California and came to visit Lauren in L.A. the week after she returned home. He met her parents on that trip, then she went straight back to England 2 weeks later to meet his family, and they realized things were serious.'

S'From The Bride I always say  it all started  with the bright indigo J. Crew sweater that Bronzon wore on an auspicious day in May 2010 because it caught my eye from a mile away. We met during the summer before our last year of college and started dating almost immediately. As those days of languor ended, we parted ways to finish college   Bronzon at UC Berkeley and I at University of Southern California. Even during the first months of long-distance dating, our lives moved in serendipitous lock step, which made it so much easier for us (and our love) to grow and mature together. Long story short, we both found jobs in the Bay Area (that even started on the same day). Then, the very same thing happened with our next jobs! After some time of both living and working in the heart of downtown San Francisco, in October 2013, we got engaged during a horseback ride on a sunny day in the thick of the Marin woodlands.'
p2905
aS'A May 3, 2014 wedding date put us on a 6-month timeline, so the planning process quickly commenced. I discovered that the modern bride s challenge is comprised largely of the limitless options she has to choose from. One choice that was easy to make for both of us, from the beginning, was the venue   Bronzon s parents  home. The Tudor style house in Bronzon s hometown of Chico, California, is nestled among lush greenery (meticulously groomed for the wedding by my father in law, who also strung lights, set up fountains, and handcrafted a tree swing, a wood block for our cake, and welcome banners for us), oak and willow trees, and best of all, a little lake with a dock   the perfect place to exchange our vows. Bronzon is the third of four siblings, the first two of whom had already been married at the house, but in different locations around the property; so, we were excited to follow this privilege of a family tradition.'
p2906
aS'Many of us would agree that mothers have a lifelong passion for nourishing us. Our mothers were no exception. When I mentioned to my mom that Bronzon and I wanted to serve a signature drink that reflected our combined tastes   a strawberry mojito mocktail   she promptly set up something like a chemistry lab in her kitchen and laboriously perfected the recipe with the help of my taste-testing dad in between the many weekly hour-and-a-half-long drives my dad and mom made to San Francisco for my dress fittings. My mother-in-law and legend of a baker, catered to every one of our dessert requests, which included not just homemade red velvet cake (complete with edible gold leaf detail) but also berry tarts, pecan tarts, and Bronzon s childhood favorite   strawberry rollup. For our guest favors, she made miniature strawberry jams.'

We met at a bar in West Los Angeles at 6pm for a few drinks, because we both had work the next day. Before I knew it, my stomach was sore from laughing and the bar was closing. Our first date flew by in an instant much like the next four years of our lives. We spent holidays together, took vacations together, and eventually moved to San Francisco together. As is true for most adults in their late 20s, life is hectic. Our one spot to slow down was Tom s family s ranch in Paso Robles, Spring Ranch. Tom grew up spending weekends and summers on the ranch and showed me his deep love of it. Growing up a country fan, this was a match made in heaven and I quickly shared his deep seeded love for the ranch. It was on the ranch where Tom proposed to me, and on the ranch where we held our wedding reception.'

S'From the Bride  Looking back, I m a little embarrassed that I didn t dress up more. It was my close friend s Super Bowl party, so what was the need? Little did I know my life would change forever after that Sunday. When I arrived I was greeted by many familiar faces. I settled in to watch the game, but mostly chat with my girlfriends. I noticed the unfamiliar face walk in immediately. I was introduced to Tom by an old friend telling me Tom was his newly single roommate. He smiled and casually introduced himself to the group. He was cute, really cute. But as quickly as he said hello, he quietly slipped out of the circle.  Well, so much for talking to the cute guy,  I thought. For the rest of the game, our only interactions were when we shimmied past each other in the hallway or chatting with the group. However, at some point, and sadly I can t remember exactly how, what was a group of five or six telling stories about their weekend, Tom and I were left alone talking and laughing. I was shocked. I wasn t shocked that we were speaking directly to each other; I was shocked at how comfortable I was talking to him. I went from hanging out with five of my lifelong friends to speaking to someone I d only know a few minutes and yet somehow I felt like I had known him my whole life. We did the predictable background Q&A and quickly discovered that we grew up less than 15 minutes from each other, had countless friends in common and shared numerous interests. Sadly, as great as the conversation was going, my ride was leaving so I said it was nice to meet him and gave him a moment to ask for my number. He promptly filled the moment with,  It was nice to meet you too. Hope you get home safe.  With that, Tom walked away. Needless to say I was disappointed and immediately blamed my casual Super Bowl attire. Like any party, leaving isn t fast. My thoughts of disappointment were erased with an,  Umm, hey,  from behind. I turned to see Tom standing there. In a cute, but nervous voice he said  Umm, so do you want to hang out sometime?  I played it cool,  Sure . Tom let out a great big smile but in a sarcastic tone, which I would grow to love, replied with,  Well, how about I give you my number, that way when you change your mind you don t have to deal a weird stalker? '
p3066
ag3061
aS' With over a year to plan, Tom and I wanted to be meticulous with every step we took. It was a no-brainer choosing Spring Ranch as our venue for the reception, as it was such a special place for us and Tom s family had hosted numerous weddings and events there. However, beyond that we were unsure. After doing extensive research and meeting with multiple wedding coordinators we were ecstatic when Percy Sales agreed to be our coordinator. The foundation of his vision was the same as ours, yet he brought so much experience and creativity that he was able to create something far more incredible than we could have dreamt. Everything Percy organized met our wish of an elegant country wedding. From the food, flowers and music to the table settings, lighting and countless other details; it was an absolute dream.'

aS' Since our May 2013 wedding, Tom and I have moved back down to the Pasadena area, adopted a dog, purchased a house and began new jobs. No matter how much things have changed since we first met four years ago, we still often find ourselves at 2am with aching smiles and asking what happened to the last 8 hours? Our dog thinks we re crazy.'

S'From the Bride  Baltic weather changes very fast. Bright sun showed up in the morning, but heavy rain started after, just at that moment when our guests arrived. But we were not upset about it at all! We met with friends at lunch time, and everyone participated in decorating the dinner hall, lounge-zone and guest-book place. Actually we brought a suitcase full of decorative elements. After lunch everyone changed to cocktail dresses and we arranged fun photo sessions with guests. Our bridesmaid wore colorful dresses and groomsmen wore color bow-ties. After dinner, we released sky lanterns. It was a touching moment! Later that night we had an informal party in a cocktail bar with fun dancing.\n'

When we got engaged, it seemed only natural that we would celebrate our marriage in the place where we met, fell in love, and now call home together.'

aS'When we started looking at venues, our main objective was to find something where we could hold both our ceremony and reception, with plenty of outdoor space to enjoy the beautiful, late-summer climate of Tuscany. Villa Montefiano, a 16th century residence nestled on a hillside overlooking Florence, was the perfect fit. Not only was the villa itself gorgeous, but it offered a number of lush gardens and terraces that we could utilize for our celebration.'
p3306
aS'Our ceremony took place just before sunset; the golden light, gentle breeze, and Tuscan backdrop created an almost ethereal effect. My husband said his vows in Italian and I said mine in English. It not only made the ceremony understandable for both Italian and English-speaking guests, but also gave us the opportunity to express something so meaningful to one another in our first languages. I remember feeling so happy to have married such a wonderful man, surrounded by our loved ones above the city where it all began.\n'

p3418
aS'I wanted to use soft romantic colors, a tried and true color scheme certainly, used by many brides before me, but I also wanted to capture the laid back earthiness of the outdoors that Joe and I love so much. Juxtaposing more earthy elements like moss, stone and succulents with soft garden roses, ivory lace and blush colored silks was critical in making this balance a reality. It was a casual elegance I was looking for, but something unique, something enchanted. I wanted the style to be textured and spirited. We wanted to strike an intriguing, exciting cord in our style for our guests, and for us! And of course, we wanted to incorporate all kinds of personal touches! The lace overlay for the cake table in particular is a family heirloom, made by my grandmother and great- grandmother for my parent?s wedding forty two years ago. My sister also used this on her cake table and it was finally my turn. This linen demanded something special be placed on it, and I turned to no other than Maureen Thie for this task. Her family owned the original Virginia Bakery and although she no longer was making cakes for private events, my mother s persistent begging payed off. Mo had also made my sisters cake years ago.'

We didn t even tell our wedding party this video was going down. Talk about a tear jerker! Arriving early at the French House also gave us a chance to get a sneak peak into how Courtenay Lambert and her team had transformed this venue into something spectacular. I had met with more florists than I could count, and from the moment I met Courtenay I knew she was the exact one I had been searching for! I followed my heart when it came to assembling our team of venders and I really feel the approach paid off. Even a few last minute changes, albeit a bit stressful, helped to ensure that everything and everyone felt  right . So glad I went with printed flower girl dresses!'

S'From The Bride Andrew and I met at one of my best friend s weddings in Los Olivos, California. After strategically being placed at the same table, through a little bit of conversation we realized that we both had relatives back in Dallas, Texas. Over Christmas when we were visiting our families, we went on our fist date and we immediately knew there was something deeper there. I picked the coffee house we met at finding out later that this was a test to see if I would go major corporation or local business. I am glad he cares about these things and also glad that I had already gotten my coffee chain fix that morning!'

Grace asked for elegant, timeless and romantic and this wedding at the Hyatt Regency O Hare was all of the above and more. Getting wed at St. Vincent DePaul Church under the magnificent altar, to sneaking away in Lincoln Park for portraits and the stunning details at the Hyatt Regency   Grace and Jeff s day was nothing short of perfection. One of the sweetest couples I have ever had the pleasure of getting to know, Grace and Jeff deserve the love and happiness they so clearly bring to each other. With family and friends coming from all across the globe to celebrate their love it was a day to remember. I am so SO happy for you both and wish you a lifetime of love together!'

Apparently Andrew had also been hearing my name from my best friend s now-husband. After graduating from the University of Michigan, I moved back to Seattle and in with my best friend. Andrew must have heard my name one last time, since out of the blue he contacted me and slowly we developed a really great social media, then phone relationship. We had been dying to meet and a couple months later while I was in Michigan visiting my sister and he was playing baseball in Akron, Ohio, I did what anyone would do and drove 2.5 hours south to the middle of nowhere (at least that I had ever been), to meet this Dobies guy for our first date. When my nerves finally wore off, we found this magical little park in the middle of nowhere and spent hours matching each other s faces and expressions to the voices we were used to only hearing.

S'From the beautiful Bride People are always surprised to hear that though we re high school sweethearts, we didn t actually go to the same high school! We first met at Irvine Chinese School, where we emceed the annual Chinese New Year Festival together. We spent several months practicing nearly every day for this event. At first, we were a little shy, and consciously avoided eye contact with each other. A few practices in, though, we decided that if we were going to be spending so much time over the next few months that we might as well get to know each other! That was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'
p3715
aS'We sat near the edge, with a wonderful view of our street. Michael started talking about our nine year journey together, and Jenn was joking around with him (because she was totally oblivious about what was happening). Very early on in our relationship, Jenn asked Michael  who she was to him  and during his  speech,  Michael described how she came to be the supportive, warm, and loving person that he loved. Jenn only started catching on when he started describing who he hoped she would be in the future and just as she began to suspect something was happening, Michael was on one knee, asking her to marry him! Jenn said something like  of COURSE I ll marry you!  and would later wish she had said something more elegant!'
p3716
aS'We were hoping for something intimate, though we knew that our guest list would end up being much bigger. So, our vision for the wedding was something less formal, not in the typical ballroom, and could feel casual, intimate, yet momentous all at the same time. We had hoped for at least part of the wedding to be outdoors and ended up choosing to do the ceremony at Crossline Community Church, and the reception outdoors at Shady Canyon Golf Club. We had toyed with the idea of using tents but ultimately, decided on string lighting. Jenn s friend showed her a picture of some lanterns, and given that we both loved the idea and the look, that was immediately incorporated into our plans.'
p3717
aS'As for colors, our immediate thought was blue and green, our two favorite colors. After much Pinterest boarding, though, Jenn suggested something truly out of character switching to navy blue and blush. Michael, surprisingly, liked this idea better, so that was that!'
p3718
aS'Jenn knows that she is not very decisive, and that her opinion of how things look is sometimes too easily swayed by price. So, she took someone whose taste she trusted unequivocally her future husband! Jenn thought it was as much her dress as his, and honestly wanted his input. We went to several shops, in California and in DC, and found  the dress  the Augusta Jones Juno. Unfortunately, it was a bit over budget so Jenn (ever-resourceful) found a never-worn one online at a third of the price, and had it altered in DC.'

S'From Nicodem Creative  There is a certain marriage of timeless strength and graceful beauty in the city of Chicago, IL. From the stone and steel skyscrapers that tower over Michigan Avenue to the curving lake shore dotted with bobbing sailboats, it is a city built for classic, elegant affairs. When we met with Robby and Tala a few months before the special day to discuss their hopes and dreams, that was the plan they proposed: a vintage, jazz filled, history-inspired, Old Chicago wedding. And it did not disappoint.'

aS'From The Bride  Robby and I met at a wedding in Miami, FL. A year later, he called me out of the blue and we began getting to know each other while I was living in Detroit and he in Chicago. After nine months of long phone conversations, lengthy car rides and flights to see each other, Robby proposed on his family s farm in Western Kansas. I moved to Chicago shortly after and had eight months to plan our big day!'

We were brought together under trying circumstances when both of our fathers had passed away. Tom and I were introduced on a particularly painful day during a funeral, but were still able to find comfort, strength, and love in each other. Since that bittersweet day in our childhood, we have experienced so many beautiful things and our relationship has flourished. We truly believe that our meeting was fate, perhaps arranged by our loved ones above. After fifteen years together, we are so happy to finally be married.'

S'To set the scene, you need to know a couple of things. Meghan meticulously planned most of our Chicago wedding from Tacoma, Washington, alongside completing a Masters in Occupational Therapy. Like most of the events in our eight-year relationship, it proved a challenge, but one immersed in ideas based on our love and experiences together and I have to take this opportunity to congratulate her on an amazing job.'
p3921
aS'When planning the wedding, we knew there were a couple of areas we wanted to get absolutely right, and the pictures was one of them. We researched long and hard and met several Chicago-area photographers before finally deciding on Hannah. Before meeting her, we already loved her style and the exceptional results she had produced at previous weddings from viewing her impressive website. However, within minutes of being in her company, Meghan and I both knew Hannah was the perfect fit, especially given the amazing energy and enthusiasm she brings to her undoubted talent.'
p3922
aS'From Hannah Persson  So many little pieces added to this beautiful wedding. Shane, the groom, is from Ireland, where Meghan, the bride, actually first met him! They fell in love, and Shane moved back here to the States. When guests travel far from other countries, it always seems like the celebration is that much more beautiful. The groom s dad actually worked on the awesome yellow VW for about a week straight before the wedding just so that Shane and Meghan would be able to make their getaway in it. It had extra special significance because the car belonged to the bride s father, who passed away several years ago. One of Meghan s friend designed the gorgeous invitations. The guest s table cards showed off the couples  love for travel, as did the table numbers, as each had a different post card from a different travel destination for the couple. The couple used to live in Washington state, so the wood underneath the flowers on the tables was from Washington. The bride scoured thrift stores to find all the beautiful and unique vases to hold the flowers   super creative! The groom loves photography, so there were lots of old cameras decorating the reception space. The beautiful old Victorian elegance paired perfectly with the eclectic set up of the reception space. The couple loves music, so they had a banjo and violin player during cocktail hour, then the amazing Lisa Rene Band, followed by a special song played by a guest on the accordian. Of course, the late night snack was fish and chips- also super cute! The photoshoot took place at Fabyan Gardens in St. Charles, which is beyond gorgeous with the arches and gates. So much prettiness and love packed into one day.'

S'From Athena Kalindi Photography  This New York City couple planned a destination wedding in Yosemite with only 12 people in attendance. The government shut down, but the couple still came to California (they were supposed to get married at the Ahwahnee Hotel) and the hotel offered for them to move the wedding to the Tenaya Lodge outside of the park. With hope the park may open, the couple stayed at the Tenaya and waited until October 13th  with no movement from the government, the park was still closed. The couple decided to get dressed and attempt a park wedding anyhow! We said we were moving through to cross the park, but once inside the rangers sort of looked the other way while we spent hours alone in the vast and immense beauty of Yosemite (including being the only people at The Ahwahnee!)! After a few hours of portraits, we met the rest of the wedding party along the side of the road and conducted the ceremony. It was absolutely flawless   and the couple ended up with the wedding of their dreams.'

S'I first met my husband Yves while I was in Chicago. He was visiting from Switzerland, and I from Naples, Florida. We exchanged email addresses, but I wasn t really thinking too much of the whole thing and then he emailed. Short emails turned into daily tomes turned into gmail chats and then five hour long Skype sessions. Soon I was traveling to Italy for work and Italy just happens to be right next to Switzerland! :) Our first  date  (if you don t count all the Skype sessions) was in Lake Como. Not too long after our time in Italy, Yves quit his job and moved his whole life to Florida. Before I knew it, we were engaged. We couldn t have made this up   it was too extraordinary   reminding the both of us that God writes the best stories '
p4085
aS'That line,  God writes the best stories,  became a sort of theme for our wedding. We wanted to celebrate the fact that we had an international tale for which we were so grateful. :) We enlisted a lot of professional help, as you can see from the list above, but I was really excited to take part and carry certain elements/metaphors throughout the planning. The design on the envelope liner was a map with a thread and a heart linking Switzerland and Florida. Our tables were designated with names of towns of places we d been together and photos we d taken. Because almost of all our guests were traveling to Florida (Naples is not the original home of either of us), from all parts of the US, Canada, Switzerland, and even Australia, we really wanted to show our gratitude to them for sharing in our day. We made guest bags (with the help of dear local friends!) filled with homemade granola, muffins, Swiss chocolates (for Yves), oranges (for Florida) and Naples  magazines. We also love this quote from C.S. Lewis about a  secret thread  which unites certain people. We made sure that from the design of the invitation, to the program, to the guest book (a dictionary!), to the favors, there was a  secret thread  throughout.'

S'To play up the party vibe and compliment the raw materials in our venue, we chose rich colors like sapphire navy, ox blood red florals and gold metallic accents. There were no rules to any of the details   we just made sure we asked ourselves at every decision point if this was staying true to who we were. That method took the pressure off doing what was  in  or what our other engaged friends were doing. In the end, the evening felt cohesive and we regretted none of our decisions. For the ceremony, Aaron and I wanted to create an atmosphere of inclusion and unity, and used several elements to pull this together. Tea lights lined the walls and an assortment of hurricane candles were placed at the  altar  space. '
p4127
aS'Friends and family were asked to sit where they felt comfortable; readings were both secular and spiritual. Our close friend officiated the ceremony and incorporated personal anecdotes into his marriage address. That, while being surrounded by family and friends, lead to a powerful and moving experience and absolutely the best part of the day. As we were announced husband and wife, our guests blew New Year s Eve paper horns as a celebratory tribute to how we met. The Ravenswood Event Center s Industrial Ballroom had the perfect space for a  strolling cocktail party.  The center used passed dishes, food stations and carted treats to keep the flow moving. Andy and Jen at REC dreamed up a menu that reflected our tastes (which is anything but fancy) but added a creative spin (think grilled leek and shrimp quesadillas, and honey and prosciutto white sauce flatbread). Even though it was a cocktail party, our guests left stuffed and couldn t stop talking about the food. I wanted to be very hands-on with the wedding crafts but for projects beyond my capabilities I enlisted the help of some very talented and creative family and friends. '
p4128
aS'Other personal touches included wrapping my bouquet with my late grandmother s handkerchief, using my mother s ring pillow (with our embroidered wedding date below her s) and using my late grandma s blue bird pin as my  something blue.  Even our dessert table included frosting shots (tiny cups of vanilla frosting) as it is oddly my favorite treat from the bakery. Aaron s dad has long personal ties to Superdawg and made sure the famous Chicago dogs were served as a late night snack. At the end of the night, our guests were treated to an assortment of our favorite sweets which they could enjoy on their way home. The day was unforgettable and emotionally overwhelming in the best way possible. We couldn t be more grateful for the love of our family and friends, and the talent and care of our vendors. '

So with that, we did! It is so wonderful to have the trust of a couple right at the start. Verbal permission to follow our artistic eye, and to not let anything hinder that, pushed us to make these wonderful images we are so proud of.'

aS'We met Kate at her family farm in Rockford for getting ready. The ceremony was at St. Anthony of Padua church also in Rockford. A bit of rain on the way to Orchard Ridge Farms had us worrying about portraits. Of course, the second Kate and Greg arrived, the clouds parted to reveal a beautiful day. It was perfect for exploring the idyllic grounds. Kate took off her shoes, Greg danced and we watched the loving fun of this couple through our lenses.'

We wanted something sweet and genuine that showed off our personalities and my love for design and creativity. I loved the planning process and enjoyed adding elements that were truly one of a kind. The style of our day was whimsical, sophisticated, and a little sassy.'

aS'We currently live in Toronto, Canada, but we re originally from the Midwest. We always thought it would be nice to have our celebration in Rocheport (population 243) because it s such a charming town full of Bed & Breakfasts, with galleries, antique shops, and even a blacksmith. Many guests stayed within three blocks of each other. The mayor baked our pizzas at the general store for the rehearsal dinner, and together we walked down the cobblestone streets before walking down the aisle. We chose to have the wedding a couple miles up the road at Les Bourgeois Winery. The bluff top overlooking the Missouri River was an ideal ceremony location, showcasing how truly beautiful Missouri can be. The rustic terrace inside the winery served as the setting for our quaint reception while Ironweed, a local bluegrass band, provided the tunes on the bluff for the ceremony and cocktail hour. In designing the invitations, I was inspired by the venue, and I really wanted to emphasize its location on the river. We served pies from our favorite shop in our hometown, which was special since we spent many date nights chatting over a slice of chocolate cheesecake.'
p4207
aS'For the florals, I had something a little different in mind. While in college, I worked at Poppy, a jewelry and art boutique in downtown Columbia, Mo. It was there that I met another artist and now dear friend, Lili Johnstone of D fy. She made every single paper flower for our wedding by hand. She spent months and hundreds of hours making these one of a kind masterpieces into bouquets, centerpieces, and everything in between. I am so thankful for her hard work, and I admire her persistence on this project! As you can imagine, planning a wedding from another country had its challenges, but knowing Lili was in charge was such a huge stress reliever.'

aS'I wanted my dress to be something comfortable that was easy to dance in since I knew we d be breakin  it down all night! There is a dress shop called The Brides  Project in Toronto. They sell gently used, donated gowns, and all of their profits go to various cancer charities. I loved this idea! I ended up finding a discontinued style that I had pinned, and it was truly meant to be. I was alone at the shop (which is a house filled with dresses), so I frantically texted my mom and best friend for reassurance before the purchase. The sweet high-low gown perfectly framed my mint heels. I topped it off with a sparkly blush shrug from BHLDN and a custom fascinator from Lilliput Hats in Toronto. The beautiful bridesmaids chose their own dresses, and despite the fact that we had never all been in one location until the day before the wedding, everything coordinated perfectly.'

S'From the Bride  Jason and I met through our mutual friends, Jimmy and Lily, and we had our first date in Lisbon, Portugal   Really! Jimmy and Lily were recent newlyweds and were kind enough to invite the two us individually to join them on their honeymoon to Portugal and Spain. Leading up to the trip, we would hear tidbits about each other, but only briefly met a few times. At first glance we seemed so different from one other, that I didn t see anything past a good, fun loving friendship. But that quickly changed. Immediately landing in Portugal, I saw how caring and protective Jason was. He swept me off my feet with his kind and caring heart and we share the same love for life, travel and adventure. We had a wonderful time together on that trip and we ve since added Greece, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, New York and other domestic destinations and road trips to our list of travels together. Four years later, he proposed during a Christmas party we were hosting. Posing as neighborhood carolers, Jason s friends from his old church rang the doorbell and sang some holiday jingles. We all piled out onto the porch decorated with string lights and candles when they began singing  Marry Me  by Train which is one of my most favorite songs. After the song finished, Jason got down on one knee and the rest is history. I was completely surprised and elated! It was the perfect proposal since we were surrounded by our family and friends.'

S'From the Bride Rob and I knew we wanted to have an intimate and fun wedding, and we wanted it to be as stress free as possible, enter Nira from Amber Events! We live in New York, so planning a wedding cross country was a daunting task, but with Nira s help and my mom and best friends we were able to put together a truly special day. Rob and I fell in love with the Smog Shoppe because it was an awesome combination of industrial elements mixed with the beautiful succulent garden and a Vintage flair- it felt like us! The whole theme of the wedding was combining things that on paper aren t supposed to go together like burlap and lace and succulents and roses. My mother started collecting old tins and tea pots and our incredible florist Gilly filled them with yellow flowers and succulents that were in season. Our ceremony was very special and non traditional, our officiants were my brother and Rob s step mother and we wrote the whole thing ourselves, including many different traditions as possible. We stood under a chuppah made by one of my bridesmaids out of old and handkerchiefs and remembrances given to us from our families. We wanted our guests to feel like they were at our home for a back yard bbq so the food had to be great! Heirloom more than delivered, we had burgers and tacos and farmers market fresh salads. Neither Rob or I have ever liked cake but we love pie, so we got a variety of incredible pies from Porch Pies and decorated them with fun novelty cake toppers. The band was very important to Rob since he is a musician himself (we met at one of his gigs) and Nira suggested Dustbowl Revival- an great bluegrass/rock and roll band based in LA- they were so good that a few of our guests went to see them play the following night! We tried to incorporate as many fun details as possible, vintage fans to use during the ceremony in case it was hot and yellow and green pashminas for when the sun went down. We had an old fashioned photo booth and used that for our guest book. And we also made wedding mad libs which were so much fun to read later. Our wedding ended up being everything we wanted, intimate and fun and a great party!\n'

We met up with my uncle and cousin who accompanied us and 20 other strangers on this organized trip. I met Dan that first morning when he introduced himself as one of three trip leaders and handed me my bike for the week. I thought nothing of it. As the week progressed, the leaders biked and ate with the group, guiding us on our tour of the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. There was some flirtation going on, but I was not interested or looking at the time. I had just moved out to Seattle, WA from Columbus, OH days earlier hoping to jump start my career. Besides, growing up it was always my sister who attracted all the attention. I figured that would be the case here as well.'

I only tried on about five dresses before  the one . I absolutely fell in love with my Anna Maier gown   it was perfect for the season. There were certainly challenges planning a Columbus wedding while I was living in Seattle, so I could not have been more happy for my mom when she paired up with Adrianne from Adrianne Elizabeth Events for planning.

After nearly eight years together, I finally walked down the aisle towards the love of my life and my best friend. I was 20 years old when I met Aaron (he was 28), and I knew the moment I met him that, in every sense of the word, I would grow old with him one day.'

But, like most young loves, we split up and went our separate ways before college, only to find ourselves randomly reunited seven years later. It took a lot of courage for me to go up and say hi to Andy the bartender. I hate admitting it, I shook like a leaf, but he stuttered and couldn t find words. So, we ll call it even!'

S'We re big fans of all parties in the wedding category, including a fabulous inspiration shoot. But what you are about to see is something that warmed my heart like no other soiree has ever done. White Dress Events and Jamie May Photography set out to pull together a gorgeous shoot, inspired by the 1920 s   already a good start. But when they found a very deserving couple (a must read, see below) to act as models, they turned the whole shindig around and threw this lovely bride a surprise vow renewal. September s Bride gussied her up right, and her husband of twenty years couldn t stop smiling. You won t be able to either, after one look here.'
p4647
aS' Planning a photo shoot is a lot like planning a wedding, and given that so much time and work was going to be devoted to this shoot, I really wanted to make it count by choosing models who were a real couple and who deserved a day of pampering. Jamie and I went on the hunt. We didn t have to search too far to meet John and Tracey Weatherwax. John and Tracey have such a beautiful and inspiring love story. They just celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary (can you believe it they look so young) and NEVER had a wedding. Their story goes a bit like this: John and Tracey met right after they graduated from high school. John was headed off to the Army and Tracey was off to college but they fell in love quickly. The spent a lot of time writing letters back and forth and it was in one of those letters that John first told Tracey he wanted to marry her. After several months, John got his assignment with the Army and it was taking him to Germany. He of course did not want to leave Tracey behind so he put on his best suit and some cologne, got down on one knee and asked her to marry him on a payphone! She said yes. They were married in a civil service with only her dad and sister as witnesses. They always said that one day they would have a wedding. Well many things happened over the next 20 years that kept pushing that dream off. They spent a few years in Germany, and then headed back to the US all while Tracey was trying to finish college. Finally they decided to begin their family and unfortunately discovered that they were unable to have children. Of course this was heartbreaking for both of them but they always believed that there was a bigger plan for them. John and Tracey decided that they would adopt and became an instant family of five when they adopted their three sons all at once! You can imagine that with three busy boys, that dream of a wedding was put on the back burner for a really long time.'

I met her halfway up to the bridal suite to get things back on track and told her all that mattered in that moment was the kind groom waiting for her at the alter. And that we would find the ring no matter what. Her Dad held her hand, she shook her head, wiped away a few tears and together they trekked down the thirty plus stairs to the 250 awaiting guests. The ceremony began at long last and the show went on.'

Needless to say, we got along swimmingly, and after some chatting, I discovered they were from Madison   where I was going to be moving in a few short months.

So, it made sense to us to really highlight Madison as the place where we settled down to begin our life together.'

Chris and I met and live in San Francisco, so we wanted the wedding to in the city, in a venue that was indoor, but special. When we saw the Spanish Suite of the Clift Hotel, it almost felt as if it were custom made for our wedding. Between the warm redwood, the sparkling chandeliers and the Philippe Starck chair covers, it was absolutely gorgeous. The fact that it opened onto a tented patio that overlooked the lights of downtown San Francisco made it truly perfect.'

We had weathered through it and I was calm because everything felt right and it felt good. Life was great!'

S'From The Bride Set on a rainy October day, our wedding tied together all the fairytale moments that I hoped for on our special day. The locations of our ceremony and reception seemed to fit perfectly with our close ties to home, and our love of nature and the outdoors. Marc and I met and fell in love in Colorado. After an injury to my foot from running, I wanted to learn how to swim for exercise. He gave me swim lessons for a couple of years until he went away to grad school in Arizona. We spoke on the phone for hours talking about our dating life and giving one another advice. Marc would come back to visit on his breaks from school. Over the course of the 6 years that we knew one another, we became very close friends and eventually fell in love when Marc injured his back on a visit to Colorado, and was immobile on my floor for weeks.'

aS'We drove to a pier at Lake Michigan afterwards to take some photographs in front of the water. Even though it was raining, there was something really peaceful about being at the lake front and breathing the fresh air. It was a way for us to tie in our love of the water, and spend a few moments reflecting. It s one of the moments I remember very vividly despite all the chaos of a wedding day. I remember feeling really refreshed by the crispness of the Fall air coming off the water. Just to look out on the water with the one I love felt like the best thing ever. It was a very special moment.'

aS'Tara and Nick were married on a beautiful summer day in the bride s hometown of Stevensville, Michigan. She wore a form-fitting lace Enzoani gown, he wore a custom-made Abbeydale suit. They exchanged their own vows in St. John Catholic Church in nearby Benton Harbor, followed by a fairy-tale reception at her parents  home on Lake Michigan; the same beautiful, special spot Nick proposed. Tiki torches scattered the property, a vintage crystal chandelier hung from a 75 year old Oak tree over the dance floor, and music, laughter, and the sound of waves and dune grass blowing in the summer breeze set the fun and romantic tone of the evening.'

It was there, in the rolling green hills of a country they both felt drawn to, that they fell in love. Their lust for life, exploration, trying new things and meeting new people bonded these two together.'

S'From the Bride  Kalen and I always knew that we wanted to have our wedding in Chicago. After all, we met in the city and have always thrived on the urban hustle and bustle. Since The Ivy Room is situated in the heart of downtown, it seemed the perfect choice. But it wasn t until we toured the space, nestled between the State Street shops and Medinah Temple, that we became truly inspired. The courtyard was a metropolitan oasis, and we decided at that moment that we had to have an outdoor ceremony. One of our first design decisions was our chuppah, made of floating white lilies. This was the focal point of our ceremony, and it looked absolutely magical in front of the rich green ivy-covered brick edifice. At the end of the cocktail hour, Kalen and I snuck upstairs to the reception hall, opened the big French doors overlooking the courtyard, and gave a champagne toast to all of our family and friends. I truly felt like a princess up on that balcony! '

Another great find was an old metal fabric panel that was purchased from an antique textile shop in Paris; I was able to use this as the backdrop for our photobooth!'

aS'The wedding took place on September 2, 2012 at one of our clients  residences in Beverly Hills, California. We were incredibly lucky to have such generous clients; we could not believe it when they offered their home to us for our wedding. It seemed like a dream come true to be married in a situation similar to how we met (this was the latest project that had just been completed by both our companies). We held the ceremony in the front yard and the reception in the back. We were initially a little worried that the lawn area in the front was not large enough, but the setting ended up being astonishingly beautiful. Our wedding planner, Nancy, suggested having a circular ceremony that would feel intimate and also maximize our space. My most magical memory of the day was stepping out of the house into a circle of guests waiting in the front yard. It was truly breathtaking   standing underneath a canopy of trees with garlands of flowers hanging all around us, surrounded on all sides by our friends and family.'

We met the gifted Sam Johnson on the streets of San Francisco, and he graced us with his uncanny John Mayer sounding voice as he charismatically entertained during cocktail hour and performed our first dance song. Surprisingly, even though it was very entertainment driven, I expected other parts of the wedding to take a back seat, they didn t, we got compliments left and right that it was the best wedding food many of the guest ever had!'

aS'My advice:\n 1) Hire a wedding planner. Best decision I made. I truly had the most amazing stress free day. The day was relaxed, and so slow, I got to enjoy every single second of it and really soak it in. I sat and played the piano for hours and reflected while someone else ran around solving problems.\n 2) I didn t want a videographer but my patient recommended Cloudless to us, and I figured, well we do have a very active, movement based wedding, I ll give it a shot. Boy  amazing decision, it is a video you can relive over and over and to have moving pictures of the most amazing day, that for many couples is over in the blink of an eye, a video helps that day last forever.\n 3) Make choices that satisfy you and your partner. In the end, this is your day, yes of course be kind and courteous to others opinions, but choose a photographer that shares your artistic style as you ll look at those picture for decades, choose the dress you feel stunning in, choose the people you want standing by your side, be true to the two of you and take the time to enjoy this amazing time in your lives.\n 4) Oh  consider doing a boudoir shot with onelove photography and presenting it to your groom as your gift, it is a fun day for you filled with pampering and feeling sexy and it is certainly something that your partner will enjoy for years to come.'

S'From the Bride  David and I met at a dive bar in Denver. I had just moved to Denver a few months before from Chicago and my roommates had convinced me to go out on the town. I remember seeing David across the bar and thinking he was handsome. David came up to me a bit later and told me that I looked familiar. I let him probe with questions for a bit but having just moved there I knew it was unlikely we had met before. I thought that it had been a cute pick up line though! Later David told me this was the pick up line his brother had used on his future wife and that is why he had used it. Somehow during our conversation we ended up talking about my favorite ice cream in Denver (salted oreo, so good) and we made a date to get some the next night. Our ice cream date lasted into the morning hours talking under the stars. I called my Mom the next day and told her I had met the man I was going to marry. David and I saw each other the next 10 days in a row and the rest is beautiful, ice cream filled history.'

S'From the beautiful Bride Given our courtship, which spanned years and continents, our wedding could be anything but typical. From the day we got engaged, we were torn between eloping and having a stereotypically grandiose Indian ceremony, between having something local and accessible rather than something remote and intimate   these are, of course, decisions we never had to make in full, instead indulging ourselves with our favorite parts of each.  We settled on Kauai for our reception because, despite our constantly connected careers and lives, we wanted somewhere completely cut off from technology. Somewhere you don t really need GPS because there s only one road, and where you aren t worried about your bandwidth affecting Netflix streaming quality because you can hardly stay indoors. With endless beaches surrounding lush tropical forests, Kauai seemed like the most remote yet visually rich landscape within several thousand miles of home. It also incorporated my husband s love of the outdoors as well as the preternatural comfort I take in flora and natural beauty.'
p5647
aS'In Dallas, we wanted to make sure to incorporate all the things we couldn t bring with us to Kauai   in addition to bridal mendhi from my sister-in-law Kiran Meghani of KM Henna Artistry, we had the nikkah ceremony in our local mosque (where we coincidentally met for the first time fifteen years earlier), and celebrated both events with some authentic, spicy indian cuisine. We were told to prepare for some interesting and unpredictable weather in Kauai, supposedly the wettest island, but nothing could have prepared us for snow and freezing rain in Dallas   it certainly made us feel loved that our guests braved that weather to celebrate with us.  Once we escaped the Texas frost to sunny Kauai, we were in the able hands of our wedding planner, Morgan Childs, of Moana Events. She really helped us articulate a vision that brought together our eclectic styles and taste into something truly one-of-a-kind. The residence at Na Aina Kai s botanical gardens proved to be the perfect backdrop for our welcome dinner, providing ample space for Bollywood dancing and East African barbecue.  Despite ample rain the entire week, the clouds parted at 3pm, giving way to the sun just minutes before our afternoon ceremony. The style and decor provided by Martin Roberts, in the elegant tent from Kauai tents, were beyond compare   capturing every aesthetic we had both imagined. The dancing and festivities were broken up by an incredible dinner from Contemporary Flavors as well as breathtaking Tahitian and Fire Knife dance performances from Urahutia Productions.  After the wedding, the things we remember fondest are the things that went against plan   the rain, the mud, the groom losing his ring (don t ask). We can scarcely remember the sublime, captivating moments and scenes that Fawne and Sebastian of Sea Light Studios captured so perfectly. Every detail from place settings to floral arrangements to beverage stations reflected our vision perfectly, and the time Morgan took to really understand us before executing really made a difference   the entire affair was perfectly reflective of us.  We re now left with a special attachment to Kauai unlike any other place, as this remote tropical paradise, for one weekend, became  ours    and thanks to the memories, it will forever remain that way.\n'

The room looked effortlessly gorgeous and fit perfectly with their personalities, style, and story. Emily s pinwheels were found as both decor and escort cards, leading guests to their tables. Friends and family wrote well wishes to the couple on Jenga pieces, so that Emily and JT can reread the happy notes every time they play.

aS'From The Bride  For our wedding day, we envisioned an elegant, classic, and intimate affair   with a nod to European glamor and vintage chic. We live in London and were engaged in Paris, and wanted to honor these experiences on our big day. I chose a 1950s long-sleeved lace gown and satin Fendi heels to pay homage to my Italian heritage and love of fashion and vintage silhouettes; Brian wore a petrol-blue, 3-piece Paul Smith Bespoke suit to honor traditional English tailoring, along with Paul Smith shoes, a Gucci tie and Falke socks (all in reference to his travels). I incorporated a brooch on my bouquet that belonged to my late grandmother, and carried my father s handkerchief   my something  borrowed  and  blue  as it was ink-stained   that also belonged to my late grandfather. Brian wore antique cufflinks that I bought him for our first Christmas together in 2009. Surrounded by our closest family and friends, we were married on the campus of Indiana University (my alma mater) and celebrated with a wonderful dinner provided by IMU Catering. We chose a palette of white, cream and blush to compliment the winter season, with accents of navy to pick up the tones in Brian s suit. Our first dance song was  Si tu vois ma m re  by Sidney Bechet, which is the theme song to the movie  Midnight in Paris , one of our favorite films. We worked with the Beck Chapel organist to tailor our music choices   while the welcome music was traditional Baroque, we had U2 s  All I Want Is You , Sigur Ros s  Untitled 3  and The Beatles   All You Need Is Love  set to the organ for the bridal party processional, the bride s processional, and the recessional, respectively. Our entrance song was a live jazz rendition of Steely Dan s  Peg . All of these little details came together to make for an incredible day, but for us, the best moment was seeing each other in the chapel as the music played   after this, time stopped and the rest is history!\n'

Their wedding day was a testament to that magnetism   and to how full their lives are now and how impossibly full they will grow to be. On a sunny day in June they met on a dock, in the wind and said I love you. I can t wait to marry you. That wind played with Maria s veil and their favorite people laughed and cheered them on (as did many boaters motoring by during the lake side ceremony) and they just sort of melted into a perfect day to say I Do.

As luck would have it, the rain started coming down almost the exact moment that Devina (the bride) stepped out of the Parisian Cab. That didn t matter for a second though, clear umbrellas with their initials were passed out to the guests and as the gorgeous bride accompanied by her equally gorgeous 7-year-old daughter danced down the grassy aisle, the world was perfect, rain drops and all. The spirit of their flower girl stole the show in her etsy-bought dress that she chose all her own. '

We wanted our wedding to be romantic and traditional yet unstuffy, and to reflect what we both love so much about California. Having our reception at Casa Del Mar, an oceanfront hotel rich in Santa Monica history was the perfect fit. Our color scheme of blush pink, white and gold ran through all aspects of the event from our invitations to the bridesmaid dresses to the florals. Our bouquets and arrangements also had plenty of greenery in them which helped to lend a lush, California-casual vibe to the decor. It was really important to us that our guests, many of whom had flown in from other countries, have an amazing time and our band did a great job of getting everyone up and dancing from the second the reception started to the last song of the night.\n'

S'From the photographer  Christine & Todd already have a long & winding love story that starts with them becoming best friends in college at Marquette in Milwaukee. It took awhile for them to realize that best-friendship would equal partnership, but once it hit home it really hit home. For the last several years they have lived in his hometown of Chicago where Christine worked downtown and Todd commuted an incredible 70 miles to work and back to her because where she is is where he needs to be. Todd played final four basketball at Marquette, professionally in Europe and is taking the lead in spiriting the two of them off on a new adventure as he recently accepted a new coaching position at a university. And Christine is happy to accompany him, even though it might mean passing the bar in a new state. '

Christine s sister recently found out she has cancer and was undergoing treatment soon before the wedding. Thankfully she was up to the task of being a matron of honor despite the treatment and was by Christine s side throughout the day.

His sweet tooth sure never minds! I adore their feminine colors {light pink & mint green} and delicious macarons. This is where our wedding inspiration began. My mom s friend, graphic designer Kim Jackson of MiTags, designed our wedding logo. We wanted it to be classic and preppy with a twist of French  chic.  We went to France for our honeymoon {and multiple Laduree locations!) so it all came full circle.'

aS'We worked with Kevin Ford at Ford Ellington Design who helped create the most magical design. I knew I wanted pink flower balls but only in my dreams could I imagine hanging flower balls intertwined with crystal elements to create this chandelier. Kevin took a simple brass chandelier and transformed it into something out of a fairytale. It was more beautiful than anything I could have ever imagined. Kevin was more than a florist, he helped us in every detail, everything from the gorgeous table cloths to the light pink chair cushions (a small detail that I absolutely loved) to the lighting at HPCC, he covered it all. His flowers were over the top and each time I look back at the photos I am more and more in love! I told him I wish I could just live under that chandelier forever.'

S'From the Bride  Jon and I met on August 9, 2006 at a well-known Milwaukee pub. It was on a random Wednesday night and we were both there separately with friends. All of a sudden, someone bumped into me and I turned around quickly to just say a meaningless  sorry  and the red head that bumped into me said  Ow! That really hurt.  I smiled and laughed at his sarcasm and we started talking from that moment.'
p6214
aS'We realized how much our lives were aligned starting with the fact that Jon was equally as obsessed with the idea of leaving the Midwest and starting his life in New York City as I was. That evening, I knew I found the man I was going to marry. I told my mom the next morning,  I ll never kiss another man again,  only we hadn t even set our first date yet let alone had a kiss. It was perfect and to this day I have a ring (that I now wear stacked with my wedding band) that has a number nine on it to always keep that day (well, really night) in my mind. The night I met Jon was, hands down, the best night of my life.'

James did all the custom signage for us, my mother made the linens for the Kings table (James wanted patterns and this is where we brought it in) and we had a stunning runner of flowers down the center. We also had a camera station seeing that I was a photographer and wanted something that reflects that.

We decided that it would be incredible to bring our friends and family to this secret find, so there and then we set the wedding date at Kinsterna Hotel, 6 July 2014 4 years to the date after we met.'

Then came the party, yes guests jumped in to the pool and yes we danced until 6.30am with the pictures to prove it! We wish we could do it all over again. We loved every single minute of it.

Ioanna had created my absolute dream wedding, a picture of white white carpet, white flowers, white candles everything pure white, like I had envisaged!!

S'From The Bride From the moment that we started planning our wedding, which was about 8 months before the big day, we knew that we wanted the day to feel as a big garden party, celebrating our love for each other with all our friends and family. Our wedding day was on July 23th, which was exactly 7 years after we first met each other and fell in love while on holiday in France. We planned a summer wedding hoping that the weather would be warm and sunny, and we got lucky because it was a beautiful summer day. We really wanted to get married outside, in nature, because we both are outdoorsy people and enjoy the beauty of what nature has to offer. We wanted the wedding to portray us as individuals and as a couple. Therefore we choose the theme bohemian/vintage adding a lot of small details referring to this; a globe, suitcases, field flowers, dream catchers, feathers, Persian carpets and wooden tables.'
p6406
aS'Having a smaller budget made planning the wedding a little bit more difficult sometimes but it also made inspired us to be creative and think of some very nice ideas. One of them was to ask all of our guests to make and bring a bite to eat. Some were asked to bring a main dish, others to make a dessert. We really liked this idea because we felt that it made all of the guests more involved in the wedding, but also because a very formal dinner just did not suit us at all. It turned out even better than we hoped! There were tables full of beautiful and delicious food, it really looked amazing! It was great to see that everyone put so much effort into making us a wonderful dinner.'

One inner city courtyard was particularly special as the two often meet up for lunch dates. Likely we walked a good 5-6 miles seeing various buildings, art, and capturing this adorable couple s images along the way. I m looking forward to their summer 2014 wedding at the Patrick C.

The entire day was full of personalized details that really showcased the couple s story, love for Chicago and cute surprises along the way.'

We went through nearly three decades of missed connections and visiting the same local haunts throughout our neighboring New Jersey towns. When we met   it was swiftly clear to us both that we soon asked   where have you been all my life? Fate finally brought us together in late summer of 2011 in our current hometown   New York City. I wore a white dress that evening and as soon as I walked through the door of that crowded Manhattan restaurant, Johnny said he knew instantly that I d wear white again   as his bride.'

S'Dan is the most selfless and loving person I have ever met. Together, we share a passion of always helping and caring for others. When planning our special day, it was essential for our wedding to capture the special memories we have created together throughout the years and include the people who have supported and fostered our relationship. It was important to both of us that our wedding was unique and memorable. We knew we wanted to find a venue where we could hold both the ceremony and reception. Dan and I really liked the idea of getting married outdoors with the sun beginning to set at the end of the ceremony. When Dan s brother Adam, the best man, raved about a wedding he had attended at the Dananda House, we had to check it out! We loved the tidy gardens, vast landscape, and the atrium with three walls of ceiling to floor windows that overlooked the forest preserve. We immediately knew that this was the ideal place for us to officially tie the knot!\n\nPart of the theme that we selected had that strong rustic feel, with elements of birch and trees in the invitations, floral arrangements and wedding d cor. My friends tease me that my home looks like a picture out of the Pottery Barn catalog, so I was immediately drawn to the rustic and vintage details of mercury glass and lanterns. The lanterns were used to line the aisle and reused on guests  tables during the reception. Mercury glass candles, globes, vases and votives offered delicate decoration to the cocktail, guest, feasting, dessert, and place card tables. Romantic details came in the rich fabrics of my dress, bouquet ribbon, flower selection, calligraphy, and candle lighting. Skeleton keys adorned place cards to capture a classic vintage feel for guests.\n'

S'Kyle took me to the place where we had our first date, up on a hill top overlooking beautiful Laguna Niguel. The view was breathtaking and brought back memories of the first date we spent together 3 years prior. To my knowledge, I thought we were just going on a walk like we had done the first time, little did I know he had much more planned. When we reached the peek, he got down on one knee and popped the question! The ring was stunning, I couldn t believe it was mine! I remember asking him   this is mine?!  His brother was hiding in the bushes capturing the whole moment! It gets even better  Our families live 6 hours apart, so I was a little bummed knowing I would have to wait a few days to see my mom and sisters. The first chance I got, I called my mom to share in the excitement! Kyle told me that we would be going to dinner with his parents but we needed to stop by his house first. When we arrived, I was surprised by so many of his friends and family all cheering for us when we walked in. I still tear up thinking about it. As I walk further in the house admiring the beautiful decorations that his mom and my sister-in-law, Whitney put together, I hear my dad s voice! I turn around and see my dad, mom and sister standing there. I immediately dropped to the ground. I was so overwhelmed with joy, something I have never in my life felt. Before we got engaged Kyle knew the only 2 things I really wanted was pictures of the moment and to share in the excitement afterward with family and friends. He definitely went above and beyond what I could of ever imagined!'

aS'From the beautiful Bride Kyle and I met when I was just about to begin my sophmore year of high school, and he was about to begin his junior year. We met at summer camp, Hume Lake Christian camp, to be specific! I remember being out in the middle of the lake with some girls in my cabin when we met. I even remember the exact shirt he was wearing. Haha. After camp, we found each other on MySpace and begin building a friendship from that point on. He quickly became my best friend. I was so impressed by how easy he was to talk to, how much he made me laugh, and how absolutely different he was to me than any other guy I had met. Living 6 hours away at the time, we would stay up late nights skyping and talking on the phone. We could talk for hours and hours. It was hard to ever say goodbye or goodnight. After a couple years of building a solid friendship, we always knew we had feelings for each other but didn t know how the long distance would work. We decided in February of 2011 to give it a shot and  officially  date. We remained long distance for about 10 months, taking multiple trips back and forth to see each other. In January of 2012, Kyle moved up by me to join the local Fire Academy. He ended up living with my brother and his wife for about 6 months during academy, then got his own place. He stayed up here ever since! The rest is history. I married my best friend, my complete answer to prayer.'

S'When Justin popped the question, we had been together for 6 years and both new we wanted to spend forever with each other, so of course I couldn t respond  YES  quick enough. Justin proposed in a fairytale-like way. Anyone who knows me, knows that I absolutely LOVE the holiday season. It truly is my favorite time of year, so when Justin popped the question on New Years Eve 2011, it made perfect sense. Going to plays is one of our things we love to do together, so weeks in advance he had planned a date night for us to go see Cinderella at a local theater and grab dinner at one of our favorite restaurants in the city. On the night of New Years Eve, 2011, we walked out of the play and it was snowing these huge, puffy, white gorgeous snowflakes, the sight was so beautiful it made me tear up   little did I know what was coming that would make me really cry. He asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the park that is across from the theater. The park had all the trees light up, dripping in gorgeous, sparkly white lights. We walked hand-in-hand, soaking up the beauty of the snow, loving that moment with each other . And then Justin got down on one knee and asked me to spend the rest of my life with him. It was truly a magical moment.'

We both knew something was there between us, but we didn t start dating until years later. Due to various life events (mainly in part to the fact that we were both so young and at very different stages of our lives at that point in time), Justin and I went our separate ways and had little to no contact for 3 years. Then one day, I got a random text message from him. As he would say, he couldn t stop thinking about me and just decided to reach out to see if I would respond. Obviously fate has different intentions for us than we had expected. We began dating and the rest is history!'

Both of us being transplants to Chicago, we decided we wanted a wedding that embraced the city in which we met and fell in love. We chose a modern black, white, and yellow theme that captured the Chicago skyline and had our ceremony and reception on the 66th and 67th floors of the Metropolitan Club in the City s most iconic building, The Willis Tower. The bridal gown was a fit and flare style with a silk structured bodice adorned with crystals and flowing skirt and train that fluttered with soft flowers that matched my all white peonies bouquet. The bridesmaids wore modern black cocktail dresses accented crystal details and crystal jewelry from the Left Bank while carrying bouquets of yellow tulips, roses and ranunculus.'

S'Now, to pick the date The most important part of our planning was to find an amazing photographer. We were blown away by Blenda Montoro Miller and her artistic eye for capturing love. Before we even contacted her we knew we would just pick our date around her availability. When she said June 28th was available that is when we set our date for our elopement! Our vision for our secret wedding was a romantic island elopement where elegance meets simplicity. I found my dress through the J Crew wedding collection. I had two pairs of shoes, a flowery sandal for walking on the beach and for my something blue, a fun pair of blue heels from Badgley Mishka. I had  borrowed  my moms pearl necklace and Louis gave me pearl earrings as a wedding gift. Kristy at The LAB Salon did a beautiful job with my hair and makeup. She hit it spot on with a beachy romantic hairstyle and a statement peony on the side. The talented designers at Martin Roberts Design created the beautiful soft romantic peony bouquet. Louis dressed the part looking sharp in his blue suit with custom made cuff links reading  lucky me . Even though our vision for our wedding was simple and laid back, these small details made it really special to us.'
p7075
aS'Keeping with the theme of just enjoying our day and going with the flow, we weren t exactly sure where we were going to have the ceremony. At the time of our wedding we met our photographer Blenda and officiant, Kelvin Ho in front of the resort we were staying at. We were thinking of having the ceremony right there on Shipwrecks beach but with the advice of Blenda and Kelvin we decided to take a little walk up to the cliffs above the beach where we found the most dramatic, intimate and perfect spot to say  I DO!  The skies were blue, the wind was cleansing and the love between us was undeniable. Our officiant Kelvin spoke such beautiful, heartfelt words during the ceremony rituals. We could not have asked for a better officiant to share this special moment with as we start our lives together as husband and wife. It took our breath away. After the ceremony Blenda, her husband Raymond, Louis and I went to a second location at The Kilohana Plantation to celebrate with champagne and take some fun photos. We couldn t have asked for a better day and we have the most amazing photographs that captured these moments to share with family and friends.\n'

From the first time I met him, I was drawn to his outgoing personality and the ability he had to make everything more fun. He quickly became one of my best friends at Mizzou and after 2 years of being good friends (and some big realizations and a near death experience on a plane) we finally started dating. Once we started dating, it didn t take us too long to realize we wanted to spend our lives together. Joel makes me laugh more than anyone, he entertains me to no end, and he is incredibly thoughtful, gentle, and caring of every person in his life. He also has this ability to befriend literally every type of person.'

I d like to say that was the beginning of our beautiful relationship, but it took some gentle cajoling from Scott and polite persistence from Hartley to get me on a real date. But one real date later, I was head-over-heels for my guy.'

aS'For our day, we knew we wanted it to be simple, we wanted it to be  us  and we wanted it to be a big ol  love fest. Anything else would be icing on the cake. The wedding turned out to be more incredible than either of us ever imagined it could be. Our fabulous coordinator, Zohe Felici (Felici Events,) made that day so very stress-free. We showed up to the venue and were wowed by all the work she and her staff had done. She took all of our simple ideas and made them beautiful. All of our vendors added something spectacular to the event: our photographer, Anna Costa, was marvelous. She got spectacular photos and didn t keep us from our guests for any longer than necessary. Our caterers, (Island View Catering,) kept the crowd happy and kept us better fed than any bride and groom in the history of weddings. Our DJ, (Music by Bonnie,) had put up with all our odd requests and handled the mood of the party from pre-ceremony through reception.'

S'From Megan Thiele Studios On a romantic Wednesday in early June, in historic Forest Park in St. Louis, Olivia and Baris were married in front of 13 of their closest friends and family.  They met at Washington University, and decided to take a non-traditional yet glamorous approach to their wedding.  Olivia sparkled in a gold Badgley Mischka gown, holding a bouquet of white peonies, while walking the path to meet her groom right before the ceremony; you could see her classic red lips smiling a mile away. They said their vows in a short ceremony next to a reflecting pool in front of the Jewel Box, a 75-year-old Art Deco greenhouse, accompanied by a few sprinkles, a couple of ducks, and a bunny in the shrubs nearby.  Once their union was made official, all 15 persons had a photo taken to commemorate the event, they shared a toast, and the bride and groom set off to take photos with their two dogs, Argon and Shirley.  The day ended with a warm summer shower and radiant smiles; a lovely story to share with generations to come.'

S'From The Bride  Andrew and I met our freshman year at the University of Arizona and as they say, the rest is history. The military brought us to the East Coast but we knew we wanted to be married in our home state of California and near my hometown in the Bay Area. When we picked the Legion of Honor as our wedding location, we were warned that August is the foggiest month of the year, earning the nickname of  Fogust . Not only is the Legion of Honor an architectural masterpiece, the property has stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the perfect backdrop to a wedding ceremony. Fogust lived up to its name and there was no bridge to be seen during our wedding ceremony but the photos are breathtaking even without the iconic bridge.'
p7302
aS'Andrew picked out a charcoal gray suit that looked great on all the groomsmen. The boys all wore a purple madras tie to match Andrew s bow tie. The charcoal gray and purple looked great together! Following the theme, the bridesmaids wore Jenny Yoo Aidan charcoal dresses. All five bridesmaids picked a different way to wear the dress and had amazing pink and purple bouquets in their hands. Katherine of Cherries made my dream floral arrangements a reality. We met two times while I was in town and showed her my dress, shoes, swatches of the bridesmaid s dresses and she went to work with my pink and purple flower request. She has great vision, and we were blown away by her abilities to pull everything together.'

S'From the Bride.. It was a typical late night after work on 2010 when I first met Zoo, now my husband. I was working as a chef at London West Hollywood hotel, and after cooking for exhausting 10 hours, my co-worker and I could not help the late night munchies. Usually, this late night munchies are evil, but I say this one was the opposite since it led me to meet my husband, who was a good friend of my co-worker and was fighting the munchies just like us! My co-worker called Zoo out and we ended up having drinks/snacks together. In fact, nothing happened that night. I only remember the meal was just good and Zoo was wearing a red beanie, which I was like,  what the  . No one, even my co-worker, this night would be the beginning of everything. We didn t know why, but we found we hung out each other more often since that accidental, but destined night.'

S'Nicole wanted our venue to be outdoors and I wanted it to be modern, but we did not know how to make our vision a reality. The Skirball Cultural Center, like everything else our coordinator recommended, managed to represent both of our visions perfectly. Architecturally modern with an outdoor space complete with a reflection pond and the Santa Monica mountains in the background, we could not have imagined a better venue. Blossom Floral (recommended by Hustle and Bustle), also managed to find the ideal style that fit both Nicole s and my tastes. I wanted a more organic feel to the flowers, and Nicole wanted a more structural arrangement. Blossom Floral created a Chuppah that was at once free flowing and still structured. She met with us numerous times to ensure we would be happy with the design, and did not leave any detail to chance. Because of the art deco theme we were aiming for, we agreed that we wanted a cake that reflected that era. Lark Cake Shop not only had the most delicious cakes we sampled, but also created a beautiful cake for us right out of the 1920s. H&B also recommended we use Theresa Huang for our make-up and hair. We could not have been happier. Theresa Huang understood the art deco look I was going for, and had enough stylists to help Nicole, me, and our bridesmaids all get ready in time for the big day. In fact, all of our bridesmaids ended up getting their make-up and hair done, despite originally planning on only doing their hair. Finally, we worked with the lovely and talented Emily Schwartz to design our save the dates (and eventually our invitations, etc.), and she perfectly encapsulated our art deco style.'

It hung off of a vintage bow pin so that I was able to wear it on her dress. In addition, our friend, Vonnett, loaned her own grandmother s diamond and sapphire wedding ring for my something borrowed, something old and something blue.'
p7439
aS'In return, I sent Kyle a gift of  something old, new, borrowed and blue  in a small leather chest. The something old was represented by notes scratched on binder paper that were saved from high school and attached to a bottle of Kyle s favorite Balvenie scotch, aged 17 years, the same amount of time we had known each other. The something new was a tie clip stamped with the coordinates of the wedding venue in Belize, which was also secretly engraved on the inside of his wedding band. The something borrowed was probably the most special to Kyle. Being that both of our grandfathers and fathers served in the military, I  borrowed  each of their dog tags. The something blue was a blue silk-screened tie with Kyle s favorite B-17 bomber printed on it.'

Also, the proceeds went to Doctors Without Borders and nuclear cleanup. For the ladies, I thanked them for coming to help me  tie the knot  with sterling silver love knot earrings from Cate & Chloe.'

Both trips were a very different experience to the side of Ibiza we have since come to love, but the seed was planted nonetheless! We have since re-visited the island as a couple and with friends and can t deny there is something special about the place. There are frequent moments when you look out at the crystal clear waters, beautiful sunset or when you are chatting with friends over a BBQ that you think that this is what you have waited all year for   times like these, in a place like this. That feeling is something that we wanted to share with our closest friends and family on our wedding day and to enjoy the moment and location that we love so much together.'

We started off as good friends and over the course of a year started to develop less platonic feelings for one another. From the beginning of the relationship, I think both of us sensed that this was a relationship for the long haul. About two and a half years of dating, we both grabbed a drink after a friend s holiday party and started joking about what our wedding would look like. After a few drinks, we both looked at each other and couldn t find any reason to not make it happen right away.'
p7563
aS'Eguiar was born and raised in the Canary Islands of Spain, and my parents were Indian immigrants that came over to the US in their 20s. We wanted to honor both our Spanish and Indian heritages, recognizing that at times they can be diametrically in opposition of one another. Spain seemed like a perfect midpoint for my relatives in India and friends in the US, while making it easier for his friends and family to travel. We settled on Marbella, Spain for its proximity to the beach, mountains and the oft-visited sites of Sevilla, Granada and Morocco.'

S'From Soir e Weddings & Events  Aileen and Kevin had a specific vision in mind when we first met with them. Aileen envisioned a classic elegance and vintage romance. '
p7610
aS'Aileen loved picking out the flowers. A former Cali girl, she admired all the natural floral scents that graced her California home. She very much wanted to bring some of those flowers and scents into her wedding day. We knew that flowering Jasmine Vine must be represented in her bouquet   a little piece of Cali and a piece of her heart. Aileen s Irish roots also played a big role as well. We wanted to honor her heritage and also her grandmother who couldn t come to the US for the wedding; what better way than with gorgeous monochromatic centerpieces made up of lush green Bells of Ireland? They were hosted in a metallic trumpet vase and served as the lovely elevated floral arrangements that complimented the height of the tent.'

aS'From The Bride  Despite sharing our junior high school years living less than one mile apart in Colorado Springs, we didn t meet until college, at the University of Colorado in Boulder. When fate decided we were ready, we met and became fast friends, sharing many hours onstage performing in various Colorado-based West African bands; most notably the University of Colorado s West African Highlife Ensemble. I was an amazing dancer, and Kevin did his best to figure out the tricky trumpet parts.'
p7612
aS'Romance wasn t in the cards until after college, when we both ended up in Chicago. I was busy getting my Ph.D. in clinical neuropsychology and Kevin messing with pop-psychology as a Madmen-in-training at Leo Burnett. During our late 20s our deep friendship evolved into something more, and the  L  word (i.e.  Love ) was in play just before I embarked on my California adventure to complete my internship and post-doctoral studies at the West LA VA Hospital and UCLA, respectively. Just four short (i.e. LONG!) years later (FOUR YEARS OF LONG DISTANCE!) we reunited back in Chicago, and were soon to be engaged!'

We had themes for every part of the evening to showcase our eclectic taste in music. For example, cocktail hour hailed  Yacht Rock  music from Hall and Oates to The Doobie Brothers. Dinner was filled with 90 s R&B love songs from Babyface, New Edition, and K-Ci & JoJo, and dancing was Top 40 music with Lil Jon, Pink, and Flo Rida bouncing off the walls all night long.

Daniel played  Baby John  and I was a dancer and  girlfriend of Diesel  in the  Jet  gang. We became great friends through long rehearsals and the run of the show. We started dating and realized very quickly we were good for each other s soul. We dated for seven years which took us from our hometown Milwaukee, WI to Chicago, IL. Along the way we  grew up  together, became best friends, held each other s hand through really hard times, and supported each other through our greatest successes. Being struggling artists is not easy, but Daniel is the person you want at the finish line when you have nothing left and I m the person encouraging you along the way. '

Our long-distance relationship continued for over two years until Nelson made the move to Chicago. It was in the Windy City that we began to build our life together, experiencing as much of it as we possibly could, and easily making Chicago our home. Three years later Nelson picked up the engagement ring he had designed on his way home from work and immediately proposed on Oak Street Beach. From there the wedding planning began!'

S'From Closer To Love Photography  Tamara and Tim (also referred to as TimTam) met through a dating website and conversed for a year and half before officially meeting in person in Australia. Tamara is from Sydney, Australia and Tim from San Francisco, which often times made their courtship difficult due to distance, but they kept in touch via phone calls and Skype. They looked forward to reuniting time and time again in Australia and TimTam made the most of every opportunity whenever they were on the same side of the planet. Ultimately, their attraction for each other s values, honesty and off-beat humor won both of them over and Tim would soon ask Tamara to be his beautiful bride! Having only 2 1/2 months to pull their entire Wedding Day off due to immigration terms, TimTam succeeded at planning and creating an inviting, intimate and homey Wedding at the Rengstorff House in Mountain View, California! Surrounded by dear ones from near and afar, their Wedding Day was filled with so much joy, laughter and endless love from all that were present.'

Having been through college and graduate school together, we had developed a close-knit group of friends, and we had been a part of each other s families for years. We set out to plan a cheerful, community-oriented wedding that celebrated not only our love and commitment, but moreso all of the relationships we have with friends and family that shape our lives.'
p8090
aS'First of all, we wanted our bridal party to be integral to the wedding. As far as the look, each of the  bridesbabes  found her own dress (one a year ahead and another two days before), and the eight best men picked their own vests. To keep things light-hearted, our friends danced down the aisle to  Dog Days Are Over  by Florence and the Machine. We think our friends are pretty awesome, so we wanted guests to be able to get to know them better. We asked our friends to be part of our wedding via a video we made while backpacking in Europe. We then asked each of our friends to make a video response expressing what they bring to the wedding PARTY, memories, or wishes, which we then played during cocktail hour. We also asked each pair to brainstorm something the two of them have in common, which contributed to their introductions at the reception.'

S'My husband Silas and I wanted a day that really captured the blending of our cultures  I am of Asian Indian ethnicity, however, was born and raised in the South (Georgia). Silas was born in the midwest and raised in Chicago so we wanted a venue full of Chicago culture and history. Since we fell in love and met in Chicago, we wanted our wedding set in the city. Union Station Train station was the perfect fit in downtown Chicago. I wore an Enzoani gown with a traditional Indian tikka pinned in my hair and draped on my forehead. My hands and feet were also adorned with traditional Indian bridal mehndi. We chose purples and blues as our colors with the hint of a peacock theme. We had our first look at the Conrad Hotel, downtown Chicago, on an open balcony which overlooked the city. We then took pictures on the bridge that Silas proposed to me on, Kinsey bridge, with our dog Oliver. Silas and I were married under a modern day Indian mandap with a wall of cascading orchids. We had a traditional american processional for the wedding party and my Dad and I, and walked down an aisle lined with floating orchids. We then were married by a Hindu priestess with a 30 minute ceremony. The string quartet during our ceremony were fantastic, playing more traditional American processional music (such as Cannon D for the daddy/daughter walk), and Elvis,  Can t help falling in love  for the bridal party. The favorite part of the ceremony for both of us when when the quartet played Bittersweet Symphony just as we were pronounced husband and wife and for our recessional. During the recessional, guests threw rose petals on us as I threw rice over my shoulder for my mom to catch (Called Vidaai in the traditional Indian ceremony-signifies the bride leaving the house). Next, our cocktail hour had special touches including food that incorporated all of our cultures (i.e. fried chicken quesadillas and fried green tomatoes, tandoori chicken lollipops). Our reception table decor consisted of vases of alternating sizes with floating orchids with the smaller tables having tall branched trees. My dad and I did a surprise Georgia medley first dance, starting with the fox trot to Georgia on my mind, then breaking into a rap dance after a record scratch (to Welcome to Atlanta, Ludacris) and line dancing (Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee, Alan Jackson-I changed into FRYE cowboy boots for the dance). My husband also surpised me with a traditional Indian bhangra dance that he had practiced the week before the wedding. The night ended with a great DJ mix, a huge dance party and even an after party at on of our favorite local bar. All in all, it was a day full of surprises, laughter and most of all, love as we celebrated the blending of many distinctly different, but equally important cultures.\n'

S'From the beautiful Bride  When Keith and I started planning our wedding we both quickly agreed we wanted to do something that was small and intimate, with close family and friends, but also\n something that was fun and reflected our personalities. When we found Farmstead we agreed that it featured all of the elements we wanted, rustic charm mixed with fun quirks such as a giant moose head hung above the bar. We also knew that Napa Valley would be a great destination for our guests who would be traveling from near and far. Once the venue was set the rest of the decisions fell easily into place, which left me plenty of time to focus on all of the DIYs I had envisioned. My favorites were   The chalkboard signs I made for the bridesmaids to write down how we met, the curtain the florist and I made together for the backdrop to the ceremony and the the cigar box I made for Keith as his wedding day gift.'

'
p8378
aS'Glasses of cava with lavender sprigs welcomed the guests pre-ceremony, so they could immediately get into the party spirit. Large metal tubs overflowed with Old Speckled Hen, the first drink Dan and I ever shared together. At cocktail hour, while the guitarists continued playing, we served signature beverages named after where we met (The Village Idiot, made of bourbon and cherry bitters for Dan) and where we got engaged (Hollywood Forever, a mezcal and citrus concoction for me).'
p8379
aS'To keep things casual and intimate, we knew we wanted to do family-style sharing for dinner. The meal started with a plated salad of arugula with stone fruit and burrata. Then came salmon with lentils, hanger steak with a shallot wine sauce, chili-flake broccolini and the most amazing  smashed  potatoes ever. Passed appetizers at cocktail hour included risotto balls, goat cheese and fig tarts and ahi tuna tacos. The bread was from one of our favorite restaurants, Tavern. And we meticulously tasted and chose the Spanish wines together.'
p8380
aS'When we finally had to turn the music off, the guests who still had energy moved to an after-party in a room overlooking the pool. Guests lounged together on floor pillows and poufs, enjoying midnight snacks: french fries, grilled cheese sandwiches and Mexican wedding cookies. I surprised Dan with a platter of his favorite: gourmet pigs in a blanket   which I had once sworn I would never, ever serve at my wedding!\n'

As life sometimes flows  we both went our separate ways in relationships and I moved on from my job at the winery but we always stayed in touch, wishing each other happy birthday, and sending random texts here and there. Chris had always held a special place with me and he crept into my thoughts more than I would like to admit during that time apart.'

And luckily for a UPS delivery gone wrong  after a roundabout conversation  I asked Chris to meet me for a drink, Yes I asked Chris out. We met at our friends beer bar Tap25, neither one of us sure of whether or not it was a date, but after a beer or two it became clear that we were going to be more than just friends. We ended up going to dinner, then he took me back to the winery and let me sample his wine. It was an amazing first date!'

When Greg graduated, he turned down all of his full time employment opportunities for a three-month internship that allowed him to move to Chicago too. Two and half years later, he surprised me by taking me on a very special tour of the city. We stopped at all the places that were special to us, took polaroids, drank champagne, and eventually ended up on the rooftop of our apartment building where he proposed.'

S'From The Bride..Daniel and I didn t have a specific  first time we met.  In fact, I don t think either one of us can remember first meeting each other. We ve just always been in each other s lives.\n Daniel s younger sister, Toni was my childhood best friend. Most of my memories of summer vacations, sleep overs, birthday parties, and milestone events include her. And because Toni and Daniel lived 4 blocks away from me, he was always around. In high school, my brother and Daniel also became inseparable, making my existing crush even more intense. Though it was each other s siblings that brought us together, we often found ourselves finding reasons to spend time alone with each other.We bonded over music, books, and movies that were so delightfully dark and intriguing to our burgeoning adolescent tastes. I used every opportunity to seize private moments with Daniel and he searched for the chance to impress me. I remember being at their house for a sleepover with Toni when Daniel walked in her room where we were buried in Seventeen magazines. He interrupted our gossip session for some inane reason that, at the time, seemed legitimate. With an exaggerated cough, Toni pointed out Daniel s excessive use of cologne at 9 PM on a Saturday at home. Of course, to me, his interruption was the best kind of magical.'
p8567
aS'On the day of Toni s wedding, I was shaking with nerves, for so many reasons: my best friend was getting married (try not to ugly cry), I was the MOH (try not to fall on your face), and I was going to see Daniel after more than three years (try not to look stupid, effected, nervous, jealous, etc.) He was an usher at the wedding and was standing in the foyer of the church when the bridesmaids and I walked in to take our places for the ceremony. I looked at him just as he turned to look at me and I silently mouthed,  I m so nervous.  It might seem an odd thing to say to an ex that you haven t seen in so long, but it was a testament to our relationship beyond romance or complications. With comforting familiarity, he replied,  You look beautiful; you ll be great.  That was the moment we first met; at a wedding where we both brought dates, 16 years after I became his sister s best friend, and 3 years after our first kiss.'

Post high school we both left Michigan, Leland to Montana and myself, well  several places. A few years ago we each came back to our old hometown and to our old hole in the wall bar where we finally crossed paths. We dated for a few months before we went to his family s summer home in Charlevoix. There in Charlevoix watching the sunset on Lake Michigan was the first time he said  I love you . Six months later we moved to Pennsylvania and two years later he proposed.'

Our friends would describe us as fun-loving and laid-back, and we wanted our wedding to reflect our personalities.'

aS'Our first plan was to have everyone celebrate at the camp where we met, but the property is not set-up for weddings. On to Plan B; Chicago!, which in the end was actually Plan A and a lot easier for all our guests. We love our city and wanted to share the best of the best with our guests. I m an event planner professionally, so I am constantly challenged to create unforgettable experiences and knew this was a big one for me. There was really only one venue that we considered   the Chicago Cultural Center (formerly the public library). A destination in itself for tourists, we knew this was a knock-your-socks-off reception setting for our visiting guests.'

S'From Deonna Caruso Photography  On July 13, 2013, Dana Parkhill and Frank Miller were married at the beautiful Armour House in Lake Forest. What a perfect day for an outdoor wedding and when I say perfect, it was truly that! The day could not have been better for the two of them. Dana and Frank met each other a couple of years ago through a mutual friend. When they first met their friend said  Mr. Nice Guy meet Mrs. Nice Girl.   When you meet both of them you realize that pretty much sums it up. After they met each other they dated and endured a long-distance relationship for awhile. Frank was finishing up undergrad at Wake Forest in North Carolina and Dana was finishing graduate school in Bloomington, Indiana. They spent summers together and saw each other when they could. When Frank graduated in 2012, he came to Bloomington and got a job. They were so grateful to finally be in the same town! Frank proposed to Dana at a local winery in Bloomington in October of 2012 and the rest is history. When you see the two of them together you can see how much love and respect they have for each other and it was such an honor to capture their gorgeous wedding day!'

We envisioned our wedding as casually elegant, and we wanted the rock-and-roll moments to be just as memorable as the romantic moments. With the help of our families, our friends, our wonderful vendors, our coordinator Courtney Cargile, and the blank palate of Cornerstone Gardens, we were able to achieve the wedding of our dreams.'

After several trips to department stores and designer boutiques between Los Angeles and San Francisco, I happened on a San Francisco boutique, And Something Blue, which carried Trish Lee, a local designer. As soon as I put on the Trish Lee dress, I knew it was right! I paired it with my grandmother s antique diamond and jade hanging earrings for a pop of color ( something old ) and I had my mother s wedding veil recut for the perfect accompaniment ( something borrowed ).

S'From The Bride After the surprise of the proposal (although we had been dating for 11 years since we met in sophomore English class) the reality set in that we had to plan a wedding. First on the agenda was a date and a venue. Surprisingly, those came easily. We knew we weren t country club, hotel ballroom, yacht club, or beach types and we weren t rugged outdoors types. That certainly limited our options in Los Angeles. But, as soon as we discovered the Smog Shoppe venue with its blank canvas, urban vibe we were sold. Since we live out of town in San Francisco, we knew we needed a wedding planner to coordinate. I found Nira DeLuna of Amber Events and right away I knew her laid back, confident energy was a perfect fit. Nira kept us on track from day one!'

p8810
aS'Beyond a few inspiration photos found online, we really needed some help crafting an overall look for the space. I liked the idea of having a lot of gold candlesticks on the table and small vessels and arrangements and a seasonal palate. When we met with Meg and Annie from The Little Branch, they did a really great job to guiding me toward look we really loved. This began a very organic process of building our design concept; one layer at a time. Together we chose saturated gilded tones of burgundy, mustard, brass, gold, rose gold, dusty rose and corals. The big blooms and whimsical flowers were wrapped in gold for my bouquet. The groom s bout was textures with mustard and burgundy tones.'
p8811
aS'They also designed our birch chuppah with simple branchy asymmetrical florals in Boho style to set against the backdrop of the succulent wall at the Smog Shoppe. The gold mercury urns, vintage brass vases and gold and glittered bud vases were filled with arrangements of flowers they used including: Ranunculus, Anemones, Peonies, Garden Roses, Butterfly Hydrangea, Spanish Moss, and Gold Painted Succulents. I had collected large vintage varied gold frames that they suspended on the wall behind the dessert table with floral arrangements within the frame. One hundred varied gold mercury votives were on the reception tables and throughout the room. Various sized glass vases were filled with brass candlesticks and candles.'

It was a warm 72 degrees with a lake breeze, and after nearly eight years together, we were getting married. From the ceremony to the reception, the day moved beautifully. The feel of our Museum of Contemporary Art party was fresh and modern, with clean lines and all white tables. We aimed for timeless elegance, yet kept the celebration chic and current. Nothing says spring like white tulips, peonies, and ranunculus (bride s favorite flower), which were spread throughout the main gallery floor. To make the grand gallery space feel more intimate, yet still dramatic, we opted for two long king s tables to seat our 175 guests. Perhaps our favorite memory of the day was dancing our first dance, as the Bubbly Creek Band played. Our love for Bluegrass music is something we enjoy as a couple, and their performance was fresh and fun a great way to transition into the party! We couldn t have asked for more love and energy from our guests!\n'

S'I have been doing weddings in Italy since 2009, and I only work with foreign couples that are in love with Tuscany and want to tie the knot here. Couples always ask me how they can incorporate the Italian style into their wedding and mix it in with their own cultures. With that in mind, I d always wanted to create something that shows the colours, tastes, and glamour of a wedding in a  pure Italian style ; so when I met the amazing Adrian Wood, we didn t think twice about planning a photo shooting in Tuscany.'

Years later we reconnected through Facebook and after 17 years we finally met again when Christiana asked me to be her wedding photographer.

We were young at the time so, as romantic and sweet as the date was, it didn t really go beyond sharing an ice- cream and a stroll through the park! Two years later our eyes met again at the mixed girls and boys secondary school. It was then we went on our second and more successful date and spent the most amazing 4 years together. We were high school sweethearts who got to see each other everyday and share some special moments together.'

Our officiant was from my church in the suburbs where I have gone my whole life so even though we were not in that particular space it was nice to have a piece of it there with us that day. We absolutely loved all that the Ivy Room had to offer and tried to compliment it with soft pinks (using peonies my favorite flower) and champagne colors and focus on candles and lighting. We wanted to make sure every detail was perfect, yet at the same time did not want to get carried away with too many little things and lose sight of what we were there for. This was especially evident in our guestbook which was done by our photographer to be a book of all of our engagement photos as the pages and our guests could write messages on top of the photos. We really loved how she wanted to capture and show our personality as a couple in both our engagement and wedding photos for our love for each other, Chicago, and our friends and family. '

Soon after they began talking, Oren pulled at Meredith s heart strings when instead of sending a typical gift such as flowers, Oren sent a gift basket to Meredith s family s two Portuguese Water Dogs. He knew the way to her heart. A month after their phone conversations began, Meredith and Oren finally met in LA, and have been inseparable ever since.

What ensued was months upon months of collaborative brain-storming, selecting perfectly-hued blooms, drooling over textured linens, and meticulously arranging floor plans. Katherine, her mother and I spent over 15 months together planning this special day. Our business relationship quickly grew into a warm friendship, which I will forever cherish.'

aS'The most important design aspects for this wedding were the little, but impactful and adorable details. French baguettes with hand calligraphed place cards tied in twine at each place setting. Custom display flags for all of the gourmet cheeses and desserts. Frames with calligraphed menu details at each food station. Bride and groom s chair signage adorned with draping greenery and lush blooms. A vintage globe for guests to sign, rather than the traditional book. A local Lebanese pastries and sweets station to reflect the bride s heritage. Multi-layered and textured draping ribbons on the bride s bouquet handle. A coral flip flop station for guests to get comfortable and dance in  The details were endless and the effect clearly showed. It really is all about making the guest experience truly remarkable!'

aS'Picking the venue was a bit challenging as I was really set on having the reception outdoors. The outdoor feel more accurately reflected our vision than any of the indoor venues in Grand Rapids. We decided on a venue that came full circle for us   we met at Blythefield Country Club four years earlier and thought it would be the perfect place for our reception as well.

Just before the wedding began, Jed and I met at the historic Koloa sugar mill for our first look. The words It all started here are painted under a rainbow on an old silo, so it only seemed appropriate that we incorporate it into the beginning of our new lives together. Our amazing photographer, Blenda Montoro Miller of Blenda Montoro Photography, was so easy to work with. She had taken our engagement photos, so the wedding day was easy because we already felt so comfortable with her behind the lens. Always prepared, Blenda brought several props such as the hand painted Just Married sign, as well as a ladder so that she could get the perfect angles for my tall groom.'

S'From The Bride While Kyle and I live in Dallas, we always knew we d get married in the city that holds our hearts   Saint Louis. It s where we both grew up. It s where we met (eight years ago as seniors in high school!). And it s a city with the most admirable spirit. Not to mention, it s the city that s home to our most beloved family and friends. To me, Saint Louis embodies everything I hoped our wedding would be. Classic, but not too serious. Vibrant. And thoughtful. Maybe even timeless and unforgettable. But mostly, overflowing with joy. Before we could dive into the details (my most favorite part), we had to find the reception venue that would set the tone. It didn t take long to realize that Forest Park Visitor Center was the obvious choice. As the hub of one of the greatest civic treasures of Saint Louis, it did everything it needed to. It was authentic, beautifully constructed, and filled with natural light   the most sincere palette.'

aS'The rest of our wedding planning followed naturally. We wanted the day to be beautiful and timeless, but also to really focus on the things that Lauren and I cared about most: friends and family, drinks and dancing, and amazing food! We were planning from afar so we made most of our decisions during a weeklong, whirlwind wedding trip during the winter holidays (and had lots of help from some amazing people). Our reception venue was a beautiful private home and garden, just minutes from the church, that had exactly the comfortable elegance we were looking for. Since we both seriously lack any artistic talent, we found other ways to add our own personal touches to the reception: a shuck-to order oyster bar (hands down my favorite food), personalized appetizers (fish n  chips and crabcakes, reminiscent of our many trips to Barbara s Fishtrap in nearby Half Moon Bay), a string quartet to play during the cocktail hours (one of our first dates was at the San Francisco Symphony), and his and her signature cocktails (Lauren s classic French 75 and my dirty martini). Our flowers were done by a florist Lauren s family has known since she was a child. We met with them six weeks before the wedding, described our color scheme and gave them free-reign with the design and were amazed at how perfectly everything turned out.'

Five days later he returned to Ireland, and I would not see him again for the following six months. During this time I threw myself into wedding planning and (more importantly) visa paperwork. We didn t set out planning our wedding with a particular theme in mind. We knew we wanted something  classic and elegant,  but as far as colors and styles went, we were pretty much open to anything. What was most important to Shane and I, was that our wedding be an unforgettable party, with good food, drinks, music and dancing all taking top priority.

Neither of us were looking to start a relationship at the time, least of all with someone who lived four thousand miles away  and yet somehow that is exactly what ended up happening. Shane had just finished college at the time, and, never having gone more than a couple hundred miles from his hometown in Ireland, was looking to do some traveling before starting work. He expressed some interest in visiting the states, and asked me if I had any recommendations on where to go. I of course told him he had to see Chicago, and jokingly mentioned that I would put him up in my college dorm room if he ever decided to visit, never in a million years thinking that anything would ever come of it.

S'From the Bride  Our story has so many one-in-a-million unexpected moments, and I knew our wedding wouldn t be much different. Peter and I met at a pub in Dallas (where he just so happened to be transferred for work temporarily) where we had both never visited, on a Thursday night, while I was celebrating my acceptance to grad school. Even though I was moving soon, we decided to give a relationship a try. After over two years of having a long-distance relationship, Peter decided to propose during one of my summer visits to see him. He completely went over the top, and got down on one knee in a hot air balloon while we were viewing the Sierra Nevada Mountains. With my new amazing custom ring (a French cut black diamond with a pave setting) to set the stage, I began to dream about the wedding.'
p9681
aS'I come from a long lineage of creative  makers  that fabricate with their hands through many mediums. I m formally trained as an architect, and I ve had an affinity for small delightful details for as long as I can remember, and I knew I wanted to have my hands in the whole design process. The foundation of my design ideas for the wedding began with my dress. After trying on a multitude of dresses that just didn t feel like  me  I finally found the one, but it still needed a little something else. I love the avant-garde feel of monotone color palettes with textured materials, and decided I wanted my dress dyed ombre gray. Thus our colors became gray and white, with pops of green. I wanted the materials we used, and where we were to be in their  essence  and show organic wear and patina.'

S'Fold a soft color palette into an already gorgeous backdrop and it never fails to evoke all out romance. Delbarr Moradi Photography also helps. Her images are the kind we want to hang on our walls and pin feverishly to our wedding boards. We first met this duo here and now their story is coming full circle. With styling by Amanda O Shannessy Creative, florals by Huckleberry Karen Designs, and a gorgeous dessert spread by Dolce Cakes, this gallery is sure to be one of your faves.'
p9722
aS'From Amanda O Creative When I initially met with Naomi and Vic to discuss their vision for their wedding they told me the story of how they ended up dating. They were in college and had been friends for a while but secretly they both had feelings for each other. One night they both had a dream that they kissed! Eventually they told each other about these dreams and of course   started dating soon after! Their dreams, which brought them together, played such an important part of their love story that we knew we had to incorporate them into their wedding design in some way. To help create a romantic, dream-like setting we decided on lots of soft, sunset inspired colors with washes of watercolor to give the design an ethereal vibe. Romantic florals and flowing chiffon framed Naomi and Vic as they exchanged vows overlooking the golden hills of Northern California. Guests found their way to their seats by picking up escort cards which were calligraphed by Naomi s talented bridesmaid. Pieces of sea glass, which brought in a beautiful mint color, served as weights for each card and were also used as sign holders. We incorporated the same mint color and lush florals into their dessert display where a watercolor sign that read  a dream is a wish your heart makes  was framed by greenery and soft pastel flowers. The same lush, romantic pastel flowers were found in the centerpieces and bouquets where pops of gold added just a little bit of sparkle and glam to the outdoor affair.'

S'From the Bride Being a wedding photographer myself, I thought of my whole wedding in pictures. I have been obsessed with wedding since I was little and have been reading wedding blogs and magazines since way before I even met Brian. I knew I wanted something rustic and vintage but I also wanted to try not to do the same thing as everyone else. One of the most important things to me in planning our wedding was that everything reflected us and who we are. I knew immediately that I wanted to use my vintage camera collection and thought that centerpieces would be the best way to use them. But I also wanted to include Brian in them so we decided to use potted herbs because he is a cook and is amazing with seasonings. We both love to read and I love old books so we added those as well as teacups that we collected at thrift stores over the many months before the wedding.'

S'From The Bride I love telling the story of how Jimmy and I met because it gives me goose bumps just thinking about it! We met through a mutual friend at a bar near St. Louis University. I was with a big group of friends and for some reason, something inside me told me to find my friend Jarad. When I finally did, I found Jarad talking to Jimmy at the bar. They had not seen each other for a few years since going to school together at Mizzou. The funny thing is, Jimmy hated going to this bar and only went because it was his friend s birthday! Jarad introduced us and when I shook Jimmy s hand and looked into his eyes, it was love at first sight. Cheesy, I know- but it s true! We talked about Cardinals baseball for a long time, and I think I impressed him because we went out on our first date a week later! Over time we found out we had several mutual friends and we even got confirmed in the same church during the spring of 1999. Living minutes away from each other in the same city for 20 years, Jimmy and I often talk about how strange it was that we didn t meet sooner.'

S'From the Bride From the moment we got engaged, we knew we wanted to have a Chicago wedding. It is where we met and live so we wanted to share the city with our guests. The JW Marriott in the heart of the city was a great location, and the Burnham Ballroom was a gorgeous setting for our ceremony and reception. The ballroom held some of Chicago s history (the original ceiling from 1914), while adding elegant, modern touches such as the beautiful chandlers.'
p9820
aS'Even though our wedding was in October, we wanted to stay away from traditional fall colors. Our ceremony & reception took place in the same room, so we needed a lot of guidance and creativity to make the space unique for each event. I had envisioned a romantic garden scene for the ceremony. Something I wasn t sure would be possible inside a ballroom. Natalie, from Hello Darling, along with her team helped to make my general ideas so much more than I could have ever imagined. The reception room was then transformed into a beautiful romantic setting and we danced the night away to music performed by the Stitely Orchestra.\n'

The day was finally here and Brittany and Aaron seemed to carry a child-like anticipation as they prepared to see each other for the first time. In the lovely gardens that could be seen from their private balcony, Aaron slowly turned around to see his beautiful bride walking towards him. Breath taken away, he wrapped Brittany in his arms, so excited to make this girl he met back in the first grade his wife.'

aS'I contacted Exclusive Italy Weddings, and our wedding planner, Martina, was fantastic. She assisted us with booking the location, flowers, transportation, and the absolutely gorgeous reception location, Alle Murate. Because neither of us are Italian we had to arrive in Florence a few days early to complete several rounds of paperwork. Martina arranged for our wonderful new friend, Mrs. Jo, to serve as our translator and assistant through the paperwork and the ceremony. Our photographer, Amy Rizzuto, was amazing and such a pleasure to have around. She met with us prior to the ceremony to share her thoughts on the best time for photos, etc. and she couldn t have been more perfect. The pictures from our special day depict the love and emotions flowing from everyone involved. When I look at the photos I feel as if our wedding was a true fairytale.'

aS'After choosing a date, we had to pick a country. I am American, Oskar is Swedish, we met in the Caribbean, and we had chosen to buy our first home in the South of France where many of our friends live. In the end, we picked France, mostly due to it being where the least amount of people were required to fly in long distance. Having the venue sorted so late meant scrambling to plan everything else, and doing this in a new language in a country didn t make it easier. Plus, I decided early on that I wanted everything unique, everything DIY, no professional help other than catering, AND I wanted it to be very calm and relaxed on the days leading up to the big event. (Anyone reading this who has been married, feel free to laugh loudly and knowingly.)'

Thankfully, we found The Villa, a turn-of-the-century Spanish home, whose charm and elegance filled in our blank canvas quite quickly. The setting of the Villa and my love for nature inspired our invitations and decor. Every table had a distinct pair of antique brass birds, and at each place setting there was a favor of goat milk soap, handmade by the friendly Camlon Farms who we met at a farmer s market.'

S'From the Bride  Getting married on my family s ranch (Dos Pueblos Ranch), where we live and my husband Teddy works, has been a dream since I grew up there as a little girl. And what made our wedding day even more special was the fact that it was such a group effort and DIY event with the help of our amazing friends, family and the coordinator Kendle, from Lauren Kendle Events. She was a true life saver! I feel so grateful that everyone was such a huge part of our day. Right from the early stages of planning, we knew we wanted to make sure that it wasn t just a wedding, but a day that really represented us as a couple, and one that celebrated the ranch that I grew up on. Truly every detail and every vendor we chose had a connection with us. Our great friend and unbelievable artist, Katie Kramer, designed our wedding invitations with hand painted details of avocados and palm trees to represent the ranch. Our photographer Whitney turner, a very talented wedding photographer, was an easy choice, not just because she is our friend but also because we knew she would make us feel comfortable. Upon a recommendation from a friend, Nico from NLC productions did our flowers, and I knew he would be great the second I met him! He really blew it out of the park and worked with me on incorporating all those little  ranch style  details I wanted. Many of the details came from things we found on the ranch, such as the hawk and owl feathers used for my bouquet and the guys  boutonnieres, the lavender, and the abalone shells that served as place cards. My brother-in-law built an insane driftwood arch that Nico helped adorn with hanging orchids so dreamy. A jewelry designer from Santa Barbara, Marit Rae, who is a also a friend, made incredible crystal necklaces for the bridesmaids and matching crystal bracelets for my mother, mother-in-law, and flower girl.   During the ceremony, my cousin Max played a couple of Allman Brothers songs on his acoustic guitar, which was another important detail for us because my husband is big into music. The dance floor was hopping because of music from the band,   The Rawhides , who were a huge hit, as well as music from our friend Josh Hartley, who DJ ed the cocktail hour and provided dinner music. Josh was another easy choice since he understood our taste so well. Another easy choice was choosing Country Catering in Goleta. We had a menu of tri-tip, chicken, salad, and veggies, which is our food of choice when friends come over for a BBQ at our house. The whole venue was incredible, largely because of Bella Vista Lighting. They completely transformed the beach, making it look so beautiful and romantic with lighting over the ocean so the waves could be seen at night. In addition, a suspended chandelier hung between two palm trees and was beautiful. Apart from the vendors, we also did a lot of things ourselves. Teddy built a reclaimed wood bar from wood on the ranch, and an awesome tree stump cake stand. I made a giant driftwood heart that turned out to be a great photo op for guests. I strung an abalone shelled garland for the cocktail hour and hand painted signs to direct the guest traffic on the ranch from ceremony to reception. One of my favorite parts were the stamped blankets with the crest from our wedding invitation, which was an awesome idea from a friend. We feel so lucky that we were able to pull off such an incredible day. The ranch is such a special place to us, making it easy and fun to create the wedding we dreamed of, but we really couldn t have done it without the help of our family and friends.\n'

Luke met these guys in a little pub in Ireland, once upon a time. He told them he was going to fly them to America when he got married one day. The man keeps his word.

S'From Wendy Laurel  These two met each other in college and have been friends for seven years. But they only started being a couple two years ago. Nothing better than best friends who find their way into love. Both Emelie and Alex come from famiies in Canada with restaurant backgrounds. They chose a destination wedding in Maui but wanted a beautiful dinner party. The table as well as the delicious food was centerpiece of their wedding. And relaxing under the stars, enjoying their meal and cocktails surrounded by their family and best of friends, was the perfect wedding plan for them in Hawaii.\n'

During the ceremony, Candice and Perry collected these flowers from their mothers and created one large and beautiful flower arrangement together. This took the place of a traditional candle lighting or sand ceremony and was a beautiful metaphor for the combining of two families.'

Chicago is where we met, where our families still live and the city that will always be our home. When we started planning the wedding we planned our must have list; an intimate wedding, great music and an amazing dinner. I figured that it would be so easy to plan a wedding from Los Angeles, was I wrong. When a day of wedding appointments was all but ruined by flight cancellations and delays because of fog, we landed with enough time to make one appointment. Arriving at 7pm on Thanksgiving Eve, almost 5 hours late we were able to taste the most amazing food prepared by the team at Boutique Bites. We booked with them that night and luckily I was able to find equally awesome vendors and a wedding planner to help me design our wedding.'

We dated for almost six years before getting engaged on the Michigan Avenue Bridge over the Chicago River. We agreed immediately that we needed to get married in downtown Chicago. Planning a destination wedding was made carefree with our amazing wedding planner from Big City Bride. The week leading up to the wedding was filled with a Nikha, Mendhi and Walima all beautiful and colorful Muslim traditions. '

aS'Lee wore a one-shoulder style gown in soft chiffon. The bride had wanted something different; classic, yet modern, comfortable and able to flow in the Maui breeze.

The glass beads on the reception dress caught the lights and were a crazy, sparkly dance party dream.'

aS'Lee emerged for her walk down the aisle like a Greek goddess stepping from a cloud of soft sheer white drapes billowing in the wind. The dramatic and romantic beginning was accented by Lee s walk down the aisle on the arms of both her fathers. She approached her Adonis groom standing in front of a modern arch draped asymmetrically to echo the lines of her gown. Simple wooden benches matched the arch and provided guest seating. Carl s father, a Baptist minister, married the couple, adding a touching and personal element to the ceremony. As Lee and Carl sealed their vows with a kiss and turned to greet their guests, a flurry of purple ribbons filled the air and repeated the ribbon celebration from the venue entrance.'
p10511
aS'The draping kept the amazing lounge setup from view until after dinner when the doors opened and the band welcomed guests. The sheer drapes billowed out to welcome attendees into a Monte Carlo disco setting replete with a huge custom made disco ball chandelier, zebra candle lamps on cocktail club tables, and elegant lounge settings. A checkerboard dance floor invited everyone onto center stage, to groove to a seven piece live band. A fabulously sophisticated photo booth with a custom backdrop gave guests the chance to capture the moment in between visits to the gourmet coffee and dessert bar.'

S'From the Bride  My husband Gianni and I met in Calculus class while attending Cal Poly SLO. After graduating, we migrated up the coast to San Francisco and began working closely together at a small start up. After a decade, we knew that we would always be together, but it was only after a garage accident and ER difficulty that we decided to legalize our union. San Luis Obispo was where we cultivated the foundation of our relationship and we couldn t wait to return for a celebration!'
p10583
aS'We opted to create an atmosphere that was minimalistic, modern and full of texture, highlighting a centralized metal theme   an ode to my husband s hobby garage work. Our wedding colors were a neutral palette of champagne and varying light to dark grey tones. We kicked off our theme with miniature letter-pressed Save the Dates and engraved stainless steel formal invitations that I created. Next, we set out to find wedding attire that especially mirrored our aesthetic. My handmade Monique Lhuillier gown (the first dress I tried on) featured an extremely modern, but delicately folded, crumb-catcher bust with a stark contrast of disorganized, silk organza strips fluttering from my waist down to the ground. I wore no jewelry except handcrafted solid sterling silver octopus tentacle earrings   custom made for me by a friend   and my shoes were plain grey suede pumps. My husband s light grey Burberry suit was expertly tailored in SF with a custom made lavender shirt (to match his mother s dress) and an Italian wool pinstripe tie. He wore USA-made Wolverine high top boots, the Archimedes pilot watch my parents gave him as a wedding present and his favorite gentleman s folding knife. He radiated the likes of European Mad Men.'

aS'From Jenelle Kappe  Jennifer and Christopher are two of the sweetest people that I have every met!! The day of their wedding they were calling for rain and thunderstorms almost all day. Our plan had become to have them see each other before the ceremony and hope that we were able to be outside for at least a few pictures. Well, Mother Nature decided to cooperate with us and shine a full day of sun for Jennifer & Christopher. Not a drop fell. It was perfect!! They were able to have their outdoor ceremony as well as all of their pictures outside.\n\nJennifer s dress was so classically romantic. She looked absolutely stunning, it fit her perfectly!! From the bride, My Mom had a full lace dress for her wedding day. She looked so beautiful and romantic in her photos. So I knew I wanted to wear a lace dress for my wedding. When I found the dress, I fell in love with the gorgeous lace pattern and knew it was the one! '

S'As we started to plan, there were several must haves. First, was Paper Antler, our amazingly talented photographers. The day after we got engaged I reserved them for the entire month of August! We also knew we wanted our ceremony in an intimate outdoor setting, a reception with tall ceilings and at least one crystal chandelier, and a big dance floor! As fate would have it, the Hinsdale Golf Club, in the town where I grew up, met all our requirements. After picking a venue in my hometown, a hometown theme quickly developed. The bridal luncheon and rehearsal dinner were in Hinsdale. The flowers, invitations, and wedding cake were all designed by local vendors. And on the day of the wedding, my bridesmaids, five of which were friends who grew up with me in Hinsdale, and my sister (MOH) of course, and I spent the morning getting ready in my childhood home.'
p10707
aS'Our ceremony was very important to us. We really wanted the ceremony to be about us and our love for each other. Our officiant was a close friend of Blake s who was able to give us exactly that. He knew us and our story and was able to tell that to our family and friends. Until we started wedding planning, I always cringed when I heard people were writing their own vows. But when it came down to it, we both really wanted the words we said to mean something to us. So the two of us stayed up until 2:00am one night and wrote our vows together, incorporating words from traditional vows with promises that were special to us. Blake promised to make my laugh every day and I promised to never lose my sense of humor.'

Before arriving for their ceremony, they met in the lush Stevenson Garden, a smaller enclosed garden that was in between their hotel and the venue, for a sweetly emotional first look. Carly looked every inch the glamorous bride. Her bridal look started with a Tara Keely gown that she paired with appropriately sparkly gold shoes, and her classic updo and flawless makeup came courtesy of the girls at M.U.A.H.'

S'I didn t have an exact color scheme picked out for our wedding, but I knew I wanted more of a natural feel given that almost everything took place outside, so we went with a softer pallet of white/cream, blush, coral, mint, and gray. For the floral and d cor, Sharla Flock and her team created loose arrangements consisting of roses, hydrangeas, dahlias, lavender, berries, and pops of greenery. They used lanterns, wine barrels, candles, wooden boxes, mercury vessels, and farm tables to compliment the rustic beauty of the Napa Valley. We wanted to do something fun and different with the escort card table so Sharla placed the cards in wooden crates filled with fresh grapes, which turned out wonderfully. We incorporated those softer tones and the wine country theme of grapes and vines into our paper products as well, which we had an absolute blast designing with Kara Gordon of Magnificent Milestones in Chicago.'

aS'Our wedding day was truly a family affair, which made it even more special and most importantly, fun! Joe s oldest sister, Jenny, and her band D j  Vu flew in from Chicago to play at our ceremony and reception. Jenny was kind enough to sing my processional song, our unity cup song, first dance, and Joe s dance with his mom. Those are definitely moments that we will cherish for years to come. Joe s other sister, Lauren, who is the owner of LK Events in Chicago, helped us throughout the entire wedding planning process. We were very fortunate to have someone that was so knowledgeable and talented with us every step of the way. When I first moved to Chicago I worked with Lauren on many of her weddings and met some incredible vendors that we knew we wanted to be part of our day. Kristina Carter and Aaron Brouwer of Vrai Photography and the brilliant guys from I Do Films made the trip from Chicago as well. Reverend Nye, who officiated our ceremony, also baptized Joe as a baby, so having him there to marry us was very meaningful.'

But once I did, there has never been a doubt in my mind. I don t think there was  a moment  when we knew we were in this together forever. As we got to know each other we learned that we were two strange peas in a strange pod, and we wanted to sign up to spend a lifetime together in that pod. We are in  mutual weirdness,  which is love, according to Dr. Seuss.'
