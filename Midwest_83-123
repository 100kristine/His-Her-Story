S'Big City Bride and Fragrant Design did Chicago proud with this classic soiree. The wedding is the kind of beautiful event that will remain stunning and relevant forever, just like the love Allori Photography captured so brilliantly.'
p48
aS'From the beautiful bride  Sean and I met in college through mutual friends and started dating in May 2007 while we were at home for summer break. He was a senior at St. Xaiver and I was a junior at Illinois State University. We fell in love that winter and have been together ever since. Sean proposed at Notre Dame University on October 29th, 2011. The Irish were playing the Navy in football and we had a group of friends/family join us to tailgate and attend the game. While we were visiting one of the beautiful monuments  Touch Down Jesus  and taking a photo, he got down on one knee and proposed   most definitely one of the best days of our lives!'
p49
aS' Sean and I both come from strong Catholic/Irish backgrounds and both grew up on the Northwest side of Chicago. We were very happy to incorporate the full Catholic mass at a beautiful church in downtown Chicago. The music, readings, and bagpipes at the ceremony were exactly what we wanted for our day. We had amazing family and friends to be in our bridal party and my dad walking me down the isle was especially important to me.'
p50
aS' I could not be happier with the weather the day of our wedding, and one of my favorite moments was when my dad and I were standing outside of the church waiting to walk down isle and when the doors opened the sunlight crept right into the church and it was amazing! I was so happy to be walking down the isle and to see Sean s face light up was one of my favorite moment. We also really loved the exchange of vows and as nervous as we were having everyone looking up at us, it was a moment we will never forget. Walking down the isle with the Shannon Rover leading us out of the church was also memorable and it was a perfect moment to finally be husband and wife!'
p51
aS' I absolutely love fashion and everything to do with those  small  details that make such a difference. We were going for a  elegant/chic  wedding design. We wanted a larger wedding and wanted the entire pageantry of the day to show through. We agreed that we did not want the banquet style wedding that we see at most weddings we attend, but wanted something unique but keeping true to the elegance we wanted. The Chicago Cultural Center was the perfect spot!'
p52
aS' We always knew we wanted our wedding in downtown Chicago. Sean and I both grew up on the Northwest side of Chicago, but spend a lot of our time downtown in the heart of the city. We were so lucky to be able to stay and have our wedding in such a special spot. We were also lucky enough to photos in some of the best spots to show off the city view on the beautiful day we had   it was perfect! The Cultural Center was absolutely breathtaking and I could not believe all of the compliments we received after our wedding. The entire day was incredible and we could not be happier with how everything worked out!'

S'Fact: when DIY details and romantic moments combine, it s a really good day here at SMP.  The kind of day where you sit back, relax and soak in one beautiful moment after another from the talented Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema.  Because this is the kind of wedding that deserves your full attention   from the soft pink hues to the peony-filled blooms from Fabbrini s Flowers to the breathtaking Bloomingdale Golf Club setting.  See it all right here in the full gallery.'
p86
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema  We knew that Katie and Jon were special when we got together for their engagement session. That day started out rainy and gloomy, but these two were so cheerful and easy-going that in the end we were actually happy it rained! That s just how Katie and Jon are together   gracious, kind, thoughtful, and perfect for each other. They are two kind and gentle souls that just make everybody around them happy.'
p87
aS'Katie and Jon s wedding was just as sweet and charming as they are. Katie is a teacher, and their wedding tied this in with a vintage pastel theme. Light pinks and blues were used throughout the days in the delicate floral arrangements and detail elements. The reception tied in Katie and Jon s love of reading with stacks of books creating charming centerpieces, and words spelled out with scrabble letters served as table names. Katie and her mom created most of the decorative elements themselves, including the centerpieces, chalkboard signs, and escort cards.'

Their wedding celebration is set to unfold this December 31 on the ever-fabulous New Years Eve at the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati and the couple s entire team of vendors is so exited! Guests will be treated to not only a one of a kind party leading into 2014, but a special experience infused with personality, detail and lots of love. Their session was shot by the amazing Jen and Jonah this past spring in and around Cincinnati, and included a few nods to their wedding like oversized gold helium balloons and a healthy doze of confetti (details that will surely be seen on the big day). Also making an appearance in the photos is the couple s adorable dog, Doc. He too is counting down the days until the celebration!\n'

p188
aS'We chose the W City Center in Chicago, Illinois because it is our favorite hotel to stay at; in addition, the grand ballroom is neutral colored which was my number one request. We also fell in love with the old and new world vibe that the hotel entails.'
p189
aS'As far as decor, I knew I wanted an elegant and neutral color scheme. Being that it was New Year s Eve, our colors consisted of silvers, blacks, and whites. Since I am an English major and enjoy reading, we decided to add stacks of books to each centerpiece. Not only did they add height, but they also added a personal touch. We also added antique clocks to each centerpiece to symbolize the changing of time and they all buzzed in unison during the transition into 2013. We are thrilled with our decision to have had a New Year s Eve wedding which marks a new beginning for everyone!\n'

A drop-dead gorgeous love fest featuring a sophisticated color palette (hello black and white), lush (+ crazy amazing) florals from Chalet Floral and ombre details a plenty.  In other word, it s the epitome of awesome and you can see it all captured beautifully by Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema right here in the full gallery.'
p228
aS'And a little something special from Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema?  Yes, please.'
p229
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema  Spending the day with Darcy and Todd pretty much made us feel like the luckiest people in the world. Darcy and Todd are both such kind, thoughtful, people that they are an absolute pleasure to be around. They enjoyed every moment of their wedding day just as it was, undeterred by a little rain and a little Chicago traffic. Their wedding day was absolutely perfect just as it was.'
p230
aS'Darcy and Todd started the day at the JW Marriott, getting ready surrounded by friends and family. Darcy chose a sophisticated black and white color palette, with carefully thought out ombre details. The hangers for the bridesmaid dresses were decorated with carefully selected ombre ribbons, ranging from light gray to black. The bridesmaid bouquets and groomsmen s ties were also ombre with each bouquet and tie in a different shade of gray! Finally, the cake was a beautiful white to black ombre cake by West Town Bakery. The day also brought in a  Chicago  theme with a sleek skyline design created for the invitations.'
p231
aS'Darcy and Todd exchanged gifts before they saw each other, each revealing that they knew the other perfectly with Darcy choosing a Movado watch for Todd and Todd choosing a Louis Vuitton for Darcy!'
p232
aS'They held their first look in the grand hallway of the JW Marriott, and then we took off with the bridal party and families for photos around the city. In the afternoon we arrived to Fulton s on the River for an elegant ceremony. Elegant Event Lighting softened the urban space of Fulton s event room with beautiful white draping, and Chalet Floral brought white birch logs from Michigan to create a white, textured, setting.'
p233
aS'After the ceremony, guests stepped outside to the patio on the river for cocktails as the room was converted into a reception space. Chalet Floral hung an amazing birchbark and floral display above the head table, and the room was accented by beautiful lighting designs that reflected Darcy and Todd s city theme. This theme was also carried into the seating chart, which used a map of Chicago s  El  line and stations to list the tables.'

S'Weddings like this one captured by Megan Pomeroy make me want to cry tears of pure happiness, or at the very least kiss my computer screen. Because it simply doesn t get prettier than this, lovelies. With blooms from Shamrock & Thistle so beautiful I could stare at them forever, a color palette so fresh I plan on pinning every image, and one completely in love couple  - every detail planned by Lovestru.ck Weddings + Events is as good as they get, and you can see all of them right here.'
p274
aS'From Lovestru.ck Weddings + Events From the moment I met Tara and Randy almost ten months before their wedding, the couple knew they wanted a soft and romantic wedding using shades of pink and purple. Like all Lovestru.ck weddings, we wanted to design an event that spoke to the couple s personality and style, so we began the design process by getting to know the couple. We found that Tara s Italian heritage and Randy s German background played a large role in their lives, so we decided to utilize those strong cultural-ties in our design. Our first step was to focus the color palette. We kept the soft blush color, and we paired it with a wine-inspired reddish-purple tone.'
p275
aS'Lesley at Inclosed Studio crafted beautiful letterpress invites and day-of stationery inspired by vintage wine labels and leafy grape vines. She also designed a monogram for the couple that was used throughout the stationery suite.'
p276
aS'Tara wore a Monique Lhuillier gown accessorized with Haute Bride jewelry from Rhylan Lang. Her bouquet was wrapped with a piece of her mother s veil and adorned with an heirloom locket. The men wore slim-cut black suits, and each bridesmaid selected her own black dress.'
p277
aS'Tara and Randy were married in front of 200 guests during their traditional Catholic ceremony. Their guests showered the newlyweds as they exited the church with heart-shaped rice. The confetti was packaged in glassine bags, stamped with their gold-foil monogram, and sealed with a custom wax stamp.'
p278
aS'Guests were welcomed to the couple s lively reception by a hand-painted welcome sign that we framed in an ornate mirror. We hung wooden escort cards on mini garden hooks that were arranged in mounds of moss and centered around a grand centerpiece in the couple s wedding colors.'
p279
aS'Throughout their relationship, Randy and Tara created lists of restaurants to try, places to visit, and date-night activities. Over the last few years, they ve cross items off (ex: eat Philly cheesesteaks in Philadelphia) while adding new items (ex: go surfing) to the list. As a nontraditional guestbook, we instructed guests to fill a wooden book (purchased on Etsy) with their suggestions of items to add to the newlywed s to-do list.'
p280
aS'Shamrock & Thistle arranged earthy and lush centerpieces using deep red amartanthus, dark purple scabiosa, varying shades of garden roses, and the most stunning cafe au lait dahlias. The varying heights of centerpieces created visual interest in the dinner space, and the draping greens hung on the chandelier above the dance floor, carried the organic and airy-feeling florals throughout the reception venue.'
p281
aS'The head table was layered with pink textured linens from La Tavola. We had custom napkins embroidered with the couple s monogram for the couple to take home after the wedding as cherished mementos. We set a box of biscotti (a traditional Italian cookie) that doubled as a place card at each place setting. The table numbers were crafted out of cork and embellished with gold foil.'
p282
aS'As a late-night snack, Tara and Randy served German-inspired pretzel bites with beer cheese (so delicious!) and Italian-inspired mini cannolis and tiramisu bites. We stacked wine crates to create height for the food display, and Melissa from Pretty Paperie hand-lettered signs for all of the snacks using her artful and ornate lettering styles.'
p283
aS'We also had Melissa create signage for other focal areas at the reception. She lettered our bride and groom chair-back signs. Tara s sign read  Sposa  (or Bride in Italian), and Randy s sign read  Br utigam  (or Groom in German). Melissa lettered welcome signs and a sign for the card birdcage (both in written in Italian and German).'
p284
aS'Another memorable moment of the evening was the speech given by the bride s father:\n  I promised you a present on your wedding day and here it is. When I was in London earlier this year I got this I an antique store. It is an old Roman coin, from 830 AD almost two thousand years old. On the front of the coin is an emperor wearing a crown called a radiate. On the back is the Goddess Fortuna. So the crown radiate represents how the two of you and your love radiate whenever you are together. The Goddess Fortuna represents that you will have great fortune in your life. And may your love last as long as this coin has. \n'

p315
aS'From the Bride Nelson and I met through my college roommate, his sister, and started dated long distance traveling back and forth from Memphis and Chicago. Our long-distance relationship continued for over two years until Nelson made the move to Chicago. It was in the Windy City that we began to build our life together, experiencing as much of it as we possibly could, and easily making Chicago our home. Three years later Nelson picked up the engagement ring he had designed on his way home from work and immediately proposed on Oak Street Beach. From there the wedding planning began!'
p316
aS'Our vision for our wedding day was simple. We wanted an intimate setting where our friends and family could be relaxed, have fun, and most importantly have a smile on their faces from the moment they walked into the venue until they woke up the next morning. I think we more than succeeded because not only did both our mothers tell us that they had never had more fun in their entire lives but also many of our friends and family thanked us for steering away from the norm and making our wedding day uniquely us in almost every detail. We choose a yellow and gray color scheme because, well, if you stepped foot into our apartment you d know I love yellow and gray. Then when I saw the amazing bridesmaids dresses at Jenny Yoo, in the perfect mustard yellow, there was no going back. We also decided to work in a Chicago theme since most of our guest were from out of state (we had friends and family from over 20 states) and we wanted to take the opportunity to highlight some of our favorite things about the City we call home.'
p317
aS'During the planning process I quickly learned that I got my DIY gene from my amazing mother. While I concentrated on designing and coordinating of all our stationary details, with the help of a family friend, my mom got on her sewing machine! She made robes for all my bridesmaids, flags for the ringbears to carry down the aisle, even Mr. and Mrs. pillows for our seats, just to name a few!

S'I ve always been fond of backyard weddings. Especially when that backyard happens to be the bride s childhood home. It s the sweetest of all  I do  locales, made EVEN sweeter through the lens of Laura Ivanova Photography. And while I could go on for days about the beautiful bloomage a la Mickey O Kane Floral or the gorgeous styling by Sable Event Styling & Design, let me direct you to the full gallery for all that plus soooo much more.'

aS'From the Bride  Stephen and I met in Boston one week before I moved to Chicago, but we both knew we had found something too special to pass up. After two years of dating long distance, I moved back to Boston and we were engaged four months later. We wanted our wedding to be filled with special touches that delighted our guests and represented who we are as a couple. With all of our friends and family traveling long distances to be a part of the celebration, it was important to us that our guests were swept up in the day as much as we were!'
p358
aS'My childhood home in Minnesota was the perfect backdrop for our vintage, garden party inspired wedding. The cocktail hour among the trees and tented reception beneath the flickering lanterns that hung from their branches set the perfect tone and allowed us to make the day completely our own. I especially loved crafting all of the elements myself   from the place cards to the table runners, the corn-hole boards to the welcome flags on every straw   it was amazing to see our dream become a reality. It was my favorite craft project to date and has inspired me to turn my creativity into an event styling business of my own!'
p359
aS'We loved how Laura Ivanova Photography was able to so accurately capture the love and happiness we both felt throughout our wedding day. She captured all of the little moments that were so special to us, and will cherish for years to come. Our wedding was the most wonderful day in our lives to date, and we are so excited to be married!'

It s beautiful decor from Life Made Pretty meets happily ever after and you can see it all captured by the amazing Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema right here in the full gallery.'
p387
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema  I am so excited to share the prettiest proposal we have ever seen! When Jim started planning how he would propose to Autumn, he knew just where to do it. Though they currently live on opposite sides of the country, in a few months they will be meeting in the middle with a move to Chicago. Their new home seemed like the perfect place to surprise Autumn with the perfect proposal.'
p388
aS'It didn t take long, however, for him to realize that planning something special from across the country wouldn t be easy. Jim enlisted the help of CityGirl Weddings to help him create something truly special. Shar from CityGirl brought in some amazing partners, including Life Made Pretty, who provided the gorgeous florals and the perfect, romantic, setup. It was truly like a dream, one of the most romantic proposals we have ever seen! We were absolutely blown away!'
p389
aS'Jim and Autumn started out with dinner at North Pond restaurant. As they finished, they walked up through Lincoln Park where they were serenaded by a guitar player, and on to this romantic setting where Autumn found a bottle of champagne and a personal poem that Jim wrote just for her. Jim got down on one knee, and of course, Autumn said yes!'

It s filled to the brim with whimsy and fun, not to mention one pretty color palette, making every image snapped up by Rachael Schirano a pure joy to peruse. Lucky for all of us, the fun continues right here in the full gallery.'
p420
aS'From the Bride Ryan and I met for drinks one night after exchanging a few silly messages about our favorite candy back and forth on a dating site. After a few hours of banter about our families, work, and music, I left with a huge smile on my face, knowing I had to see him again. We both immediately noticed how comfortable we felt together, like we had known each other forever. A year and half later Ryan proposed to me downtown Chicago in front of the Chicago theater, my friends and family, and a hoard of surprised tourists on the sidewalk.'
p421
aS'As soon as Ryan and I got engaged we knew we wanted to get married at Bloomington Country Club, because it s Ryan s home town and the club always looks so beautiful in the summer. We chose shades of purple and pink for our colors, because I love bright colors and felt they were the perfect colors for the transition from Summer to Fall since we were getting married over Labor Day weekend.'
p422
aS'Ryan and I love to be silly and laugh so we wanted to make sure there was an element of fun throughout the wedding. We did this, for example, by finding Mario and Peach from Super Mario Bros. for our cake toppers on Etsy and using giant purple balloons in our photos. Ryan is admittedly a comic book nerd, so all of the groomsmen wore different superhero masks for their entrance into the reception and the girls wore bright pink bows on their heads, which were a hit with all the ladies being passed around to each guest all night. Ryan s love for comics was also integrated into our Save the Date s designed by our friend Colleen Clark, who is a graphic designer in Bloomington. She designed them to look like a comic strip and we had a great time shooting the pictures of Ryan pretending to save me from an oncoming train. He is my own personal superhero :)'
p423
aS'Ryan and I aren t very traditional so we kept our ceremony short and sweet, but full of meaning. We wrote our vows expressing our love; mine included the fact that Ryan is able to make me laugh every single day and feel supported no matter what. Ryan recited Adam s Sandler s  I want to grow old with you , which immediately made me smile and relax my nerves, something he is always able to do. To honor Ryan s Irish heritage and wanting to do something unique, we incorporated a Celtic tradition called  hand fasting  into our ceremony. Our hands were wrapped in silver and ivory cord to signify our unity bound forever by our vows.'
p424
aS'When planning the overall look for the wedding I went with more contemporary designs choosing chevron and ikat to be incorporated into our invites and signage at the wedding. I worked with Courtney Callahan in Chicago to design every element of the invitations, which was really fun. I used non-traditional wording to make sure people knew right from the beginning this wouldn t be your typical country club wedding. The ombre purple chevron design from the invites was including on all of our signage as well.'
p425
aS'For the tables, I chose silver and white chevron napkins and had an ikat table sign made to pull in the design from the invites. We also created a simple menu using purple and pink font to complement the bright pink hydrangeas in the centerpieces. I love mercury glass so I scoured all the craft stores to collect as many mercury glass votives I could find and scattered them over all of the tables.'
p426
aS'Another favorite part of the wedding planning was the dessert buffet. I love dessert and I especially love pie so I was determined to offer a handful of delicious choices. We had three amazing cakes made by Sugar Mama in Bloomington. Basically the only reason we had three cakes is simply because I couldn t choose which decoration I liked the best! The hot pink ombre two-tier cake not only looked gorgeous, it tasted amazing. The options were definitely a great decision since all the guests piled their plates high with dessert with all three cakes and 24 pies being consumed by the end of the night!'
p427
aS'We decided to offer two signature cocktails to serve at the wedding with names that represented significant events in our relationship.  Cleo s Cooler  was a delicious strawberry mojito named after the bar we went to on our first date.  State & Lake Sipper  was a long island iced-tea named after the intersection in Chicago where Ryan proposed to me. Anyone who knows me, knows that I don t drink anything without a straw, so we bought lavender and white striped straws to top them off.'
p428
aS'Our overall goal was to plan a wedding that represented both of us, with a contemporary and whimsical aspect, that still felt classy and put together. Everything at the wedding was the result of our ideas and since we helped design everything, it felt very personal. It was an amazing day that we will never forget!\n'

S'When a stunning park setting and an adorable bride and groom come together for a couple of  I do s,  it s a beautiful, beautiful thing.  The kind of affair, in fact, that you only see in fairytales  or those uber-romantic movies.  So to say that we were just a tad bit excited to dive into every last gorgeous detail of this stunning day captured by Kina Wicks is, well  one serious understatement.  And the gallery of drop-dead gorgeous images?  Beyond breathtaking.  Join me there for so much more.'
p465
aS'From Kina Wicks Photography  Kelly and John had a day that was flawless. They got ready on different floors of John s parents  home, and the excitement was palpable. You can see the excitement in the cool photo of the bridal party on different floors of the house! It was taken before the bride and groom had seen each other yet and was such a fun idea they had. Kelly & John have such a nice mixture of being best friends and truly obviously still crushing on one another! I loved the little ways that they show love and respect to one another. When they exchanged love notes to each other during their first look, they were generous enough to share the words with me ahead of time  my favorite quote was one of John s   A lifetime together lies shortly ahead.  I know he means it. Their day reflected their beautiful, quiet, mature relationship at Cantigny Park in Wheaton, IL. The setting along with the people who surrounded them gave them a wedding they will always cherish.'

S'Fair warning to those of you in the midst of planning your wedding. One look at this wedding from The McCartneys and you ll be tempted to throw out every plan you ve already made, book your tickets to Elkhart Lake, start sewing all new programs, and grab as many cake balls as you can along the way. It s just that good.'
p522
aS'From the beautiful bride  We re both into triathlons and running races, so our save the dates were  race bibs  with 8.24.13 as the running number. Eric came up with the idea, and I made them all by hand over Thanksgiving with her family on an assembly line.'
p523
aS' Since the ceremony was outdoors on the beautiful Osthoff grounds near the gazebo, we tried to plan for a theme of  natural garden tones . Kind of rustic and casual at the same time   with mason jars, crates, window shutters, barn wood frames, etc. The colors were light green, beige, and blush pink. Since the reception was indoors in a ballroom, we had to design multiple vignettes to try to bring the outdoors in. Andrea s aunt grew flowers for her in her Minnesota garden, and brought them all the way to the wedding to use in the vignettes. Each place setting had an herb sprig on the menu.'
p524
aS' We also wanted to make sure that the wedding had some fun personal touches. We served Spotted Cow beer from Wisconsin (one of our favorites!), had WI cheese and sausage appetizers during cocktail hour, and had a  Mr. & Mrs  corn hole/bags board outside on the lawn for our guests to enjoy.\n One of our favorite elements at the wedding was the desserts bar. Eric s family owns a chocolate store in Birmingham, Michigan. We ordered hundreds of chocolate truffles, cake pops, sugar cookies, almond bark, and chocolate covered pretzels. In addition to red velvet wedding cake, guests were able to pack up a bag of desserts and take it home with them. And it was amazingly styled by Katie Jayne from Jayne weddings, who showcased all the desserts in vintage crates and milk glass jars, and created a gorgeous backdrop to make it a focal point of the room. It was a huge hit  the entire desserts table was gone by the end of the night!'
p525
aS' Eric actually proposed at the Osthoff Resort when we were there last year July. We went up to Elkhart Lake for a triathlon one weekend. My parents came up to watch them in the race on Saturday. Then on Sunday Eric surprised me with room service breakfast (french toast   her favorite!) on the balcony overlooking the lake. Afterwards he brought out the champagne & strawberries, he made a toast and proposed right then and there! We enjoyed a leisurely day on the lake, got a massage at the Osthoff s amazing Aspira Spa, and then he surprised me again by having her entire family join them for brunch at the American Club in Kohler, WI.'
p526
aS' When we started planning our wedding, we started thinking back upon our favorite weddings that we ve attended as guests. They all shared a couple common connections: an awesome venue with a beautiful setting. Whether it be in Jamaica, California, Chicago, or Cleveland   we knew we wanted to pick a spot that was fun for everyone to enjoy, and where we could enjoy a portion of the wedding outdoors. It became obvious that the Osthoff would be our wedding destination from the very beginning. It was sentimental to me (because my family used to vacation in Elkhart Lake when I was growing up), it was a special place for us as a couple (because we got engaged there), and we knew that our guests would enjoy everything that Elkhart Lake has to offer   swimming, boating, hiking around the lake, live music on the beach, shopping, and dining.'
p527
aS' Lots of wedding elements were DIY, and while I spearheaded the efforts, there are lots of people to thank for their help and contributions! Since we live in downtown Chicago, we don t have a lot of space to  craft . So we went up to my matron of honor s parent s house in Racine, Wisconsin for a full day of spray painting and woodworking. Megan and her parents helped out   so we accomplished a lot in one day!'
p528
aS' There were also multiple craft nights to prep additional wedding materials. My college friends came over one night to help me hand-make all the wedding programs. We cut out all the kraft paper, program paper, and flags   and then I used a sewing machine to sew it all together. Additionally, my other Chicago girlfriends came over to help create the Thank You Chalkboard and signs that hung up on the white window shutters.'
p529
aS' When everyone was eating dessert, Kelsy & Butch snuck us out at sunset to get some pictures down by the beach. As we were walking along the water, a group of little girls started gathering behind me. You could hear them say to one another  Wow, it s a real princess!  and  She s soooo pretty.  They hid behind the lawn chairs and would peek out their heads from behind them to watch us getting our pictures taken. Then as we were walking away, the shouted  No, don t leave us!  It was the cutest thing ever. Definitely a moment we ll never forget.'
p530
aS' Since the wedding was in the middle of the Osthoff grounds, the guests sitting out on their balconies could watch our ceremony from afar from outside their rooms. As we exited the ceremony to the recessional music, all of our guests cheered and clapped. Then as we walked away, all the balcony guests who were watching our ceremony started cheering for us! It was a fun moment that made us laugh.'
p531
aS' In the middle of the reception dancing, the resort s fire alarm went off. We kept dancing through it for a song or two, but then had to evacuate the reception for a few minutes until the fire department knew it was a false alarm. I guess our guests were having too much fun that they just  burned up the dance floor! '
p532
aS' I got this great advice via email from one of Eric s family members who recently got married. I got the same advice from my married bridesmaids as well. Since it was highly recommended from multiple people, I did it   and it turned out to be one of the best memories of the whole night!'
p533
aS'  Just wanted to say hello. I hope you are enjoying the last push of organizing and planning and that your plans are coming together. I know you ve probably gotten about a million pieces of unsolicited advice but I wanted to share something with you that someone told me before our wedding. Feel free to use it or trash this angrily!! We had a great time during our reception and we remember most of it but we were also pulled in a ton of directions and were a little frazzled. One of my friends told me beforehand that we should do this, and I did and it was a pretty great moment/memory.\n Designate one of your friends family to pull you aside at some point during your reception. When this happens just take a few minutes together to stand off to the side and take in every thing and everyone. It s really an awesome feeling to see everyone together having a ton of fun and it s a neat memory for later. It s kinda sappy, I know but it really hit me pretty hard how loved we are seeing everyone there and having a grand time.  '
p534
aS' Also, my matron of honor gave me a journal when I got engaged, to document all the special moments leading up to the wedding, and of course memories from the big day. I actually ended up using it, and now it s full of great stories, pictures and mementos from the entire process start to finish. It took a lot of work, but I know I ll be thankful someday in the future that I have it!\n'

And this Kuhs Farm wedding from White-Klump Photography is the perfect way to do just that. It s overflowing with lovely, so grab your second cup of jo and head on into the gallery for even more.'
p575
aS'From White-Klump Photography .When I first heard the details of this wedding I couldn t wait to be a part of it all. Susan and Kevin are two of the most fun loving and carefree couples I know! Susan said,  Being older we knew we didn t want a typical wedding. We had already been to a million of the same kind of wedding.  Susan and Kevin stayed true to their word. They decided to hold their even at the breathtaking Kuhs Farm right outside St. Louis, Missouri. The pre-ceremony was filled with yard games such as corn hole, croquet, washers, and horseshoes. Parasols were given to the guests as they played, sipped on intoxicating lemonade from the adult lemonade stand and listened to a blue grass band. Then it was time for the ceremony which took place to the monumental oak tree at the estate complete with old wooden doors that led the aisle and also served the purpose as programs. Bridesmaids and bridesman wore navy dresses and navy striped ties with a hint of coral. Cocktail hour consisted of hayrides around the farm, petting zoo, and popcorn station. The reception was held in a tent on top of the hill that overlooks the Missouri River. Exclusive Events designed a gorgeous streamer chandelier that really added to the whimsical nature of the tent. Centerpieces included peach, coral, and gold accents. The food added to the fun loving nature. Guests were served a seven course meal all family style of the couple s favorite food such as bbq brisket, gourmet macaroni and cheese, and cucumber salad. Between dancing the night away guests also enjoyed a bonfire complete with all of the s more fixings and a firework display that could have easily doubled as the Fourth of July St. Louis Fair.\n'

S'When it comes to a SMP-worthy wedding, pretty pictures are a must. Steal-worthy details are at the top of the list as well. A beautiful gown never hurts. But the thing that makes it a YES every time is the palpable love, like that in this wedding from Rouxby. Adrianne Elizabeth Events was inspired by that special bond and planned a beautiful wedding inspired by it!'
p630
aS'From the stunning bride  Willy and I met each other in college while at Ohio State; we would see each other when my sorority & his fraternity would get together for social functions I always thought he was kinda cute and fun, but other than a few interested glances here and there, a relationship didn t ensue.'
p631
aS'Fast forward to seven years later when I ran into him on May 1st 2010. Willy had moved back to Columbus 3 months earlier and I was thrilled to see him as I had always wondered what happened to that cute boy I used to like in college. We were inseparable from that night on. The following day we met for brunch, went to a Columbus Clippers game and had dinner & drinks afterwards. The rest is history '
p632
aS'In the Fall of 2012, Willy and I started planning his lifetime dream vacation, a trip to Alaska. On September 11th, 2012, we were in Ketchikan, Alaska, the first stop of our Alaskan cruise. He had booked an excursion for us to take a seaplane ride. Those who know me, know that I have severe anxiety about flying. Needless to say, I was not excited about the plane ride. The plane landed at a remote dock in Misty Fjords National Monument and I still had no clue my life was about to change for the rest of my life. After a few individual pictures, the pilot asked to take a picture of the two of us. Next thing you know, Willy dropped to his knee and asked me to be his wife!'
p633
aS'Planning began a few weeks later and obviously started with wedding dress shopping! The day a girl has dreamed about for forever, the ladies of La Jeune Mariee were amazing! After only 7 dresses, I found the one. If only finding a wedding venue was just as easy!'
p634
aS'Willy and I looked at a handful of venues before going with The Columbus Athenaeum. We knew when we had seen the Large Theater that it was perfect, it is such a unique and amazing space.'
p635
aS'After finding my dress, I didn t want Willy to see me before the ceremony until I was walking down the aisle to him. It was definitely worth it, the sight of tears in his eyes and him telling me that I ve never looked more gorgeous gave me the same butterflies that started in college.'
p636
aS'Willy and I had known that if the weather was nice on our wedding day, we wanted to drive off from the church in his 1971 Chevelle. Not only was the weather perfect, but the car made for some of our favorite photo moments.'
p637
aS'A few weeks before the wedding, we got this fantastic idea of having The Ohio State Marching Band make a surprise appearance at the reception. It took a few special arrangements by The Athenaeum, DJ and our wedding planner, Adrianne to pull off the surprise for all our guests. In the middle of  Jessie s Girl , the music cut off to the disappointment of quite a few groomsmen. In marched the band like a football Saturday in Ohio Stadium. The guests went crazy, and all of the planning was well worth it to see the joy on all of our friends and families faces.'
p638
aS'The day was everything I hoped it to be and more. I have never felt more beautiful and loved than I did on that day. The amount of love that Willy and I felt from our friends and families made us both speechless and teary eyed at the end of the night. Seeing all of the people that we love dearly come together for us meant the world to me.'

S'Some of  you (especially those of you in North Carolina) might recognize this beautiful bride. She s a news anchor on Fox News Rising in Charlotte and it is our greatest pleasure to be able to share her big day with you. And we ve got it all, from Kelly Sweet Photography, from the gorgeous gown hanging in her parents home to the first dance under the trees and chandeliers. I just really hope you ve got some time to kill in the gallery because it just keeps getting better!'
p680
aS'It wouldn t be these two without a fabulous video (the groom s an actor!) and Blueberry Creative definitely stepped up to the plate with this highlight film \n'
p681
aS'From the beautiful bride  To some, Nick and Tara s relationship- from their first date to the big day- can be summed up with one word: Fairytale.\n But if you were to ask the couple, they would sum up the last seven years with a single word: Adventure- A beautiful, challenging, exciting adventure; one they ve enjoyed every single step of the way.'
p682
aS'Nick and Tara met on campus at Hope College in Holland, Michigan. They connected first on the volleyball court during an intramural volleyball game. Tara says their relationship began as friends, then slowly evolved into something more when- by random chance- the two both enrolled in the same study-abroad program to Ireland. It was there, in the rolling green hills of a country they both felt drawn to, that they fell in love. Their lust for life, exploration, trying new things and meeting new people bonded these two together.'
p683
aS'Tara and Nick are no ordinary couple, nor do they follow the path most often traveled. Nick is an actor and entrepreneur. Tara is an evening news anchor in Charlotte, North Carolina. To their friends, they are the  Hollywood Couple - to them, they are just two crazy kids fulfilling their dreams. When they are not in front of cameras, they are planning out their next adventure. It s hard to find a rare-open afternoon where Nick and Tara aren t hiking, sailing, paddle-boarding, wine-tasting, traveling, spending time with family, or quite honestly, laughing. These two love life  and each other.'
p684
aS'Though it wasn t until November 4th, 2011 that the couple decided to make that love official. Unlike many of their friends, they didn t want rush into marriage, so they didn t. They dated nearly seven years before Nick decided to pop the question, and when he did, he blew it out of the park.'
p685
aS'At the time, they were both living in Grand Rapids Michigan. A few weeks prior, Tara had accepted a job as the new host of  Fox News Rising  in Charlotte, NC and her family in Stevensville, Michigan was planning a good-bye dinner to celebrate their new chapter. That afternoon, Tara had a speaking engagement at her alma-mater and Nick was suppose to meet her there so they could drive to her parents  house together. She recalls waiting two hours for him before he called to say that he was running late and couldn t meet her.  I told her to go on without me,  says Nick.  I was so annoyed,  says Tara. Nick laughs recalling the moment,  It was all part of my plan! '
p686
aS'What Tara didn t know at the time was that Nick was already at her parents  house setting up for the most romantic proposal ever; one that would surely surprise the woman he knew, was hard to surprise! On the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, Tara s favorite spot in the world, Nick set up a red carpet, lined with tiki torches, rose petals, candles and music  it was there, he popped the question.'
p687
aS' It was such a special moment!  says Tara.'
p688
aS'Once the couple moved to Charlotte and got settled in, Tara began planning their Michigan wedding for June 29th, 2013. Thanks to the help of many people (and Pinterest!) they were able to execute the wedding of their dreams.'
p689
aS'Tara and Nick were married on a beautiful summer day in the bride s hometown of Stevensville, Michigan. She wore a form-fitting lace Enzoani gown, he wore a custom-made Abbeydale suit. They exchanged their own vows in St. John Catholic Church in nearby Benton Harbor, followed by a fairy-tale reception at her parents  home on Lake Michigan; the same beautiful, special spot Nick proposed. Tiki torches scattered the property, a vintage crystal chandelier hung from a 75 year old Oak tree over the dance floor, and music, laughter, and the sound of waves and dune grass blowing in the summer breeze set the fun and romantic tone of the evening.'
p690
aS'Tara wanted the evening to reflect her laid-back style. The bridesmaids wore two different style dresses- a short, one-shoulder, light pink chiffon dress. The other, a strapless beige chiffon dress. Each bridesmaid was encouraged to display their own personal style- from their hair and nail-polish color to their make-up and shoes.  I wanted them to be themselves!  says Tara. And the romantic feel of the soft color palette all together was very romantic, exactly was the bride was hoping for.'
p691
aS'Another favorite for the bride: A white vintage couch placed right in the dune grass overlooking the lake. It made for amazing bridal party pictures! And the guests loved taking their own pictures on it during the reception.'
p692
aS'Other than mood lighting, executed beautifully by tiki torches, candles, street lamps and a large chandelier hanging above the dance floor, Tara s other main priority was music. They hired the Jerry Ross Band out of Detroit, Michigan. And according the couple, they rocked the house! The dance floor was packed all night long. The couple s first dance was to  I ll be  by Edwin McCain, the bride s favorite song.'
p693
aS'The grooms main priority; DESSERT! Nick has quite the sweet tooth. With that in mind, instead of getting a large wedding cake, the couple opted for a small cake and a large dessert table full of cupcakes, cake-pops, tarts, brownies, shooters, etc. They also set up a separate candy-bar table.  It was amazing!,  says Nick.'
p694
aS'Other special DIY touches at the reception; a wooden sign nailed to a large tree displaying all their travel destination spots and how many miles away they were from the reception location. We also made little signs designating certain areas, for example,  Beach   Bonfire  and for the dance floor,  Dance your faces off! - We didn t want to take ourselves too seriously! According to guests, everything was so  Tara & Nick. '
p695
aS'The couple s favorite moment of the night: Stepping near the top of the bluff together, turning around and overlooking the entire reception.  The love and laughter in the air was electric,  says Nick.'
p696
aS'And it truly was.  Our reception was nothing short of magical. The dune where we held the reception was so special to me- it s where I would play, sit, and think as a child,  says Tara,  ..to have all of our loved ones there meant the world to me. We had to jump through so many hoops to have the reception at that location, but we made it happen. '
p697
aS'And making things happen is what Nick and Tara are all about. They thrive on new challenges, yearn for new adventures, and enjoy tackling life hand-in-hand every step of the way.'
p698
aS' Life is a journey.. and I couldn t be happier tackling life s greatest adventures with the woman of my dreams,  says Nick.'
p699
aS'Marriage, they say, is their favorite adventure yet. And executing the perfect wedding.. was step #1.\n'

And this couple, gave her so very much to work with in a St. Louis garden inspired wedding woven with pretty touches like peach garden roses whipped up by Wildflowers and a lace dress by Vera Wang that will forever be one of my favorites. So go ahead, grab all the pretty peaks your heart desires right here in the full gallery.'

aS'From the Bride  David and I met at a dive bar in Denver. I had just moved to Denver a few months before from Chicago and my roommates had convinced me to go out on the town. I remember seeing David across the bar and thinking he was handsome. David came up to me a bit later and told me that I looked familiar. I let him probe with questions for a bit but having just moved there I knew it was unlikely we had met before. I thought that it had been a cute pick up line though! Later David told me this was the pick up line his brother had used on his future wife and that is why he had used it. Somehow during our conversation we ended up talking about my favorite ice cream in Denver (salted oreo, so good) and we made a date to get some the next night. Our ice cream date lasted into the morning hours talking under the stars. I called my Mom the next day and told her I had met the man I was going to marry. David and I saw each other the next 10 days in a row and the rest is beautiful, ice cream filled history.'
p735
aS'David and I spend a lot of time outside; adventures in nature are a big part of the reason we each moved to Denver. After we got engaged we knew our top priority was to be surrounded by the beauty of the outdoors. While on a visit to St. Louis to see David s family we were on our way to get .. ice cream (I told you it is big part of our relationship) and we saw the Worlds Fair Pavilion in Forest Park lit up at night perched atop a beautiful hill. We chose it that night as our location and from there prioritized the comfort of our guests, the incorporation of our casual style, and making the nature and the outdoors center stage. Our vision included a more casual garden attire, lots of lush green garden inspired florals, giant palms, and the simplicity of twinkle lights highlighting an incredible terrace overlooking the park. My Mom and I made fan programs, and fabric ribbons to wave for our recessional. We were so pleased that our day really felt like us and embodied our life together, and beyond grateful to share it with the people we love the most.\n'

S'I love a good surprise. I m awful at pulling them off! But I sure do like them. So when I read that this sweet couple surprised their entire guest list with a wedding that no one knew was happening? I was bursting with excitement and quite honestly, impressed beyond words. Of course, Lovestru.ck Weddings + Events was there to help pull off every pretty detail, while The Mullers snapped up every jaw-dropping moment. Join in all the fun right here in the gallery and don t miss the look on the guests faces in the film by Creative Films!'
p786
aS'From Lovestru.ck  I have known Jocelyn since the first day she opened her bridal salon in Omaha. Since then, we ve shared in helping multiple brides get married in the Midwest. I knew Jocelyn had been dating her boyfriend, Paul, for nearly fourteen years, so I wasn t surprised when she asked me this past summer to help plan her wedding. But Jocelyn did have a trick up her sleeve. No one knew Paul and Jocelyn were actually engaged. She wanted her nuptials to be a complete surprise for her guests.'
p787
aS'Jocelyn set a date for three months after our initial planning meeting, so we quickly got to work. The bride-to-be wanted her wedding to feel timeless, but we knew we had to come up with fresh and innovative design concepts for Jocelyn who is constantly surrounded by wedding details in her line of work. We drew inspiration from notable dress designers and threw in some highly-personal details along with a few whimsical touches. The french blue and opal color palette was inspired by two Amsale bridesmaid dresses carried in Jocelyn s store. We even ordered extra Amsale fabric to make a custom linen for the cake table.'
p788
aS'One of the hardest decisions for Jocelyn to make was her gown selection. After brainstorming many options, she choose a gorgeous gown from Kelly Faetanini, a newly acquired line at her store. The fit-to-flare gown had a sweetheart neckline and was covered in a stunning gilded guipure lace. We soon realized we had to be very strategic about how we planned the couple s wedding. The goal was to gather guests at a cocktail lounge under the pretense that Paul was going to surprise Jocelyn and propose to her in front of all of their family and friends. Once guests arrived at the cocktail hour, they would learn that the couple was actually getting married that night and be shuttled to the church and back to a reception at an art gallery across the street from the cocktail lounge.'
p789
aS'Inclosed Studio created invitations for the cocktail hour/surprise engagement. Jocelyn loves stationery, so she wanted the invitation to be a work of art, but they had to be designed with more masculine touches as the invitation had to look like it was coming from Paul. In order to give Jocelyn the invitation suite she s always dreamed of, we decided to use stationery to reveal the evening s true intentions. Inclosed created a gorgeous invitation along with an paper accordion that was filled with the evening s timeline, the ceremony program, and each guest s escort card. We attached the envelope bundles to a floating wall, and prompted guests to grab their marked envelope as they entered the cocktail hour. I was so glad Creative Films was able to capture many of the guests  astonished reactions.'
p790
aS'After guests picked their jaws up off the floor, they grabbed a drink at the bar as they waited for the shuttles to the ceremony. We bundled chicken salad sandwiches on mini croissants and sweet potato chips in boxes for guests to eat on the bus ride and to tide them over during the couple s catholic ceremony. The element of surprise created a palpable energy in the church, as just over one hundred guests witnessed Jocelyn and Paul s nuptials. After the ceremony, the newlyweds exited the church through a tunnel of sparklers and rode to their reception in a 51 Chevy Convertible.'
p791
aS'Guests were once again surprised as they entered the reception. Blooms and Bouquets transformed the art gallery with gorgeous chiffon draping and clusters of chandeliers. Guests were offered a Wedding Cake Cocktail made of vanilla vodka, ginger ale, and fresh raspberry as they found their seats. The table numbers were marked by different years the couple had dated as well as a fun memory from each year. Attitude on Food served a delicious family-style meal to all of the guests. The couple chose to serve their wedding cake a la mode in honor of their late fathers who often shared their love of ice cream with their children after dinner. The bride and groom both love donuts, so we created a wall of donuts for guests to enjoy throughout the evening. We gladly turned a blind eye as the groom s nephews decided to have pre-dinner donut.'
p792
aS'Usually we deem a wedding successful based on the guest experience and the flow of the evening, but we felt extremely proud to help Jocelyn and Paul achieve their top secret mission of throwing a surprise wedding without a hitch!'

p846
aS'From the Bride  We planned a southern inspired, formal, summer evening; focusing on family and friends, and set in a white and gold hued space in the Hawthorne House. We fell in love with the Hawthorne house because of it s southern charm and gorgeous white palette inside; which married well with the rest of our wedding ideas! The ceremony was held at my childhood church, Holy Trinity Catholic Church in historic Weston, MO. The color palette included strawberry reds, blushes, corals, and peaches and gold with accents of creams and whites. I wanted the wedding to be formal with a touch of glamour! My favorite accent was the sparkly gold table linens at the reception!'
p847
aS'We are midwesterners at heart! But we both have been influenced by our life on the east coast, which was subtly included in our decor, food and attire. I worked with a designer and had my wedding dress custom made as well at Matt s suit custom made as well to fit our personalities!'
p848
aS'Our food at the reception started off with a cheese bar for our guests and ended with a dessert bar full of our favorite sweet treats! My mom also made homemade buttermilk biscuits with local peach butter and strawberry preserves!'

S'When a drop-dead gorgeous Midsummer Night s Dream theme and fabulous rustic details collide, this is what happens.  Pure, unadulterated pretty, all captured by the ever-amazing Kristin La Voie and set against a mesmerizing ThunderHawk Golf Club setting.  It s basically a fairytale come to life, with a beautiful bride in braids and all sorts of lovely moments scattered throughout the pretty, pretty gallery. Join me there for sooo much more.'
p896
aS'From Kristin La Voie Photography  Our stunning bride Tarah describes the wedding theme as Midsummer Night s Dream with decor full of fairies and butterflies, lace, baby s breath, and rustic outdoorsy elements. The gorgeous mismatched pink bridesmaids dresses, the elegant florals and baby s breath in all the girls  hair, the kissing balls lining the aisle, and the old skeleton keys on all the tables and in the escort table were so thoughtfully made and executed perfectly. I literally felt like I had stepped into a fairytale with the most beautiful and down to earth couple on their wedding day. Tarah was the most stunning bride I have ever seen, and the choice of ThunderHawk Golf club was an excellent choice for this Orange County, CA couple! '

S'Before I even get into how much I love this wedding (and oh, I love this wedding), I just have to say   I love this Bride. Like, adore her. Because anyone that dressed up as a Bride for Halloween at the wee age of five, is a girl after my own heart. So it s no surprise the wedding she has been excited for since she was a little one turned out absolutely stunning, and thanks to the gorgeous images from Ashley Biess Photography, we get to share in all the giddiness right here.'
p989
aS'From the Bride Just like many others, I have been dreaming of this day since I was a little girl   literally   I was a bride for Halloween at 5 years old! So, when my now-husband proposed to me, I couldn t wait to begin planning. Our inspiration behind the overall style of the wedding was a combination of vintage, shabby chic and rustic elements, focusing on pinks, creams, and whites as our colors. We wanted it to be casual, but pretty at the same time. We also incorporated a lot of DIY projects into this day, which I absolutely loved.'
p990
aS'My favorite moment of the evening was standing at the front of the aisle with my (handsome) groom, surrounded by the people we love most in this world. Looking out at them truly made me feel so blessed! And of course, my second favorite moment had to be the mini hot dogs, French fries, and milkshakes brought out as late night snacks!'
p991
aS'My advice to brides is to not doubt yourselves! There were so many times I would become incredibly frantic (sorry Mike!) because I was afraid my ideas we not going to come together as nicely as I planned in my head. On the day of our wedding, after walking into the venue, I couldn t believe I ever questioned myself. Everything turned out more beautifully than I could have imagined and if I could do it all over again, I wouldn t change a thing!\n'

S'I m a little obsessed with Indian weddings. I think they are so beautiful   bright, vibrant, happy, and they usually include a few dress changes, and that s never a bad thing. But this one, from Lang Thomas Photography, might just take the elephant-topped cake. Marti s Floral Designs worked alongside the bride and planner extraordinaire Viva Bella Events to create a wedding that is going to haunt my dreams, in the very best way possible!'
p1047
aS'From the photographer  My husband and I just shot an incredible wedding and it was too good to not send your way. It was unlike any wedding we ve seen before not only was the wedding treated as a joining of two families, but two cultures as well. The bride (from India) and the groom (from Cincinnati) put forth a great effort to stylistically marry their two backgrounds. It played out as an elaborate, colorful wedding, full of amazing food, lots of elephants, beautiful dress, and a memorable ping-pong match.'
p1048
aS'Some of the special touches of the day   sari s worn by bride and several bridesmaids, hand drawn elephant guest book (by the bride), clay elephant cake toppers (by the bride), the henna tattoos on all the bridesmaids, the historic castle and grounds that hosted the ceremony and reception, the literal  tying the knot  Indian custom, unique rings, table settings + floral, and the ping pong match that introduced the bride and groom (they met playing ping pong during their study breaks in med school).'

S'I ve said it a million times before, but this wedding really makes me wish I could be a bride. To get married all over again to the one I love with a wedding that looks Exactly. Like. This. Elegant yet understated, refined yet fun. It s a day that dreams are made of and Laura Ivanova captured every bit. Grab that second round of coffee and join us in the gallery. We ll be there a while.'
p1090
aS'From the Bride  Adam and I met, fell in love, and got engaged in Illinois but moved around to various cities thereafter to support each other s life endeavors. I was finishing up graduate school in Connecticut last year while he was working in New York, and we felt it was time to start planning our wedding before hitting the five-year engagement mark! I ve never been much of a planner, and had to do most of it from afar, after we settled in Savannah, Georgia. Despite the southern charm of Savannah, we wanted to get married in Chicago because our families and many close friends reside there. Everything fell into place after we found our venue, the Armour House in Lake Forest, Illinois. I always envisioned a dreamy outdoor wedding and was blown away by the natural beauty and elegance of the Armour House.'
p1091
aS'The wedding day went by so fast; it really was surreal and a whirlwind. We wanted our celebration to have a sense of drama yet still reflect our laid back personalities. I chose a ball gown with ruffles for the ceremony and Adam looked dashing in his James Bond suit. The ceremony took place outside on the gorgeous lawn of the Armour House. My bridesmaids/best friends looked so beautiful and picturesque in their pastel pink chiffon dresses. I changed into a red dress before the reception because it s Chinese tradition for the bride to wear red. I think it definitely added to the drama when Adam and I were announced and almost fell down the grand staircase to the James Bond theme song. After dinner, we shared our first dance to the song, Home by Edwarde Sharp and the Magnetic Zeroes. This was a very special moment to me because we actually put a lot of time and effort into ballroom dancing lessons, which was a bonding experience in itself. The lyrics  home is wherever I m with you  really captured our journey through many places together.'
p1092
aS'There were so many important people and personal details that made our wedding unique and possible, including support from our parents and relatives from China and Poland, our friend Dave officiating the ceremony, our friend Tom playing the guitar during the ceremony, our friends Dan and Yvonne Heil videotaping the entire day, the wedding party helping out, and all our friends from different parts of the country sharing in our celebration. I was thrilled about the breathtaking roses, hydrangeas, and berries created by Eileen from Lakeforest flowers, and the phenomenal wedding photos from Laura Ivanova. Finally, I m proud of the mini Adam and Sarah cake topper that I made out of clay, which is currently on our fireplace mantle as a reminder of our special day.\n'

S'Yesterday we debuted our second edition of the Fashion & Beauty E-Magazine in all its gorgeous glory and to say this puppy is jam-packed with goodness is a gross understatement. To keep the party going, we thought it would be fun to dive a bit deeper into the 11 real weddings tucked inside its virtual pages. Up first is a Minnesota affair photographed by Emily Steffen with florals and design by Sadies Floral. Honestly, this Bride has one of the most infectiously adorable smiles we ve come across and killer sense of style to boot. Have a look at the full gallery for even more and be sure to flip through the E-Magazine for the full spread.'
p1133
aS'From the Bride  When I started thinking about my dress I didn t know where to start. I had made my own prom dresses in the past because I loved design so much and I love texture in clothing. For my wedding dress I really wanted something that had my design vision in it, including lots of texture. Since my demands were high I thought I would need to make it   but making a wedding dress! That s a lot of work. On a whim I went to the beautiful and beloved store in Edina, Priscilla of Boston. That was it   five dresses later I said yes to my wedding skirt, top and veil. With the help from our awesome consultant at Priscilla I was able to piece it together! The bottom was a very textured   a full but soft chiffon skirt designed by Priscilla of Boston. I knew it was perfect when we matched it together with a Melissa Sweet sweetheart top with vintage crystals and small pearls! And last but not least, my favorite part, a Melissa Sweet long cathedral length veil! My veil did it for me and made me feel like a bride!!! It had lots of texture and detail around the edges. That was it-my dress was complete!'
p1134
aS'My advice to brides would be to not be afraid of texture! Mixing fabrics and textures, and even designers, can get you the exact outcome you want, making you feel like the bride you want to be!!! I also never thought that my wedding dress would be a two-piece, but that made it perfect! Be open to different things   it just might lead you to what you really want!'
p1135
aS'When deciding my color palette I knew that I wanted it to be a mix of very natural colors. I love Shattuck, my venue, and I really wanted the feel and details to enhance Shattuck and add to what was already there! Soft gray blue has always been my favorite color so I knew that was a must, but it s not a very easy color to find. I decided to keep gray blue my focus but included any hue that brought to life the feel I was looking for.'
p1136
aS'For Shattuck s Armory, the reception venue, I always kept in mind the big picture. The space was big, so I really focused on highlighting that fact. There were high ceilings so I showcased the height by bringing in tall curtains that gave the room an awe factor. Too much space can make the room loose an intimate feel, so over the dance floor we hung low twinkle lights. Playing with texture, ceiling level and room ambiance transformed the space from a gym to my dream venue.'
p1137
aS'So many things in my wedding I found by looking off the beaten path!! I always kept my eyes open for things. Most often that is when I found them, in the most random spots! It is easy now to get ideas from places. Keep those ideas in your mind and find things that you can help create your vision and bring life to your ideas.\n'

S'I ve seen a lot of weddings in my day. It comes with the territory of being a wedding blogger. I ve seen it all, and fallen in love over and over again. But this is the first time I m seeing a table suspended from the trees and it s seriously the coolest. White Traditions Bridal House pulled together an inspiration shoot, captured by Todd Studios Photography, centered around the simple, boho bride, and the resulting decor just goes to show how a beautiful gown can fit into a beautiful wedding fabulously.'
p1169
aS'From White Traditions Bridal House  Hidden away this gorgeous Bohemian inspired shoot was done in the heart of Missouri at a beautiful lakeside community called Innsbrook Resort. This lakeside community and gorgeous afternoon sunset provided the perfect backdrop as the August sun cast its warmest hues onto the lush outdoor haven.'
p1170
aS'Created by Worn Vintage Rentals, the table scene was constructed to keep natural elements present by combining the bohemian-chic style with the rustic woodland look   creating a look of romance like no other! Worn Vintage used a vintage door and rope, and suspended it from a tree branch to create a very creative table for the bride. Finished with natural elements from a fallen tree and amber glassware, the table popped with color while still creating an etherial feel. Antique china and repurposed iron wheels brought rustic elements to the table. The floral was done in ivory and bolds, which proved to be perfect opposites to the nature that surrounded the table. Texture was created by meshing all of the looks together into one tabletop.'
p1171
aS'The bride s attire was chosen to be simplistic, yet unique, capturing the very essence of the bohemian culture: not too much fuss involved, simply relaxed beauty. Each of the two gowns (by Eden Bridals and Watters) embodied understated elegance while projecting ease and confidence. The brides hair was left down and wavy, which kept the look simple. Accessories were chosen to add unconventional twists to the simple styles of the dresses. The flower girl wore ivory and blush, and was styled with dramatic hairpieces to emulate the bride s style.'
p1172
aS'Stationery, provided by Todd Studios Photography, was inspired by the outdoor beauty, and adorned in a modern fall palette. Textured paper and painterly florals alluded to the style of the day and paid homage to the serene surroundings. The playful bohemian-style was reinforced with casual script and filigree style.\n'

S'Let s get real for a minute, lovelies, and talk about just how truly awesome this gorgeous Goose Island wedding is.  How the bride is one of the most beautiful ladies you will ever lay your eyes upon, the setting (the oh-so-amazing Gallery 1028) is nothing short of breathtaking and how the neutral color palette and soft candlelight will literally take your breath away. And then when we are done gabbing about all of the crazy gorgeousness, let s spend the rest of the day soaking in every last mesmerizing moment captured by Tim Tab Studios, because it s just that fabulous. Join me in the gallery for more.'
p1219
aS'From the Bride  Bob and I have known each other for ten years and have built our lives together here in Chicago. When we got engaged, we knew we wanted an intimate wedding in Chicago with our closest family and friends. As we put our guest list on paper, we realized that the number of guests was a little larger than we expected. Still, we knew we wanted our wedding to feel like an intimate dinner party   cozy, fun and informal. There was no question it would be a Fall wedding, as it s our absolute favorite season. '
p1220
aS'The first time we saw Gallery 1028, we knew it was a perfect blank pallet for us to be able to create the look and feel of our special day just as we had imagined. It was like a hidden gem in an industrial part of the city. We walked up to what appeared to be a loading dock, but once we were inside the doors, we saw an incredible space with hundred-year-old floors and beams and high ceilings perfect for over-sized chandeliers. I immediately envisioned the entire space filled with candles of all different sizes on the tables, in bunches along the aisle and along a concrete ledge that ran around the main room. We opted for simple, white linens and flowers to contrast the dark wood floors and beams. In the lounge area, we used marble tulip tables, a large white sofa and white chairs for a more modern look, again to contrast with the old building. As a last minute addition, we worked with P.J. at Studio AG to hang strands of cafe lights along the brick wall we would get married in front of. They hung from the beams and pooled on the floor on either side of us, it was such a romantic touch. '
p1221
aS'As for colors, my friends may say I m a bit color-phobic. I much prefer neutrals in varying textures and shades. So, that s what we did. The bridesmaids wore rose gold Trina Turk cocktail dresses we picked up at Bloomingdale s. Most of the decor fell into the white, champagne, ivory range, with little pops of gold here and there. There were feather wreaths hanging from the backs of our chairs, gold, blush and ivory tassel garland above the entry way and a weaved table runner with streaks of gold, blush and ivory from Anthropologie on the entry table. I slowly collected all of these little pieces over the past year.'
p1222
aS'As for the personal touches that made the event more intimate, we opted for gilded cards from Russel and Hazel and asked our guests to leave  Advice and Best Wishes for the new Mr. and Mrs.  instead of a traditional guest book. We had a great time going through these when we returned from our honeymoon! We sipped our signature cocktails (rosemary infused vodka with grapefruit juice and a soda water for me, a classic Manhattan for Bob) out of our gold etched  Mr. and Mrs.  glasses from Furbish, a gift from Bob s sister. We also asked my cousin to officiate the wedding, which was incredibly special. As a late night snack, my aunt baked chocolate chip cookies that guests took to-go in kraft bakery bags that Bob and I stamped with custom stamps from Mae Mae Paperie.'
p1223
aS'We had our first look at the PUBLIC Hotel, a Chicago landmark with great history. We knew we wanted to have a special moment to ourselves before all of the excitement began, and this was a perfect place to do it, as it s one of my favorite spots in the city. Bob s mom surprised us by arranging for our bulldog, Hollywood, to make a surprise appearance for some photos. Seeing Bob before the ceremony put me completely at ease.\n\nWhen we arrived at Gallery 1028, it took my breath away. Everyone told me that the night would go by in a blink, and it really did. It was amazing to see all of the details we d worked on come together, but even more amazing was having all of our friends and family in one place to celebrate with us.'

S'With the raising trend of Gatsby in wedding decor, I ve come to really, really love the Art Deco feel. It s a new favorite for sure, but it wasn t until I saw this modern deco wedding  an updated version of what we would have seen 80 years ago  that I really jumped in with both feet. This bride is a beautiful genius and she rocked her mother s wedding gown (with a few modern updates, of course). Heather Cook Elliott Photography captured the big day that has stolen my heart, never to give it back.'
p1265
aS'From the photographer  Laura & Tom are musicians, or at least were when they met in the band at Northwestern, but it wasn t just a taste for good music that struck me on their wedding day, but rather a taste for good everything. They live and work in Chicago   Tom as an actor and Laura as Jack (Jill) of all trades at a startup   and they love their life in Lincoln Square. So of course they brought some of their new home town sensibility with them when designing their wedding in Laura s home state of Wisconsin. '
p1266
aS'They are old souls and love the nostalgia of eras gone by so they wanted their wedding day to be very much a mixture between old and new, an updated version of what one might have seen at a wedding in the 20s and 30s. Laura wore her mother s wedding gown, redesigned but still reminiscent of her mom s silhouette and their venue   The Wisconsin Club   is a a glorious relic of an older age. Tom sported a pocket watch and all the ladies wore pearls, but hints of modernity struck me, too. Laura s black sash and hints of neon green and purple chevrons peeped out here and there. They further mixed modern sensibility and design with old world charm in everything from the wispy, romantic flowers to nostalgic art deco wedding invitations. '
p1267
aS'The Bridesmaids were dressed in J.Crew chic simplicity and the petite wedding party meandered from the wedding cake architecture of the Wisconsin Club to the grand Church of the Gesu where Laura s cousin presided over their union. In the crisp air of a looming midwestern autumn Laura & Tom headed to the River that reminds them so much of Chicago s great water way and then back to the Club where tables were named for L Stops. More little surprises worth mentioning: Laura embroidered messages to bridesmaids in their gifted clutches and Laura & Tom performed a choreographed first dance (with lifts!) They served tasty cobblers and pies in lieu of cake and they simply did things the way they wanted   in good taste, in good fun, in good everything.\n'

aS'Nick proposed only three months after we met. In sweat pants. So classy. But it s part of our story and only one of the thousand things that makes us   us!'
p1351
aS'First off let me tell you  Nick had fair warning. The other  great love  of my life has been zebra print since I was old enough to recognize it. I always thought I d outgrow the obsession but there I was, 25 years old trying to incorporate zebra into our wedding. How do you plan a wedding that incorporates zebra, coral, puzzle pieces, and all that sparkles? I don t know but somehow we pulled it off! I chose Coral Red Mori Lee Bridesmaids dresses for my girls to break up the black and white-ness of it all. The girls wore zebra shoes and carried zebra clutches. I wore a lush Mori Lee Fit and Flare dress with shards of organza covering the trumpet. For added support and of course added BLING the ladies at the boutique helped me choose a custom beaded belt that was attached as a halter. To carry through the lush feel of my dress I chose Hydrangea bouquets for the girls accompanied by Amsterdam Coral Roses, the stems of which were wrapped in you guessed it! Zebra Print! My custom zebra print black crystal and white pearl shoes were by Marc Defang and I absolutely loved them.'
p1352
aS'We were married by our pastor at Harvest Bible Chapel in Rolling Meadows which has a beautiful little white chapel with stained glass windows. One important aspect of our wedding ceremony was having our Grandmothers as our flower girls which was a big hit! At our reception we had a white fondant cake with zebra print ribbon and sugar flowers with crystal stone centers to tie in the vases that I spent hours working on with nothing but my E6000 and crystals! Tall hydrangea centerpieces filled the reception space and my DIY crystal covered candles lit up the room.'
p1353
aS'My brooch bouquet was a project I started a year before the wedding, collecting brooches, earrings, buttons, you name it! All from our family. I hand tied some crystal ribbon to wrap my bouquet  corset style  to match the back of my dress. I repeated this pattern on a memorial candle at our reception. Nick and I have been calling each other our  puzzle pieces  since we met. This was so important to us to incorporate into our wedding because we believe that God has made us one through marriage. A Complete Puzzle. We had a puzzle guest book that I made and had all of our guests sign. We dressed it up by placing the pieces in crystal boxes we purchased at a craft store. 2 interlocking puzzle pieces topped our wedding cake and perfectly reflected us as man and wife.'

aS'Anna and Albert were married at the bride s parents  resort on picturesque Platte Lake in Honor, Michigan. The rustic aesthetics of the cabins provided a jumping off point for the design combining all things Summer. The cheerful color palate featuring coral, yellow and emerald was accented by the shimmering turquoise waters and warm wood tones in the backdrop.The couple pledged their  I do s  over the water surrounded by family and friends. Following the Ceremony, guests then made their way back onto land for a lively celebration. A small distance away, the tent was set for Dinner. As each person found their seat via the fruit stand display, they were welcomed by a bowl full of ripe, sweet cherries at their place setting. Cascading centerpieces featuring fresh fruit and seasonal blooms embellished the forest surroundings, while the lights draped overhead provided a warm, romantic glow.'
p1408
aS'After dinner, the tunes of the DJ filled the air. Some guests made their way through the motion booth- complete with ever so fitting resort themed props. Others danced the night away overtop the water, the waves crashing ashore. Fun desserts like cherry turnovers, bite sized Morsels and s mores were a sweet ending to a beautiful Northern Michigan Summer wedding day.\n'

aS'Rachel + Adrian s Chicago wedding ended up encompassing everything that they wanted it to: it was filled with love, lots of laughter, and had an elegant Parisian vibe. And to top it all off, it all unfolded against a beautiful urban landscape. I had dreamed about photographing their wedding since the first day I met Rachel and was beaming with excitement all day long. To keep with the urban aspect of the theme I suggested the West Loop as the backdrop for the first look and formal portraits. The guys even made a stop at Au Cheval on Randolph to sip on a gorgeous 12 year old scotch before hamming it up for the camera. The ladies stepped out onto the West Loop streets in their coordinating muted pastel cocktail dresses and Rachel was an absolute dream in her Bettina gown by J.Crew. Her bouquet featured succulents and her grandmother s broach.\n\nRachel + Adrian s first look was one of the more touching I have ever documented and the red doors in the background added an awesome pop of color! The reception and ceremony was held at Fulton s on the River and I cannot say enough about the wonderful staff, especially the event planner Darcey; they made us all feel so welcomed!!\n\nDuring the ceremony a memorial chair sat vacant in the front row, lit by a single candle, commemorating the memory of Rachel s mother. Rachel and Adrian also performed a water ceremony to combine together the two great lakes they had each grew up next to. The ceremony and reception decor was nothing short of perfection and Rachel s Etsy finds, including the vintage key escort cards, accentuated the Parisian theme. The tables were adored with french macaroons, devine florals by Flowerlife, candles and feather plumes; it all paired nicely with the sleek interior at Fulton s on the River.\n\nAs the skyline turned from day to night the urban lights flooding the river and surrounding streets mirrored the flicking candles inside; guests danced to the awesome beats expertly composed by Matt Kuhnen of Style Matters while others smoked cigars and sipped bourbon on the patio along the river. From the LaSalle bridge sounds of laughter could be heard as this beautiful couple began their next stage in life  together.'

S'I know I m not supposed to choose, but fall weddings are my favorite.  I mean, not only do they happen to take place smack-dab in the middle of the world s greatest season (hello football, hot cocoa and comfy sweaters), they are always filled to the brim with those cozy details and vibrant colors I can never get enough of. And when that fall wedding goes hand in hand with a little romantic rainy day drizzle like this beautiful love-filled affair?  Call me smitten.  See it all captured by Autumn and Melinda Photography right here.'

aS'There are few things more beautiful that the leaves of fall in the midwest. Rachel and Dexter planned a colorful wedding around the theme of  FALLing in love.  Every detail, from the bridesmaids Rust (Spice) colored dresses from Jordan, to the spectacular cake from Oak Mill bakery, to the Wishing tree, took advantage of the changing leaves and their amazing color. The only thing they hadn t planned for was a mid-afternoon Chicago storm. This didn t detour either of them, as they grabbed their friends, umbrellas and headed out into the rain. We had some fun with the umbrellas. The rain let up and the result was a gorgeous sky, and the most breathtaking Bride and Groom in a field with a moment left just for themselves.'

S'Confession: Halloween is cool in my book as long as we don t have to watch Hocus Pocus. I saw the movie when a little girl and have been terrified of the Sanderson sisters ever since. However, after coming across this Hocus Pocus inspired shoot from Sequined Silver Lining and Lovestru.ck Weddings & Events, I ve come to the conclusion that I can be on board with Halloween, Hocus Pocus and all, as long as I get this version, from Meghan Savage Photography, of the story. Obsessed might be an understatement.'
p1566
aS'From Lovestru.ck  Natalie and I have worked together for the past few years, and when Natalie asked me to reunite with her (she moved to Kansas City a few months ago) to create a Fall-inspired photo shoot, I jumped at the opportunity to work with her again.'
p1567
aS'We bounced a lot of ideas off each other, but we settled on creating a dark and moody styled shoot. We wanted to design a shoot that was centered on beautiful and inspiring bridal looks with dramatic and mysterious undertones.'
p1568
aS'Natalie and I have styled multiple shoots together, and we ve always discussed wanting to work with a red head, brunette and blonde for models. Luckily, Natalie was able to find three models that fit the bill for this shoot. As I was running outside a few weeks ago and thinking about the changing seasons, I was suddenly inspired to add in elements from my favorite Halloween movie, Hocus Pocus. Using our photographic memory of the movie (like most women our age, watching Hocus Pocus is a yearly tradition) we referenced the Sanderson Sisters  hair, makeup and wardrobe as well as the movie s set design throughout the shoot.'
p1569
aS'Attire:\n For the wardrobe, Natalie pulled gowns that had a hint of color, and we played with using traditional veils as witches  capes. Natalie paired fall accessories such as leather gloves and fur vests with the delicate bridal gowns to give them an edge. We also incorporate an evil eye bracelet into Winifred s look to reference the head witch s infamous one-eyed book.'
p1570
aS'Tablescape/Props:\n The tablescape had to be bewitching but also relatable. I wanted the table to look like something The Sanderson Sisters would put together for a dinner party. We used dark metals, silky velvets, glowing candles and rich copper tones to give it a layered but moody feeling. The table was set for Winifred, Sarah and Mary Sanderson as well as Mr. Thackery Binx   the beloved black cat in Hocus Pocus.'
p1571
aS'Flowers:\n Melissa from Blooms and Bouquets created earthy and dark floral arrangements using red astilbe, burgundy scabiosa, stained pepper berry, cranberry viburnum, passion flower vine, and dark red peonies.'
p1572
aS'Desserts:\n Angela crafted many beautiful and delicious desserts for our shoot. The tablescape featured fluted chocolate cake with chunks of honeycomb and pomegranate. Our dessert display included liege waffles with a thick caramel coating, an extra tall Devil s food cake with chocolate salted caramel buttercream and super dark chocolate chunk cookies.\n'

S'Brunch might just be my favorite time of the day. The food is the best, especially when enjoyed after an early morning walk (or even better, a late morning wake up call). So naturally, brunch weddings are my favorite. They ve got that air of relaxation without anything to stress about. Erin Jean Photography captured a brunch wedding on Lake Michigan (which is a whole other story when it comes to why I love it so much) and, oh my goodness, it s fantastic.'
p1605
aS'From the stunning bride  Chris and I knew from the start that we wanted an intimate wedding. We re both very close with our families, so being able to share and enjoy the memorable day with those closest to us was truly special. Just our parents, siblings, closest friends (one of whom married us!) and of course, our dog Dexter.'
p1606
aS'When selecting the location, Door County, WI was top on our list. Chris  great grandparents built a beach cottage on Lake Michigan in 1929 and his family has been spending summers out there ever since. It s a special spot that we visit every year and we both loved the idea of one day being able to show our children where their parents got married!'
p1607
aS'Since it was a beach wedding, we wanted the dress to be casual. Chris wore a white shirt, khakis and a custom pink dot tie. Phillip, Chris  closest friend who married us, wore a bowtie in the same pattern and our dog matched with his own pink dot tie as well. And since Door County is known for cherries, I thought it would be fun to wear shoes with cherry detail, and was thrilled when I found the Vivienne Westwood Lady Dragon Cherry Heels. They were part of a limited edition collection so was fortunate to find a pair in my size from a woman in London who was selling them on eBay!'
p1608
aS'Ceremony   the morning ceremony took place on the back terrace of the cottage, providing guests with stunning views of the Lake. For d cor, my goal was to incorporate simple accents that showcased us as a couple while allowing the natural beauty of our surroundings to shine. Distressed white stakes with a mix of sheer and satin ribbons created the aisle, French buckets filled with flowers formed the altar and guests sat on benches lined with burlap/lace runners. At each seat, we placed a bubble jar with an antique key (to be used as a bubble wand) and a personal note attached. For the first year of our relationship, Chris would send me an email every morning, each with a new thought about his feelings for me and of our relationship, so on the back of each note was a different  Nice Thought of the Day.  We thought it would be special to incorporate these into various elements of the wedding.'
p1609
aS'To make the ceremony more intimate, Phillip compiled special thoughts about us from all the wedding guests and worked them into the ceremony. We also had a bit of fun by incorporating me and my sister s FAVORITE movie, Sixteen Candles, into the day. At the end of the ceremony, we played If You Were Here by The Thompson Twins. We timed it so that the words of the song started right when we kissed. The surprise on my sisters face was priceless, I heard her gasp in excitement!'
p1610
aS'Brunch   after the ceremony, a trolley took us to Horseshoe Bay Golf Club for brunch. We sat outside, our table overlooking the water and wooded cliffs. We placed a burlap/lace runner and bud vases filled with ranunculus down the center of the table, and pre-set personalized menus so that they also acted as seating cards. Similar to the bubble jars, each menu had a different  Nice Thought of the Day  on the backside.'
p1611
aS'The Club allowed us to create our own menu (they were so wonderful to work with!), so we incorporated specialties from both families. We placed jars of Chris  Mom s infamous cherry preserves on the table; each branded with  Susie s Homemade Cherry Preserves  labels, and my Moms famous  Beach Granola,  served with milk and fresh fruit, was a choice on the menu. We toasted with cherry mimosas and in lieu of cutting a wedding cake, we bit into a tower of cake donuts.'
p1612
aS'If I had to give any advice, it would be to make sure that the day reflects you as a couple. Pick songs, choose desserts, set a location, etc. that feels right to you. Because at the end of the day, that s what the celebration is all about, the TWO OF YOU.\n'

A wedding, lovelies, that happens to combine an uber-awesome outdoor ceremony with a sophisticated meets elegant reception in a ballroom sort of overflowing with pretty.  Think gorgeous pink hues, a stunning bride and groom and a whole host of lovely moments captured by Kina Wicks Photography.  Add in a little romance via nature s gift, aka, the rain and we have ourselves one entire day of amazing.  See it all in the full gallery.'

aS'From Kina Wicks  Haley and Clayton both have midwest roots with California wings. They decided to come back to Chicago to celebrate their wedding, and did it with a bang! Their classy and sophisticated style was showcased at their venue at Piper Hall at Loyola University. The lake view paired with the classic style of Piper Hall allowed Haley and Clayton to have a wonderful wedding day, even despite the pouring rain! This couple, so focused on the real meaning of the day, pulled off the change of plans without a hitch! Their positive spirits, love for each other, and general easy going attitudes helped us all relax and sit back in amazement. It was their ability to weather the storm that hit them that day that lets us know that their marriage will be able to handle any other storms that come their way.'

S'A natural, green as can be setting can far outweigh any amount of man-made fanfare. Just have a look at this outdoor wedding captured by Geneoh for proof. Of course, not all of us are lucky enough to have a forrest canopy at our fingertips but taking a few cues from the styling of Munster Rose and you can add the look and feel of a wedding gone au naturel to your big day. Sometimes all it takes is wood accents and greenery wherever you can tuck it. Have a look here for more.'
p1729
aS'From the Bride  While in the midst our wedding planning, a wise friend told me,  The intangibles make the occasion.  This is certainly true; it is the moments, the careful thoughtfulness of the details, and the shared memories that I remember the most about our wedding day.'
p1730
aS'If I were to use 5 words to describe our wedding it would be,  togetherness , intimate, natural, elegant, and simple. Wessel and I are simple people who value family, friends, our faith, simple beauty, and of course, each other. Thus, we tried to find a venue that was suitable for a small intimate wedding of our closest friends and family. This was tricky, as Wessel is from South Africa and I am from Minnesota, oceans apart. Even more, we both wanted all of our relatives and friends to be able to attend, but alas, we had to choose, and we decided on the Smith Douglas Moore House. The Smith Douglas Moore House was built in 1877 (we have a  thing  for the number 7), which has so beautifully been renovated into a coffee shop that maintains the charm of the 1800 s. The house had a large tree covered backyard, which we lined with wooden chairs and tables for both the ceremony and the reception, and we kept the inside of the house as a back-up for rain, and a mingling center during our cocktail hour. Note the future brides: always have a rain plan. We lucked out with beautiful weather, but I cannot tell you how many weddings get rained out, with brides that highly regret not making a successful rain plan.'
p1731
aS'Now, Wessel and I won the wedding lottery when we found out we were able to work with a group of amazing and talented individuals through the Midwest Wedding Project. It is beyond words how talented our these people are (as you can see from the photographs that Gene Pease of Geneoh Photography captured so eloquently.) Lizie of Lizie Anne Weddings and Proposals, was an absolute angel as our wedding planner, alongside the styling and floral design of miss Jackie at Munster Rose. I never knew how much help a wedding planner and florist/stylist could be, with their knowledge of vendors, itineraries, layout design etc. It turned my hypothetical dream board into a reality of soft white peony blooms, garlands, wooden accents, candles, and botanicals. Words can t describe the work of these two. We also had the privilege of working with Harrison Collective on the invitations and programs, which literally made me squeal and cry when I first saw the designs. Brandon managed to capture our personality and style with the simple elegance we love, and a hint of our nautical wandering selves. Not to mention, the tied rosemary on the programs that made my heart so happy. Wessel and I wanted to include objects that tell stories, like the green glass candy dish that my grandmother handed down to me, and the wood burl table that my parents made from the wood of a redwood tree, our favorite family-made desserts, half log seating chart (courtesy of my cousins, brother-in-law and sister-in-law), and the wood burned sign, remembering all those that could not be with us on that special day. The final ambience was  besonders  (Afrikaans roughly translated: unbelievably beautiful and special.)'
p1732
aS'Then there was the day. Everything was perfect, as I walked on the arm of my dad and met Wessel under the trees. We cried and we laughed, and I tell you, that moment, holding his hands, and seeing his eyes, is what marriage is about. The other details are added blessings.'
p1733
aS'From the Vendors  Kate and Wessel were part of The Midwest Wedding Project. This project was created by local MN artists who wanted to give-back to the community and bless one lucky couple with their dream wedding. After hearing the modern-day love story of this Minnesota native and her South African fiance, we KNEW Kate and Wessel were the perfect couple for this Project. (Geneoh, Lizie Anne, Munster Rose and Harrison Collective are the founding members of the Midwest Wedding Project.)\n'

They just seem to have this fabulous layer of chic added to everything single moment of the big day, and this one planned by Tiffany of Soiree Weddings & Events is no different. It s elegant, filled with stunning florals from Exquisite Designs and packed with personal touches   and it s all waiting for you right here.'

aS'Fast forward four years to our engagement which was a complete surprise to me! Jeremy arranged my days off of work and whisked me off to a romantic weekend at the Esperanza Resort in Cabo San Lucas. He planned a private dinner on the beach where he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.'
p1790
aS'For our wedding we considered many different locations, even our current home of Los Angeles but we soon realized that we could only get married in Chicago. Chicago is where we met, where our families still live and the city that will always be our home. When we started planning the wedding we planned our must have list; an intimate wedding, great music and an amazing dinner. I figured that it would be so easy to plan a wedding from Los Angeles, was I wrong. When a day of wedding appointments was all but ruined by flight cancellations and delays because of fog, we landed with enough time to make one appointment. Arriving at 7pm on Thanksgiving Eve, almost 5 hours late we were able to taste the most amazing food prepared by the team at Boutique Bites. We booked with them that night and luckily I was able to find equally awesome vendors and a wedding planner to help me design our wedding.'
p1791
aS'This all started with the venue, we knew that we wanted a space to make our own. When we visited Room 1520 I was able to see that the blank canvas and beautiful chandeliers would be the perfect location for our wedding, even though Jeremy couldn t! I told him to trust me, that this place would be amazing! For the design I really wanted to do modern wedding with a very romantic feel. To do this I chose blush, black and gold as the wedding colors and incorporated a lot of mercury glass. One of the items that really made the space were the flowers which consisted of white hydrangeas, white roses and cafe au lait dahlias in mercury glass footed bowls. With the help of a great florist I was able to get the flowers that I envisioned without going over budget.'
p1792
aS'The most enjoyable part of wedding planning was to make our day as personal as possible and incorporate our bulldogs. To do that I spent countless hours melting wax to make soy scented candles for wedding favors and designing our wedding programs that included a picture of our two bulldogs, Capone and Bugsy. And one of the most meaningful projects was cutting yards of tulle to make dresses for my three nieces that were part of the wedding party as the two flower princesses and ring princess. My countless list of projects and planning an unforgettable honeymoon in South Africa were only made possible by my wonderful fianc  ordering many nights of takeout!\n'

S'One of my most favorite possessions as a kid was my rainbow bright doll and that love affair with colorful objects clearly carried on into my adult years because I can t seem to get enough of this wedding. It s an explosion of colorful details and whimsical snapshots made all the more fun and heartfelt at the hands of Jordan Brittley s photographs. Have a look for yourself right here in the full gallery of images.'
p1835
aS'From the Bride  Our wedding venue was a pretty easy pick, because it was my home church. I wanted to celebrate our special day in a place that was important to me. For our guest book, we had our guests sign their names using a bottle of paint. We had this done on canvas so that they became a work of art we could display in our house!'
p1836
aS'I really wanted our wedding reception to be semi-informal, comfortable and FUN. The stage was a spot to have the wedding party sit where they d stand out from the rest. For our first look, we were each holding a bouquet of balloons and released them once we were in front of each other. This day was all about happy, and I think balloons totally give off that vibe! It was exciting to have a moment together before the craziness of the wedding ceremony and reception began! I. love. color. I get SO much joy from seeing bright colors together, so I knew for sure that s what I wanted the wedding colors to be. It took a painstakingly long time to get those colors in that order perfect.'
p1837
aS'My favorite part of the day, was really the day itself. It s something I longingly looked forward to for so long. But even more than that day all the days after because I m living life with my best friend. I also really cherished the message our pastor gave   encouraging us,  as iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.  He gave us a hands-on analogy with some pruning sheers and a sharpener   it was a great visual.\n'

S'This Starved Rock State Park wedding is easy to love for a lot of reasons, but standing tall and proud above the rest?  The bride and groom, two adorable sweethearts who happen to be smiling with pure, unadulterated joy in each and every image.  I m talking the kind of love that literally bursts from your computer screen, people.  It s awesome.  And when you pair all of that happiness with a gallery of pretty captured by Laura Fisher Photography, it s a guaranteed day of swooning.  Join me there for more.'
p1937
aS'From Laura Fisher Photography  A cool summer s day, crisp and fresh after a spell of rain, set the air for Heather and Tammer s quiet, bespoke forest wedding at Starved Rock State Park & Trails. Married beneath the giant pines, Tammer and Heather (or as they like to collectively call themselves now that they re married  Tethered ) celebrated their big day with natural touches abound: herbal boutonnieres, flowered bridesmaid frocks, spice jar favors for the guests, and lavender blossoms for throwing during the recessional. The reception at Starved Rock Lodge ended the night on a cozy note, with wine and lavender buttercream cake in front of the giant fireplace in the main hall of the Lodge. '
p1938
aS'For this San Francisco couple, it s no wonder they were drawn to get married in the one corner of Illinois that looks like you ve been magically transported to the mountain woodlands of Northern California! '
p1939
aS'From the Bride  We met when we were sophomores in high school, dated for two weeks, broke up, and then began a year long battle of Tammer trying to win me back. At times we were speaking daily (lots of international calls!), and at other times not speaking at all. When my long term relationship fell apart, I moved back into my parents  home outside Sacramento, and Tammer coincidentally moved to SF. It was magic from then on!'
p1940
aS'The inspiration behind our day was the location  Starved Rock State Park. It was the centerpiece of our wedding, because it was a place that we had visited when we first met in high school. It holds lots of memories for us. I wanted to incorporate herbs and spices into the ceremony and reception as much as possible, to fit with the natural setting and, well, cooking is kinda my thing.'
p1941
aS'For wedding favors we bought many different kinds of herbs in bulk from Penzey s coriander, aleppo, thyme, tarragon, you name it. We ordered spice jars with cork lids online and had a designer on Etsy create the labels. I had a favor-making party with my bridal party to get all the jars filled!'

S'Want to ensure a day that is literally dripping with romance?  Hold your wedding at the beautiful Murphy Auditorium in downtown Chicago, just like these two cuties did.  Because this wedding? This dreamland of Parisian-inspired details and beautiful blush hues?  It s wonderful.  And it s just the kind of affair that I know you are all dreaming of.  So, sit back, relax and prepare to soak in every last amazing moment captured by Cristina G Photography.  You won t regret a single second.'
p1991
aS'From the Bride  The easiest decision of the entire wedding planning process was our first (after deciding to get married, of course!). We walked into The Murphy, the first venue we looked at, and booked it on the spot. The ornate Parisian cathedral style blew us away, and it became the inspiration for our wedding. The style, as we defined it, was  Midnight in Paris/Van Gogh s Starry Night.  For florals, we went with soft, romantic colors such as white, peach, and pink, with dusty miller accents. To add to the ambiance we also chose amber uplighting around the perimeter and tall candelabras for the center tables to fill the space and draw our guests  eyes up towards the gorgeous ceiling. '
p1992
aS'Our food also had French accents   from the chicken confit appetizer to our espresso creme brulee cups for passed late night snacks. Music during cocktail hour and dinner was French cafe-inspired, including many Django Reinhardt jazz pieces. And finally, to add to the formal, romantic mood, we chose black tuxedos for the men, and I chose a lace Liancarlo dress and pearl accessories. We couldn t have been happier with how the event turned out and were able to enjoy all of the romance we had worked so hard to create!'

S'To be honest, I feel like I ve been living under a rock having NOT yet seen a full episode of Downton Abbey. Don t get me wrong   I get the gist, but when amazing vendors like Stacy Able and Jama Finney start planning entire shoots around the show, you know you re a officially out of the TV loop. Soooo, besides binge watching the last four seasons to play catch up, my week will be spent curled up in this gorgeous gallery of Downton-style pretty. Find it all here.'
p2037
aS'From Stacy Able  This wedding inspiration shoot took place on a rainy afternoon at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is proof you can pull together a sophisticated event just about anywhere even during Indiana s infamous unpredictable weather. Stacy Able Photography, Detail + Design, and Cake Zen came up with the concept of the shoot. Inspiration was taken from Downton Abbey and Great Gatsby with a color palette of emerald green, gold, mints, blush, and ivory. The palette blended seamlessly with the 1920 s style gowns from Blue House Bridal and the classic tux from DC s Tux.'
p2038
aS'The goal of this shoot was to reflect old world elegance in a clean, classic, and timeless way. To achieve that look, Stacy Able shot a majority of the images with medium formal film. Then by adding touches of elegance with vintage china, soft peach and pink florals, and gold jewelry from Gthrapp the end result was a modern wedding with touches of old world charm and sophistication. Fresh white Peonies from Claudia s Florabunda and roses from Detail and Design formed a glamorous feel to the table, along with the heirloom lace linens and crystal. The chairs and centerpieces helped to pull the scene together, along with the many handmade desserts and open face sandwiches. '
p2039
aS'The invitations by Posh and Polish were the definition of vintage chic, utilizing floral details and elegant fonts topped off with lettering by Calligraphy with TLC. Modern studded Valentinos from Indianapolis s Saks Fifth Avenue were utilized to give a tiny touch of mystery and opulence. The emerald wedding ring and heirloom gold jewelry pieces paid homage to the pantone color of the year and added the touch of sparkle every bride dreams of. This elegant shoot came together marvelously due to the synergy of Indianapolis finest wedding vendors.'

S'I adore the couple who stands the test of time before they even set one foot down the aisle. It s just such a testament to the love that they will have as a married couple. Today we ve got all that and a gorgeous wedding to boot! Both Kortnee Kate Photography and Voila Cinematic were on the scene of this beautiful wedding and we re kind of obsessed.'
p2070
aS'When we heard Voila Cinematic had a video to share, we couldn t say yes quickly enough!'
p2071
aS'From the beautiful bride  Gene and I started dating in high school and continued dating long distance all through college. He proposed at the end of his second year of medical school, after I had just finished my Masters finals. We set a date of April 6, 2013, just after he matched to a residency program, giving us a two year engagement. It was so much fun to relax and enjoy being engaged for a whole year before really starting to plan a wedding.'
p2072
aS' From the start, we wanted a wedding that would honor our love for each other but also celebrate the love we have for our incredible family and friends. We also wanted to incorporate elements of our Cincinnati hometown, New England life, and future life in Durham, North Carolina (he matched to Duke, his #1 choice!). The ceremony, music, and service was the time for us to let the busyness of the day come to an end and officially become husband and wife. The cocktail hour and reception were our way of saying thank you to our guests for being such big parts of our lives.'
p2073
aS' Since we had been to many events at this country club, the little details made all the difference for us. We chose bright coral bridesmaids dresses (we, because Gene went with us!), white with French blue paper goods, and a really fun, local live band. Our E&E wedding logo, signature Mint Juleps (we got engaged on Derby Day), photo booth, and stunning flowers transformed the space into the perfect night for our guests to have a great time.'
p2074
aS' Were a very traditional couple, so a few family traditions were especially special to us. We used a cake knife from Genes family that matched the set of sterling left to us by his late grandmother. My bouquet was covered in the same ribbon as my cousins was five years before, wrapped in my grandmothers lace handkerchief, and decorated with some of my late Papa s pins. When I picked up the bouquet for the first time, I felt surrounded by so much family love.'
p2075
aS' Though very traditional, we did decide to do a first look  one of our most favorite moments of the day. At first we were worried it would take away from the ceremony, but instead it gave us the time to enjoy a very emotional moment to ourselves, one that was perfectly captured by Voila Cinematic and Kortnee of Kortnee Kate Photography. They are both such incredible vendors, I cant rave enough about how they kept us laughing the whole day! My bridesmaids and cousin Jocelyn (our volunteer weekend-of coordinator) kept the whole day running smoothly behind the scenes   something I m incredibly grateful for, since we planned the whole day ourselves.'
p2076
aS' Even given the two year notice about the date, we were astounded by how many of our guests took time to travel to Ohio for our wedding   242 out of 250 invited guests from all over the world. Walking down the aisle with my Dad towards my soon-to-be husband, in room full of everyone we ve both grown up with and love, was a really incredible (and emotional!) feeling. Dancing the night away to Jack Garrett s music was such a blast, and kept guests of all ages out on the dance floor all night long. We were certainly blessed on that day and are so grateful that is how we started our married life together.'

S'There comes a point in my day when it s time to shut down the computer, put away the pretty for another day, and step back into the real world. That point was just after I opened up this wedding. And here I am, hours later, still pouring over every beautiful image from m three studio. I was drawn in by a beautiful wedding and held captive by a relationship worthy of hours and hours (or perhaps days) of my time.'
p2107
aS'From the beautiful bride  Many brides hire a wedding coordinator to help through all the details of planning a wedding. I had my mother. She was just as excited as I was from start to finish. From helping with picking vendors to organizing all the little details that can so easily be forgotten by a busy bride, my mom ensured everything went smoothly up through the day of the wedding.'
p2108
aS'We had talked about an outside ceremony but the risk of bad weather and needing to have a plan B was something that held me back. The moment Kevin and I walked into the Patrick Haley Mansion in Joliet, IL, we knew right away this was the place we wanted the wedding. Built in 1889, the mansion had a timeless beauty yet had the most elegant ballroom with oversized windows and French doors on every side that opened to the spectacular grounds. The ballroom had a fabric draped ceiling, large chandeliers and gold accents throughout its d cor. The linens were ivory and I choose to add gold flowing sashes on the back of each chair, which brought out the gold in the room and matched the edging on the china place settings. The ballroom opened directly to the back of the mansion to a paved patio with an aisle that took you down to a large white pergola with a hanging chandelier surrounded by flowering plants, trees and running water ponds on either side. What a perfect location for an outdoor wedding and if the weather didn t cooperate the ceremony can be set up in the ballroom.'
p2109
aS'There is such natural beauty at the venue that there wasn t a need for too many flowers. We decided to have Karen our florist attach a long tulle bow on the aisle chairs and line the aisle with a thick row of fresh rose petals that matched the flowers in my bouquet, ivory, blush & a touch of lavender. I loved the elegance of the ballroom as it was and I wanted to keep the centerpieces on the tables simple. Karen was great in helping me decide on a combination of blush rose heads in a small bubble vase filled with crystals alternating with floating tea candles.'
p2110
aS'My mother in law has such a talent with any DIY project. She helped with all these details from the antique key place cards, the invitations, card box etc.'
p2111
aS'Inspired by the venue we decided to have a string quartet play classical music for our wedding. Artistrings played beautifully and just added to the atmosphere and timeless elegance of our surroundings.'
p2112
aS'Many brides have a certain aspect of the wedding that is most important to them. My top priority was the photography. I wasn t looking for just another photographer to take posed pictures, but someone that will capture the moments in a style and creativity. I found Molly from m three studio. She and her assistant did such an incredible job and were so fun to work with. One of my favorite moments of the entire day was taking the bride & groom pictures. Molly has a gift for bringing out natural moments for each picture and making it fun while doing so.'
p2113
aS'There were so many memorable moments throughout my wedding day from the excitement of getting ready at the mansion to the anticipation of the start of the ceremony. It was a beautiful sunny day perfect for an outdoor wedding. The time has come for it all to begin. As the string quartet played Mothers Boughs Cannon my dad walked me down the aisle to marry my best friend. Some might say a bride should expect something to go wrong on her wedding day but I can say that my wedding turned out perfect. Everything was exactly as I had imagined and hoped for. I wouldn t have changed a thing.\n'

S'You know what really tickles my fancy? Weddings like this one by Cristina G Photography. Why, you ask? Well, it s the way it seems to effortlessly combine an intimate yet glamourous feel all in a single night. Sprinkle in a whole lot of love, and this, my pretties, is a wedding worthy of your favorites folder. See why here.'
p2160
aS'We wanted to create a fairytale wedding that was a combination of both a big city celebration yet still held an intimate, personalized vibe. I brought an outdoor wedding indoors with carefully chosen and vibrantly-colored wildflowers and succulents, fresh yellow lemons, and glass mason jars adorning the round tables draped in celadon greens and buttercup hues. The window ledges of the room were lined with glowing candles as large paper lanterns of green, orange, and yellow hung confidently from the domed ceiling, illuminating the dance floor and adding a unique and beautifully choreographed effect.\n\nI purposefully added some personal touches by hand-making name cards with gold-embossed stamping and handwritten names. I painted vases and had guests write advice in each for my husband and I to read on our one, five, ten, and twenty year anniversaries. After a gorgeous ceremony at the amazing Holy Family Church, my hand-beaded Lazaro gown withstood an evening of dancing with our genuinely-happy family and friends. All of the hard work put into each and every detail of the day paid off when I saw the room for the very first time and broke down into tears of joy. The Great Hall of Cafe Brauer had been transformed into the most beautiful place I had ever seen   and the perfect place to begin a new life of blissful friendship and never-ending love.\n'

S'Wisconsin, you re doing it right. I don t know what s in the water up there, but every wedding I see from American s Dairyland is as pretty as pretty can be. Take this particularly happy one from La De Da Photography. Ridiculously beautiful decor, which just so happened to be pretty much all DIY, donuts and macarons for dessert, horses and a stunning barn  and a couple that is straight out of a magazine. All in all, as perfect as a wedding can be.'
p2204
aS'From the beautiful bride  When Peter and I made our first visit to The Enchanted Barn we knew immediately that it was the perfect place for us. An 1800 s barn that had it s original rustic charm, but with updates to accommodate our modern day needs. I spent a year on Pinterest getting inspired and really discovering what our wedding vibe would be; a rustic romantic soiree with delicious eats and drinks in a relaxed social setting   and the best dance party our guests had ever been to.'
p2205
aS'The ceremony was short and sweet with lots of laughs and smiles. Neither of us are particularly religious, so to keep our ceremony meaningful and special we had Peter s dad marry us. Close family did witty readings that we had chose for them focusing on long lasting love and the realness of marriage. My dad read Corinthians 1: Love is Patient, which he chose himself and spoke to our beliefs.'
p2206
aS'Peter was very adamant that we serve good comfort food and I didn t want a traditional sit down dinner. So we decided to serve a variety of heavy appetizers including turkey legs and bacon skewers. We kept our bar list simple with beer, wine, prosecco, and two signature drinks (that spoke true to us). Our dessert table was a wide spread of all delicious sweets including a crowd favorite, donuts from Baker s wife and my must, french macarons from Patisserie 46.'
p2207
aS'The grounds at the barn naturally had a beautiful ambiance that involved horses in the grass fields, a bonfire with benches set around it, and three patios with bistro tables and outdoor furniture. We also set up some lawn games for those who wanted to avoid the blaring music inside. The dance began with our DJ playing music from our play list and to our surprise his skills were a 10. He mixed all of our favorite dance tunes, which exceeded our expectations of the standard wedding DJ. I also brought hula hoops which were a big hit on the dance floor the entire night.'
p2208
aS'The decor was DIY, DIY, DIY. Let s just say I was a Joann Fabrics regular. Being a Pinterest addict, I found so many great links and ideas for all my decor. My most proud creation was my lighted signs (  A + P  and  CHEERS  hung above the bar)  made with paper mache letters, spray paint, hot glue gun, and string lights.'
p2209
aS' Peter s personal touch (and surprise gift to me) was a hand made wood bench he built. We brought it to the barn and set it up with Sharpies to have our guests sign their names and personal messages to us (our version of a guest book).'
p2210
aS'All and all the day was 100% true to us and we wouldn t have done it any different. I can t express the level of happiness I felt on that day, and I now completely understand the wedding hype. Growing up I never thought that I d be a traditional bride with a 200 person wedding, but it was truly the best day of my life. I d happily do it a hundred times over again.\n'

S'Sweet, sweet, sweet is the theme of this backyard wedding. It s paired down to the beautiful basics. A Bride and Groom, a simple celebration surrounded by loved ones and a good helping of pie. And by pie, we re talking a whole pie bar. Genius! Jordan Brittley captured the day, every last ribbon filled moment of it,  and you can see even more right here in the full gallery.'
p2304
aS'From the Bride  I really wanted an outdoor wedding with a beautiful landscape to enjoy. Our venue was on family land and I just loved overlooking the double ponds. During our reception we didn t want to do a dinner so we decided on a pie bar. All of the pies were created by my sweet aunts. This was a very delicious way to get my family involved in our special day.'
p2305
aS'I wanted the bouquets to be simple and elegant so I chose white hydrangea blooms and coral colored ger-minis (which are miniature gerber daisies). I walked out of the house and Adam was waiting for me under the trees overlooking the beautiful double ponds. He looked so handsome in his tux. I sneaked up behind him and covered his eyes. When he turned around the smile that spread across his face can only be described as breathtaking. The intimacy of a smaller wedding allowed us to enjoy our special day with each of our guests. Family is very important to the both of us and we really wanted each of my nieces and nephews to share a part of our day. The small gathering allowed the children to run and play and enjoy the time with each other.'
p2306
aS'The whole day was perfect. We had a scare with the weather the whole week before our wedding. The weather turned out to be perfect with a blue sky and 80 degrees. We had to rush to get decorations put up that morning but with the help of family and friends every thing came together beautifully.'
p2307
aS'I loved the first dance with my husband and the father/daughter dance. The dances gave us time away from the busyness of the day to just spend a few minutes whispering and giggling together. The father/daughter dance was very emotional but it allowed me to be daddy s little girl for a little while longer.\n'

S'When a garden affair is on the agenda, my day is made. And today s soiree just so happens to be a garden affair complete with barn, ring bearer in seersucker, and pretty amazing light, captured so brilliantly by Kristin La Voie Photography. And the love at the center? Blog worthy, to say the least.'
p2353
aS'From the photographer  This is a stunning rustic barn wedding at Byron Colby Barn, just outside Chicago. Nestled between fields and charming homes, this venue is one of my favorite hidden gems in the suburbs. The barn was completely transformed into a gorgeous affair fit for a queen with Forget Me Knot s amazing florals on every table, the perfect Loveseat placed at the sweetheart table, and the adorable trees strung with lights and doves. Not to mention, the most adorable ring bearer on the planet, Michael (Joe & Diana s son) was dressed in the cutest seersucker suit and bow tie. The bridesmaids all wore the most unique dresses I ve ever seen (which the bride found on Etsy). It was a perfectly sweet garden affair!\n'

S'Have I mentioned just how much I adore a traditional Chicago affair?  Because, I so, so, sooo do.  There s just something about classically elegant details paired with a fabulous Windy City backdrop that makes my heart pitter patter, and when it s an oh-so-sophisticated day like this one captured by Stacy Able, there s really no describing my excitement.  From the beautiful florals from Ashland Addison Floral to the crazy cool Public Hotel backdrop to the fab paper goods from Minted, I m calling this the epitome of perfection.  See so much more right here.'
p2398
aS'From the Bride  We chose the Public Hotel first because it used to be the old Ambassador East, home of the historic Pump Room, and has been re-imagined by hotelier Ian Schrager. When my Nana was a stewardess and living in Chicago many years ago she actually lived in the Ambassador East, so the hotel holds a lot of meaning for our family. Once we saw it s new design we were sold.'
p2399
aS'When the day came, it was a wonderful feeling. We woke up, had coffee and breakfast with the bridesmaids and got started on hair and makeup. It was a very calm morning, which is exactly what I imagined. Our suite at Public was beautiful and we were just enjoying the morning and each others  company. We opened a few bottles of champagne and once everyone started getting dressed we were really excited to get the night started! The Public Hotel has a beautiful terrace overlooking the city, so we were glad to use that as the backdrop for some of our pictures.'

S'Warning: Your jaw may hit your desk when you scroll through all the pretty below. Because this wedding from Heather Parker Photography? It s dripping with gorgeous. It s the type of wedding that feels like a fairytale, complete with a reception worthy of your wildest wedding dreams. It s image after image of pure perfection, and you can see it all right here.'

aS'Gorgeous, no? Well it just keeps getting better with this film from I Do Films '
p2473
aS'From the Bride  Greg and I met at a summer barbecue at the home of a mutual friend. Prior to the barbeque, our friend (and future bridesmaid) told me terrible things about all of the single men that would be at the party except for Greg, who she said was incredibly smart, funny and kind. She made the same types of comments to Greg about me and the single women at the party. While she thought she was cleverly stacking the deck in favor of us getting together, it wasn t necessary. We hit it off instantly, bonding over shared interests such as European travel, history, museums and over-the-top desserts.'
p2474
aS'Two years later, Greg proposed in our home. After following a trail of candles, I arrived in a room filled with more candles and hydrangeas, my favorite flower. Greg, wearing the same outfit he wore to our friend s barbeque, asked me to marry him and I said yes!'
p2475
aS'Initially, we wanted a very autumn-themed wedding with a warm palette of peach, pink and gold. Caf  Brauer, a turn of the century building with a warm brick interior and views over a pond (where fall leaves could be seen from the windows) was the perfect reception location. However, after falling in love with bridesmaid dresses in a very Marie Antoinette shade of blue, our design inspiration changed. We incorporated crystal chandeliers decorated with flowers, elongated gold pedestals for flowers, a relief motif in the invitations, a French dessert buffet with a croquembouche, macarons, eclairs, tartlets, etc. and little packages of fruit pate for favors. Due to an outstanding team of vendors, the wedding turned out beautifully and just as we hoped it would. In retrospect, our decision to move away from an autumn-themed wedding was serendipitous, as the leaves had not yet changed, and the unseasonably warm weather that day made it feel like a summer wedding.\n\nLooking back, our most cherished memory from the wedding day was of us at the altar, exchanging our vows before our family and friends. It meant so much to us that everyone we loved was there to witness our lifelong commitment to each other and to share our special day.\n'

S'I hope you re in the mood to get happy, because unless you click out of SMP right this very second, it s happening. You can thank K. Holly Photography and her absolutely adorable couple for that. Their love and laughter is infectious and they are the kind of fun couple that I m sure everyone just adores!'
p2517
aS'From the photographer  Allie and Dan had an incredible wedding day, the kind that most brides (and grooms!) dream of. The weather was phenomenal, the timeline was well thought out, the lush modern details were impeccable, and everyone was relaxed, excited and ready for a great time. The day was filled with love, friends, and family. Joy, happiness, and a little silliness. There is no one like Allie and Dan! They are beautiful inside and out. They both have huge hearts and a playful and positive outlook on life. It has been such a pleasure getting to know them, and we are excited for what their future holds!'
p2518
aS'The couple got ready and saw each other for the first time at a private residence on the Thornapple River. The Grand Rapids Trolley company took them to Park Congregational where they said their vows. From there, it was off to the JW Marriott downtown Grand Rapids for a celebration with live band Rumplestiltskin!\n'

But really, with Michelle Durpetti Events behind it, how could it not? It s class and elegance all set in a gorgeous barn venue and like I said, it s an instant favorite!'
p2570
aS'From the photographer  Kate and Greg are all sunshine. They were married at Orchard Ridge farms, but this is no ordinary farm wedding. This was a formal affair in a gorgeous rural setting.'
p2571
aS'The first moment we arrived at Kate s house, the bride took us aside and said something to the effect; I love the work you do, just do what you do best, that s why I hired you. So with that, we did! It is so wonderful to have the trust of a couple right at the start. Verbal permission to follow our artistic eye, and to not let anything hinder that, pushed us to make these wonderful images we are so proud of.'
p2572
aS'We met Kate at her family farm in Rockford for getting ready. The ceremony was at St. Anthony of Padua church also in Rockford. A bit of rain on the way to Orchard Ridge Farms had us worrying about portraits. Of course, the second Kate and Greg arrived, the clouds parted to reveal a beautiful day. It was perfect for exploring the idyllic grounds. Kate took off her shoes, Greg danced and we watched the loving fun of this couple through our lenses.'
p2573
aS'As the sun set on the day, everyone gathered outside to watch the sky. With this landscape and light we just had to get lovely portraits of the guests. The gorgeous barn interior of Orchard Ridge Farms was filled with the prettiest floral arrangements by Elizabeth Wray Design. After dark, the dancing began. Gold Coast All Stars kept the dance floor filled all night long. The entire day was seamless thanks to Michelle Durpetti Events.'

The other genius part of this day is the uber sweet, totally love-filled picnic wedding complete with blankets in the grass and peach favors from The Peach Truck. It s beautiful and the photographs from Lily Glass are guaranteed to leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Grab a looky loo at the rest of the day here.'
p2616
aS'From Lily Glass Photography  I had the pleasure of photographing Arthur + Reika Kadlec s simple yet stunning summer wedding. They were married during an intimate family ceremony in an old stone chapel in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, on June 8th with a picnic reception at Art s childhood home to follow. Reika s dress was a labor of love as she searched for the perfect style, finally creating one herself pairing a short lace dress from Madewell with a custom-made sheer skirt.'
p2617
aS'Every detail of their wedding day was meaningful and intentional   from the vintage china to grandma s linens, to the juicy delicious peach favors their friends from The Peach Truck brought up from Nashville, to their choosing a caterer that provides not only delicious food but also social justice (Freedom a la cart).'
p2618
aS'Art and Reika have such a sincere love that encourages and sharpens those with whom they come into contact   their love makes you want to love better, to love genuinely. And so it was no surprise that their wedding was a celebration to begin their lives together, but also a downright party during which they danced and hugged and high-fived the friends and family that they hold so dear. There were folks from all over the world and never have I seen wedding guests intermingle so well as this evening, which I think testifies greatly to the kind of folks that Art+Reika are.'

Thankfully all the images from Gina Cristine  are nice and comfy in this gallery, and boy is it a beautiful place to be. See it all here.'
p2680
aS'Next was the wedding planning! First thing first, was picking a date for the special day! For a year a half, they planned for the best day of their lives and came about the wedding date by combing the days that mark both of their birthdays! Tim was born December 22nd, and Steph was born May 6th, so it made perfect sense to pick 06/22/13. Being from Chicago, they planned their big day in the city! They had a lot of fun traveling back and forth from D.C. to Chicago, meeting with vendors, enjoying food tastings, having bachelor/bachelorette parties, hair and makeup trials, multiple dress fittings, and finally picking out all of the details to make the day just perfect.\n\nSteph always envisioned their big day as something with a classic but modern chic feel while tying in some rustic accents. She wanted to turn the day into something truly beautiful and a day to definitely remember. She was fortunate enough to have a lot of close friends and family that have many great talents that helped the day turn into a unique event, and everyone made their mark in some way. Some examples of special touches; Tim had a custom made suit that fit to perfection, Steph added a customized belt that to her dress for personal detail, and Tim, Steph s father and brother all wore handkerchiefs in memory of the recent passing of Stephanie s grandmother on 05/22/2013. Steph s brother created the remarkable graphics on all of the stationery made for their day. Steph s cousin made all of the beautiful jewelry for the bridesmaids. Linda Farber, Stephanie s maid of honor (Sarah Farber) mother, was the florist. She did an amazing job creating arrangements that were beautiful and unique. Steph s maid of honor was also the connection to the wonderful work of the hair and makeup artists! Tim and Steph s officiant, Dale West, is a close friend and the fiance of one of Steph s bridesmaids, Sheila Walsh. Steph s mother, Pam, has a great talent for design and creativity and helped with ideas that were incorporated into the ceremony and reception decor, as well as Steph s jewelry and blusher. Stephanie wore a pearl bracelet that was created through each birthday that she has had. Her mom had purchased a pearl for every birthday, creating a string of pearls fit for a perfect wedding accent. It was very special to Stephanie and her mom. Pam also made the blusher that Steph wore during the ceremony. The single pearl on the headpiece belonged to her beloved grandmother, along with the handkerchiefs previously mentioned. A truly unique touch was when Steph s brother, Nigel Dennis, sang her down the aisle during the ceremony, and Alan Broomhead (Tim s father) performed during Tim s dance with his mother at the reception. The music selection was planned throughout the entire day and set the mood for a great party, from Tim and Steph s first dance to Alicia Keys Not Even The King, all the way to the very last choice, Kanye West Homecoming. Everything was planned to a T and they couldn t have imagined it any better! It really was the best day in both of their lives and a great start to a wonderful life in marriage together.'
p2681
aS'Having been married for a few months now, it has been such a great experience. Starting a new life together is full of unexpected possibilities and excitement! They look forward to traveling and living life to the fullest as newlyweds, with plans to start a family in a few years. No one knows what their future holds, but they are so happy to be able to spend the rest of it together!'

aS'Before the dinner, we took a quick stroll through Lincoln Park to get a few shots of the stunning couple, as well as snuck into the less-attractive, more unique and industrial parts of Chicago. The results were so fun, spontaneous and beautiful! The night couldn t have been more perfect with live music, cocktail hour, fun and good food.

S'Sophisticated and elegant, this Chicago wedding is all about the beautiful details.  I m talking drop-dead gorgeous florals from A Stem Above, a mesmerizing Pronovias gown and a Peninsula Hotel setting that will literally make your heart sing.  (It s true.)  In other words, it s a traditional stunner from start to finish and you can see every last love-filled moment captured by Emilia Jane Photography right here in the full gallery.'

aS'From the Bride  Our story is very unique.  Jimmy and I met randomly during the summer in Chicago   we all know how fun those are! I was en route to a concert with my best friend. We were waiting at a stoplight, and Jimmy rolled up to us on his bicycle (coming back from Castaways). Jimmy decided to strike up a conversation while we all waited for the light to change. It just so happens that he was going to the exact same concert as we were! Being the outspoken and daring guy that he is, he asked for my number and said we should hang out at the show   so we did! We ended up spending the summer together  and the rest is history!'
p2784
aS'When Jimmy proposed on my birthday trip to Chicago (we were living in New York at the time), we knew that there was no other place in the world we would rather tie the knot than Chicago. There are so many amazing venues in the city, so it was a hard choice for us to make, but the more and more we thought about it, we knew the Peninsula was the place for us. It was classic, open and airy, and Jimmy had experience throwing a party there before (with his Fraternity when he was in school at Northwestern). We wanted our wedding to be simple, elegant, and of course, an awesome party   which is exactly what we got. We couldn t have asked for more.'

Complete with blankets, pie, cozy sips, and kisses   consider this MY kind of wilderness adventure! The gallery from diana marie is bursting with pretty camping captures and we re announcing this week s winners down below. Happy weekend!'
p2801
aS'From diana marie photography  I ve known Kendra and Andrew for many years, and was there before they even started dating and when they met. Its been such a blessing and just wonderful to see them grow in so many ways the past 7 years. Andrew asked me to go ring shopping with him and help him with pulling off the proposal because Kendra figures everything out to quickly. '
p2802
aS'Andrew proposed at their usual spot they go and visit every year. At the Huntington Library in Pasadena. They go there each year for their anniversary to spend the day, and take a photo that has become sort of a tradition. Then they went to a coffee shop that was closed down and open just for us. Where Kendra was surprised with all her close family and friends, and to top off the surprise, Andrew planned his engagement session for the following day..He chose to do something with camping because its something they both love to do! It was such an honor and a privileged to watch this relationship grow and flourish into something so beautiful over the years. And am so very grateful that I was able to be there through it all.'

S'These two are awesome.  Like so seriously awesome that they managed to throw a stunning wedding that seamlessly combined modern stylings with rustic touches and romance as far as the eye can see.  And beyond all of the pretty (see: beautiful blooms from Hello Darling), they infused the entire day with sooo much personality. I m talking a Pittsburgh-style Cookie Bar and a cake cutting ceremony to  Pour Some Sugar On Me.   Dive into every amazing moment captured by Olivia Leigh Photography right here in the full gallery.'
p2841
aS'From Olivia Leigh  Emily and Ben had a gorgeous wedding that really crossed so many different styles and feels, but managed to effortlessly tie it all together. Emily and Ben are one of the most gorgeous couples I have ever met, and photographing them was such a pleasure, both from the beautiful and easy portraits to the emotional and heartfelt ceremony that was perfectly timed for the climax of sunset in the heart of Chicago. '
p2842
aS'The decor and flowers had a very vintage feel, with lots of golds and whites, but infused modernity with a sleek column gown, super modern short black shifts with exposed gold zippers for bridesmaid dresses, and amazing pointed toe black Tom Ford heels. The day also had a chic, romantic feel, but then amped up at the reception with an *amazing* band that the couple flew/drove in from the bride s home of Pennsylvania, with the singer rocking a keytar (yes) and doing a loungey rendition of  Baby Got Back  (yes yes). They also had a Pittsburgh tradition, a cookie table where tons of women attending the wedding baked probably a thousand cookies, along with a lovely cake that the couple cut to  Pour Some Sugar On Me.

S'This Chicago wedding by Robyn Rachel Photography is the definition of drool-worthy. From start to finish, it filled with wow-worthy details that could make your jaw drop a time or two. From the stunning jewerly to the gorgeous florals from A Stem Above to the beautiful couple saying I do   it s pure prettiness in every sense of the word, and there is even more to see right here.'
p2879
aS'From the Bride  Our theme was modern elegance with a Pakistani twist. We met, fell in love, and got engaged in Chicago so it seemed fitting to also get married in our favorite city. For our venue we chose our favorite hotel with our ideal style, The Wit Hotel. '
p2880
aS'Although the groom s family is from Chicago, the location was a destination for all other guests including Adnan and I. We met in medical school at Loyola University School of Medicine, but since graduating our residencies have taken us away from the city we love. We visit whenever possible and always stay at The Wit Hotel, making it our home away from home. We dated for almost six years before getting engaged on the Michigan Avenue Bridge over the Chicago River. We agreed immediately that we needed to get married in downtown Chicago. Planning a destination wedding was made carefree with our amazing wedding planner from Big City Bride. The week leading up to the wedding was filled with a Nikha, Mendhi and Walima all beautiful and colorful Muslim traditions. '
p2881
aS'The big day was started out with brunch, mimosas, hair and make-up in the wedding suite for the bride, mother of the bride and all of the bridesmaids. Everything about our big wedding day was a fusion between the two of us. The ceremony was short and simple with readings from the Bible and the Koran. My mom walked me down the isle and our families wrote letters to each other that we tied in a box with a ribbon, not to be opened until our 1-year anniversary. My dress was a simple light gold fitted dress accented with over-the-top sparkling Pakistani jewelry. My hair and make-up were perfect and beyond what I imagined. The ceremony was small, intimate and candle lit. It was perfection!'
p2882
aS'We then celebrated with a cocktail hour on the Roof at The Wit with beautiful photos of city views. Our reception was beautiful with gorgeous floral centerpieces and lighting filled with our color scheme of golds, purples, fuschia and orange, designed by A Stem Above. The reception was highlighted by dancing, humorous speeches and a photobooth. The food was superb and late night bites were a big hit. The cake was gorgeous and delicious; in fact people are still talking out the cake months after the wedding!'
p2883
aS'The entire day our amazing photographer, Robyn Rachel, created artistic and beautiful shots culminated with night time sparklers and images in front of the Chicago Theater. We have gorgeous photographic memories of the best day of lives.\n'

S'I ve professed my love for Chicago weddings a time or two on this blog, but I don t think I ll stop any time soon. Mostly when I come across a wedding like this one at The Drake. It s the definition of Chicago chic, and the exact reason why I will never tire of weddings in the windy city. It s filled to the brim with gorgeous florals from Exquisite Designs, a gorgeous cake from Amy Beck Cake Design that almost looks too pretty to eat, and it s all captured beautifully by Bellissima Photography    making me fall head over heels for Chicago weddings all over again. See why here.'

S'As much as I adore a beautiful rustic or traditional wedding, modern parties are my happy place.  Clean, sophisticated lines, simplistic + breathtaking stylings, bold + dramatic details  I can never get enough.  And when that contemporary pretty makes it way to me as a mesmerizing photo shoot from a talented team of vendors that includes CityGirl Weddings, Greenstar Paperie and Ann & Kam Photography, that s an entirely new level of happy.  See it all right here in the full gallery.'
p2965
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography  When dreaming about this shoot we, along with Sharokina from CityGirl Weddings, asked ourselves what a truly modern city wedding could look like. One of the wonderful things about a city like Chicago is the variety of styles and venues available, including wonderfully modern spaces like Venue SIX10. From the first time we visited, my husband, Kamran, and I were in awe of the open spaces, clean lines, wonderful light, and, of course, the amazing Michigan Avenue location of Venue SIX10. '
p2966
aS'Shar and I wanted to create a shoot that reflected the light and airiness of the modern space, with a pop of fun and whimsy. We chose a metallic silver with pops of yellow for our main colors. Adriana from Life Made Pretty provided the spectacular florals, from sophisticated calla lillies to light and delicate orchids. These provided a wonderful pop of color for the centerpieces as well as the lounge areas. Our outdoor lounge area, in particular, provided cozy chairs and an array of sophisticated florals that really popped against the cool blue of Venue SIX10 s outdoor balcony.'
p2967
aS'The beautiful gowns by VWIDON really set the tone for sleek sophistication. Venue SIX10 provided many of the accessories used in the shoot, including most of the jewelry and the sleek toasting flutes. Couples can purchase these unique and chic items right in the Venue SIX10 gift shop. What a cool way to remember your venue!'

aS'From Sarah  How lucky for Ellie and Jack to be married in Chicago! I can t get enough of this lovely city, with its mix of classic and modern architecture set alongside beautiful Lake Michigan. Their traditional ceremony took place downtown at Holy Name Cathedral, and photography followed along the lakeshore at Olive Park, with its stunning view of the Chicago skyline. Their reception at Hotel Palomar had a perfect clean and modern look, and I loved their stunning floral decor expertly and elegantly done by Yanni Design Studio.\n'

S'Beautiful barn weddings dripping in gorgeous DIY details are my favorite.  They re all at once intimate and lovely, with the sweetest atmosphere you could ever wish for on your wedding day.  Add in two cuties with a love that literally bursts from the computer screen, bundles of perfectly imperfect florals from Blooming Creations and fabulous paper goods designed by those aforementioned cuties and this, my friends, is the perfect way to spend your Wednesday.  See it all captured by Amanda Megan Miller in the full gallery.'
p3049
aS'From Amanda Megan Miller Photography  The chemistry between these two is just ridiculous. The way they just effortlessly settle into each others arms, they way they look at each other with unabashed love, and the way they make each other laugh with such ease   its like their love was written to be, written to fit together in this perfect way like puzzle pieces. Not only is their love a perfect fit, but so is their skill in the crafting department. Every single detail of their wedding was either a family heirloom, a hand-picked antique, or hand-crafted by the couple themselves! Jess says Bridgette comes up with the ideas and Jess figures out how to make it work! From the design and creation of their invitation suite to the amazing letter H marquee light for their reception backdrop! Everything was thought of and styled to perfection for their barn wedding!'

S'Door County is a Midwest gem. The heartland s answer to Cape Cod, if you will. So plop the prettiest editorial shoot right in the middle, and you ve got a recipe for gorgeousness. A.Styled Event, Buds  n Bloom, and Monograham gussied things up and The McCartneys Photography delivered BIG time behind the lens. Have a look right here.'
p3089
aS'From Anna of A.Styled Event Door County is a gem of its own, known as the Cape Cod of the Midwest, and is a popular vacation destination for Wisconsinites and neighboring states. While Door County offers state parks, blooming cherry orchards, miles of beautiful shoreline, and plenty of specialty shops and boutiques, it is no surprise why so many love to visit. Visitors surely appreciate the leisurely culture of the locals who have formed roots, offer knowledge, and bring distinction to this charming county. All of which served as inspiration for the details in this picturesque editorial shoot.'
p3090
aS'We envisioned an intimate rehearsal dinner, tucked along the shoreline of a childhood home that would showcase the couples adored Door County traditions, artisans, and style. A soft and natural color palette of blue, taupe, and orange were chosen to compliment the lovely shoreline of Lake Michigan. The perfect bamboo paper letterpress invitations, which are a mix of custom Smock designs from Monograham, were mailed to their closest family and friends.  Each guest received a welcome basket made of favorite local goodies; a fresh loaf of bread from Island Bread Company, fine olive oil and seasoning from Door County Olive Oil, apple cherry Island Orchard Cider, and more.'

aS'Buds n Bloom designed the fabulous floral elements that dressed the table, teepee and the stunning bride-to-bes floral crown. The centerpieces even included a Door County native flower! A romantic teepee was set to symbolize the couples love for camping in the state parks and served as a fun backdrop for guests to enjoy. The local farm-to-table menu was crafted with fresh Lake Michigan whitefish, vegetable garnish, and greens. Guests were enlightened with a famous Door County fish boil, followed by a delicious ombre cake from Flour Girl Patissier, a local pastry chef.'
p3092
aS'A.Styled Event provided the creative vision and direction for this amazing team, while The McCartneys Photography naturally captured every expression and detail, bringing this editorial shoot to life. We couldnt think of a better way to ease into your wedding day than with an intimate, relaxed, yet romantic gathering along the beautiful shoreline. We hope that this shoot serves as inspiration for brides looking to do just the same, perhaps even in beautiful Door County, Wisconsin!'

aS'From the Bride  Throughout our five years of being together, David and I have faced many obstacles along the way. Many of these obstacles stood in the way of us moving forward with our lives and ultimately tying the knot. When May 25th finally came I knew nothing could get in the way of what we had waited so long for. For a colder than average May day, the clouds and cool weather made for the most romantic setting. We loved our lakeside ceremony that was personalized just for us, our flowers that had a vintage spring feel and our spectacular tower of cupcakes that were a big hit. Most of all we loved the moments we had alone together that no one else could feel what we were feeling. Our family and friends were there when we read our personalized vows and our first dance was just magical. But when we saw each other for the first time by the beautiful lake, those are our moments and memories alone together. It was about David and me and our journey together. Realizing in those exact moments that everything that lead us to this particular day had all been worth the wait. \n'

S'Chicago has chic down to a science. I don t know what it is, but couples that call that city home know how to throw a glamorous affair. And this pretty little number from Robyn Rachel Photography and planned by Big City Bride is the perfect example. It s Louboutin s and a gorgeous Rivini gown. It s the gorgeous ballroom of Chicago Cultural Center filled with twinkling candles and florals from A Stem Above. This wedding is literally overflowing with gorgeous, and you can see it all right here.'
p3176
aS'From the Bride Jimmy and I knew that we wanted to get married in Chicago right away- we met in Chicago- in poetry class at Loyola, we had our first date in the city and eventually, 6 years later, he proposed in the city- at the Art Institute at the same Lion his grandfather proposed to his grandmother.  We still go to the same church in the city so we knew exactly where we wanted to have the ceremony. '
p3177
aS'We chose a winter wedding because Christmas is my favorite holiday and I LOVE the city right before the holidays with the lights and music.  Everyone always seems to be in a great mood around the holidays no matter what.  I wanted something different-after all, I had been in so many weddings, none of which were in the winter.  We wanted a wedding unlike any we had gone to before and this time of year was perfect for that.  '
p3178
aS'I would have to say I first knew I wanted a winter wedding when I saw Katherine Heigls wedding back in 2007-It was the first wedding I looked at in a magazine that truly took my breath away.   She did all red and white- with candles everywhere which I liked at the time but 5 years later, I changed my mind abit.   I wanted more of a glamour/vintage old Hollywood vibe while keeping it classic.  I was looking for inspiration in hundreds of magazines and finally I found this one bouquet with amnesia roses- the perfect  vintage  colored flower.  Its a pink/purple/beige/blue/gray color and it remains my favorite flower!  I chose ivory flowers because that has the winter/snow touch and the light blue berries/ dusty miller also gave it the winter/holiday feel.  I knew I wanted candles everywhere and mercury glass candle holders so I chose the textured gold table cloth to compliment the room and the mercuryglass.  The candles gave it the romantic/night time feel that I was going for- I had to keep in mind that it was going to be dark outside during the whole reception since I chose to have a winter wedding.  Rather than red, I chose eggplant was my  pop  of color to give the flowers, tables and room some dimension.  I chose green because it gave that tiny Christmas touch without being too clich.  I picked the mirrored Vases because my house is filled with mirrored furniture- I love it!!  The baby s breath at cocktail hour was inspired by the idea of making it feel like there was a huge poof of snow- It was important to me that I still had that winter vibe and since there was no snow outside that day- I am glad we had some inside (even if it was flowers).'
p3179
aS'I really took the beauty of the room & the Tiffany dome into account when choosing the color scheme.  I wanted to compliment the room not compete with it.  All the colors together looked so rich and sophisticated and that s exactly what I was going for!  We had round and rectangular tables and there were a total of 4 different tables capes. We wanted a combo of high and low center pieces.  We liked the dimension it added to the room and it was important to me that everyone could talk amongst each other at the tables.  The fruitwood chairs also gave it that touch of class I was going for.'
p3180
aS'I know that they like the DIY touches- I went to archivers for the favors and used a die cut to cut out all of the snowflakes and then I bought glitter spray to make them shimmer once they were cut and then I used 2 separate stamps for the  thank you  and the bride and groom.  Then we just pre tied them and bought the stickers to make then stay in place on the prosecco bottles.  Prosecco is my favorite wine and thats why we chose it as our favors for our guests.'

When a wedding has so much heart you can feel it through the computer screen, that s when I know it will resonate with everyone that passes by the pages of SMP today. This wedding from Photography by Katy Carlson has soul and then some, and it only takes one look at this gallery to see precisely what I m talking about. See it all here.'
p3204
aS'While some details were meticulously planned, others were left to unfold naturally such as the toasts and the open mic dancing. These spontaneous moments were what truly made the memories that night as they showcased what everyone who loved the couple was able to bring to the table. Following sparklers, the grooms dad even gathered everyone around to tell one of his kids  favorite  scary stories  while guests cozied on the benches with blankets that had been laid out. This truly blissful day was one that everyone, both young and old, will be remembering for years to come.'
p3205
aS'From the Groom  Remembering the wedding is a lot like those moments after sleep where you find yourself trying as hard as you can to hold onto the slipping details of a good dream. I remember the feeling of the small of Kayla s back when we kissed- delicate and a reminder, as well as a motivator for the sense of pride and protection I still feel. I remember the look of pride in my Father s eyes, and loves in my new Mother-in-law s. The lanterns reminded me of something out of Peter Pan, colored glowing mason jars suspended from trees like fireflies.\n'

S'It never fails.  Classic Chicago weddings always leave me speechless.  It s true  no matter how many beautiful affairs I lay my eyes upon, I am never quite prepared for just how truly amazing they are, or how chock-full of pretty they can be.  And when it comes to speech-defying beauties, this Drake Hotel soiree is most definitely ranking high atop the list with a gold meets pink color palette, two seriously stunning sweeties and moment after moment of pure elegance.  See it all captured by Shane Welch right here.'
p3269
aS'From the Bride  Our wedding day was what I had dreamt it to be and more. After several days of rain leading up to the wedding, it ended up being a beautiful Spring day in Chicago- 71 degrees, partially sunny with a slight breeze. We couldn t have asked for more perfect weather.'
p3270
aS'The bridal party started the day by getting make-up done by Kayla Consolo of Make U Bella Artistry in the Executive Suite at the Drake Hotel. Hair was done by stylists at Salon Buzz located a couple of blocks away from the hotel. I absolutely loved my hair and make-up. It was simple, elegant and timeless. By mid-morning our photographers, Shane Welch and Samuel Grove from Shane Welch Photography, arrived to photograph the bridal party getting ready.'
p3271
aS'My wedding dress was an Oscar de la Renta two-piece, ball gown with a heavy lace bodice and silk taffeta skirt. The seamstress from Ultimate Bride hemmed the front of the dress 4 inches short so the beautiful pleating of the underskirt was visible. The dress fit like a glove! I added a cathedral veil for extra drama but, the most unique and stunning part of my ensemble was my 1930s Ert earrings passed down to me from my grandma. I also wore a vintage pearl bracelet and a vintage diamond tennis bracelet.'
p3272
aS'The ceremony took place at Saint Vincent de Paul Parish in Lincoln Park. It was a beautiful, intimate ceremony. It was so special to have an entire church filled with all the people in our lives that love and support us. In between the ceremony and reception, the bridal party went to Montrose Harbor for additional photos. Our photographer, Shane Welch, scouted different areas a few days before our wedding and discovered a beautiful bird sanctuary along Lake Michigan with Chicago s skyline as the background. The setting was the perfect mix of nature and industrial!'
p3273
aS'The reception was held in the Gold Coast Room of The Drake Hotel, a Chicago landmark. The blush colored peony, rose and lemon leaf centerpieces by Anthony Gowder Designs, Inc. were soft and feminine which complimented the gilded ballroom beautifully. The finished room was absolutely breathtaking. We showcased our cake in the middle of the dance floor during dinner. Thanks to Amy Beck Cake Designs, our ombre blush and ivory butter cream cake was 5 tiers with each tier a different cake and frosting combination. The top of the cake was adorned with blush and pink peonies. A champagne toast parade started off the celebration and was followed by dinner, speeches and dancing. Our first dance was to  I Got You Babe  and was choreographed by Alex at Arthur Murray Studios. The band, Peter Hennes Orchestra, performed the song which definitely added to our special moment. The band played up-beat music the entire night as our guests danced the night away.'
p3274
aS'We had such a blast the entire day and night! I would not have changed one single thing. Our vendors were all amazing. We owe a special thank you to The Drake Hotel s Assistant Director of Catering, John Moses. We couldn t have pulled off such a spectacular day without his expert advice, patience and dedication to our wedding!'

S'What you are about to see is a lesson on how to plan the perfect wedding weekend. Rehearsal dinner, wedding, brunch  tie it all together so the images (like these gorg ones from Melissa Hayes Photography) flow in a way that is beautiful. This is a rehearsal dinner and a wedding all in one post, and even I am learning so much about honing in on your specific style. I love it!'
p3320
aS'From the gorgeous bride  If you build it, they will come. Bruce and I met in Washington, DC almost six years ago. After a long courtship he popped the question and we decided to plan our wedding in my hometown of Cedar Rapids, IA. We wanted to be sure that the wedding reflected the two of us and we sought out to make things as personal as possible. As this was a destination wedding for so many out of town guests, we wanted to plan lots of wedding weekend events to be sure our friends and family enjoyed everything Iowa had to offer.'
p3321
aS' We held our large rehearsal dinner at the gorgeous Sutliff Cider Barn that overlooks acres and acres of Iowa farm country. It was a casual and relaxed evening that couldnt have been more perfect. Our rehearsal fell on the Summer Solstice and despite the morning thunderstorms, we were blessed with an evening filled with lots of natural light. After seeing our guests surprised faces as they exited the buses for dinner, I was confident that we succeeded in showing everyone how much beauty Iowa has to offer.'
p3322
aS' One of my favorite moments occurred before the ceremony. As we pulled up to the church, I was greeted outside by my nervous and emotional Father. He and I have always had a special relationship and I was so pleased that we were able to share a few moments together in the courtyard before he escorted me down the aisle as a string quartet played In My Life by The Beatles.'
p3323
aS' Following the ceremony, we held our reception at the Cedar Rapids Country Club a location that holds many memories from my childhood. It was fun to be announced as husband and wife in the very ballroom where I had spent so many celebratory occasions growing up. I was so happy that we were able to take photographs outside on the golf course and our guests were able to enjoy the view from the patio during our cocktail hour.'
p3324
aS' Planning our wedding from Washington, DC was only possible with the help of my Mother, who thankfully did the lions share of the work. We decided on a color scheme that included navy, toast and a little hint of coral. We worked with a local artist in Iowa to create our stunning invitations and wanted all of our paper products to mirror the same look, using the same combination of colors and fonts. The flowers turned out beautifully delicate peach David Austin roses, cream peonies and dahlias and lots of greenery. My Mother found lace tablecloths to complement my lace dress and we used lots of candles and mercury glass candle votives to decorate the tables at the reception.'
p3325
aS' Im still so touched by the many friends and family who traveled to Iowa to help us celebrate our wedding. The weekend was absolutely perfect in every way and it was truly a weekend that we will never forget.'

S'I m one of those sappy romantics that believes in fate, true love and all things meant-to-be.  One of those ladies who can t seem to ever get enough of a romantic story (here s to you, Jane Austen) or a fabulous, love-filled wedding.  And when I meet two cuties as sweet as this adorable duo captured by Ashley Biess Photography, my day jumps from amazing to outrageously happy.  Because these are the type of sweethearts that have a story that is beyond movie-worthy (hint: they met in pre-school) and a wedding that is chock-full of pretty.  See it all in the full gallery.'
p3375
aS'From Ashley Biess Photography  About 20 years ago, Emily, JT and the rest of their pre-school class gathered around the playground for a class photo. Everyone smiled for the camera and then resumed back to their games and play time. It was Emily and JT s first photo together; and while they didn t know it at the time, it would certainly not be their last. These two little pre-schoolers would meet again later in life, and someday become best friends and husband and wife.'
p3376
aS'Emily and JT s wedding, in one word, was perfect. It was the most beautiful Spring day at the Morton Arboretum, where guests gathered in the Hedge Garden to watch the couple s knot tying ceremony. The vibrant yellow flowers and handcrafted decor made the sunny day shine even brighter. JT s heartfelt vows to his bride had everyone in tears. Guests applauded and cheered as JT and Emily shared their first married kiss.'
p3377
aS'At their reception, beauty was everywhere to be found! Everything from the flowers to the handmade decorations to the room itself at the Morton Arboretum were perfect for their summery wedding. The room looked effortlessly gorgeous and fit perfectly with their personalities, style, and story. Emily s pinwheels were found as both decor and escort cards, leading guests to their tables. Friends and family wrote well wishes to the couple on Jenga pieces, so that Emily and JT can reread the happy notes every time they play. My favorite detail was JT s home brewed beer and root beer, appropriately titled Something Brewed, that he made special for all of their guests. It was a big hit!'

aS'From the Bride  One of my favorite memories of the day was hearing my husband s vows to me and all the emotion that he had behind them. His words were filled with love and affection. For him to confess his love in the most raw form, in front of our family and friends, was absolutely amazing. Another moment that I won t forget is sitting with my husband at our table watching all of our guests dancing and enjoying themselves on the dance floor. It whas at that point that I realized how after 18 months of planning for our wedding, it turned out to be even better than I had envisioned.'

PenWeddings is a favorite because of that one reason. They always have the most inspiring stories. I especially love how these two decided to exchange traditional vows  but exchange their own, personal vows at their first look. It s perfect.'

aS'From the cinematographer  Angie and Jake made me cry three times during their wedding day. And I promise you it s not just because Jake is my nephew. First, at their first look. They chose to do traditional vows during their ceremony, but read personal vows to one another when they saw each other for the first time. Cry baby time #2: Jake s reaction to Angie coming down the aisle. And then the waterworks hit most people in the room when Jake and Angie presented a rose to Jake s mother, step-mom, and Angie s mother who is battling Lou Gehrig s Disease. But don t let the tears fool you, their wedding day was filled with love, laughter and smiles.\n'

S'I m generally a very productive person. I thrive on to-do lists and projects, but when I come across a wedding like this one captured by Lauren Wakefield, all bets are off. I drop everything I am doing to sit and stare at the pretty, fully blaming it on the fact that doing so is indeed my job. Because this is a wedding filled with the perfect amount of pretty and the perfect amount of heart, and you can see precisely what I am talking about right here in the full gallery of images.'
p3452
aS'Jeremiah and I were those nerds that started planning our wedding about three months after we got engaged. We just knew it was going to happen and I have always been an organized and chaotic nut. He was amazingly hands-on throughout the entire process from creating spreadsheets for our vendors to helping me pick out each and every decor item and dessert. It was such a blessing to have someone who was the perfect teammate!'
p3453
aS'The first and best choice we made was choosing Lauren Wakefield to be our photographer. When we met it was over a glass of sangria at a little pub in Chicago where we talked for hours like old friends. She shot our fantastic engagement photos first and made both of us feel way less awkward than we anticipated so by the time she shot our wedding it was a breeze! She has a talent that is rare to be seen, knowing how to capture the softest moments and make them feel real again when you see them in a photo. She is a true treasure and just a beautiful person inside out. I can tell you now she will be the one documenting every other important part of my life! (Sorry for your luck Lauren)'
p3454
aS'We knew we wanted a rustic outdoor setting and we loved the idea of having our guests be able to interact with the venue. We found Oak Hill after hours and hours of googling and as soon as we walked onto the property we knew it was where we would get married. The owner, Becky, was absolutely amazing and took the time to sit down with us, take a tour and detail out the best ways to handle everything. Her family had originally spent summers on the land and after several years of collecting antiques (including an amazing 1960s church that was actually moved by flatbed to their land in honor of her father) they have turned it into a one-of-a-kind wedding venue. She was an absolute Godsend throughout the process, we had to have exchanged over 200 emails in the course of a year and she made it all so much easier on us.'
p3455
aS'She gave us several referrals to local catering services, florists and bakeries which we chose with ease. Our baker, Mary did a phenomenal job on our beautiful dessert table from her homemade pies to the decadent carrot cake. They were all gone by the time I made my way over there so she must have done something right! Our florist, Jean and I also became fast friends exchanging tons of emails and calls so she could perfect our centerpieces and bouquets. She outdid herself. Not only were they breathtaking but just exactly what I was looking for.'
p3456
aS'We also found an incredibly talented band in Chicago-One, Unity Candle. They were easy to work with, so friendly and even helped us out with our ceremony music by letting one of their singers sing my favorite song  I Have and Always Will  by Dave Barnes as I walked down the aisle. They got everyone on the dance floor during the reception and even let Jeremiah and the band he used to play with a few years back get on stage with their instruments! It was the best moment of the entire wedding seeing my husband sing on stage at his own wedding and we had several people tell us in the coming weeks that it was the best wedding band they had yet to see.'
p3457
aS'I was also blessed with an amazing family to say the least. My mother, sister, aunt and cousin all had big hands in creating the elegant country wedding we both so dearly wanted. They helped me spend hours upon hours creating honey jar favors, signs for the dessert table, programs and several other paper crafts. A lot of time was spent at JoAnn Fabrics, Michaels and collecting different cake plates from all over. My aunt made the sweet little gingham bow ties for the groomsmen, the flower girl baskets and several other wonderful items that were scattered all over the venue. My bridal party who are my heart and soul also did their part from helping me shop for dresses to writing out the several chalk boards I found at local flea markets to fluffing up dozens of pom-poms to hang from the ceiling of the tent.'
p3458
aS'The process of course could be stressful at times but one thing I can t repeat enough to brides is to let each step of the way be fun, don t get too down on yourself for forgetting something at home or getting a slightly different colored item than you thought. Also make it your own! We chose a venue that let us choose every vendor and do everything ourselves. Our wedding day went by in a blur just like everyone says it does, we even forgot to cut the cake! But it was completely magical. You don t realize how much people truly love you and support you until they trek three and a half hours to come for your special day! Remember the most important thing is that you are marrying this person who is going to be your everything and that you will always get through every stressful part that comes up because you are in it together.\n'

The sort of affair that stops your day in the best kind of way with crazy gorgeous DIY details, glittery gold accents (YES) and moment after moment of pure perfection planned by Sweetchic Events.  This, my friends, is take your breath away pretty and you can see it all captured beautifully by Dawn E. Roscoe in the full gallery.'
p3530
aS'From Dawn  Karen and Steve wanted a fun, light-hearted wedding where they didn t take themselves too seriously and where there would be a lot of dancing. The two met in NYC where they currently live, but coincidentally were both from Chicago. Wanting to share the hometown they love with their guests, the city of Chicago was their inspiration. In addition to choosing an iconic Chicago venue for their wedding, bits of the city showed up in their wedding details, and the night concluded with surprise Chicago deep dish pizza and hot dogs for their guests and a love-filled sparkler send off for the newlyweds.  The entire day was full of personalized details that really showcased the couple s story, love for Chicago and cute surprises along the way.'
p3531
aS'A few highlights '
p3532
aS'Cake Topper: Karen ordered this as a surprise for Steve, who loved that the topper was wearing one of his straight brim hats and his favorite sneakers (which have the Chicago skyline on the sides).'
p3533
aS' Mason Jar Centerpieces: The centerpieces and all the frames were spray painted by Karen & Steve in his parents  garage (his parents would come out from time to time and wonder what the heck we were doing). We then also took the encyclopedia set at their house that Steve never used as a child.'
p3534
aS'Paper Suite: The escort cards, invitations with the Chicago skyline envelope liners, programs, photo bookmarks and menus were made by Karen and her sister.'
p3535
aS'Dessert Table: The dessert table let people  Choose their city  with both NY and Chicago themed cookies and also featured Steve s favorite Peanut M&Ms (totally ruining our color scheme)!'
p3536
aS'Coasters: The coasters told their story in a short and sweet way.'
p3537
aS'Ring Pillow: The ringbearer s pillow was a football, again due to Steve s obsession.'
p3538
aS'Lots of pics: Instead of a slideshow, our baby pictures were incorporated throughout the card table and above the bathroom signs. The photo locations we chose also were to feature Chicago   the Chicago L stop, LaSalle Street bridge, Art Institute Gardens, and Merchantile Exchange on LaSalle Street.'

And with Christopher|F Photography there to document every darling detail, there s a whole lot of swoonage from this Midwest affair waiting for you here.'
p3575
aS'The day of the wedding, everything came together perfectly. All the people who worked so hard and genuinely wanted our day to be great cannot be thanked enough. From our patient and flexible wedding coordinator Shari, to our caterer Tasia from Catering 59 who provided delicious food (people are still talking about it), to our talented photographer Christopher from Christopher F Photography, to the Paper Spot for providing attentive and helpful service for the wedding invitations and thank you s, to our videographer and family friend Bob, to our florist Kim from Jewel, to my make-up artist Linda from Beautify Spa and Make-up, to the photo booth company Platinum Flash, to the amazingly talented band The Bluewater Kings, to my personal decorators Aunt Claudia, Uncle Lowell and family friends Mary and Carol, to the great people behind the scenes who helped with the wedding video my brother-in-law Tom, and husbands friends Jason and Pat, to Bella Sposa for helping me find the perfect dress, to Janet from Jos F. Bank for providing quality service for the suits, to our Pastor Scott Kircher from Hickory Creek for presiding over our marriage, to Emerson Creek for making sure the venue looked in pristine condition, to Travel Tap for serving our guests with a smile, to all of our guests who came from great distances to share in our day, to our families who made our day so meaningful by being able to watch 19 of our nieces and nephews walk down the isle, to our great friends who happily stood up which made us feel honored, and most of all to our parents for all their financial support, love, and encouragement throughout the whole process.'
p3576
aS'I will always remember all the little details from that day that so often go unnoticed, but take lots of time, coordinating, and planning  the floral and striped straws, the mason jars and watering cans that held all the colorful wildflowers for centerpieces and the aisle, my blue toe nail polish for my something blue, the honey jar wedding favors/table numbers, the photo app card for our guests to capture the night, my cowboy boots, the simple and elegant wedding invitations and thank you s, the candles and frog lids on all the center piece mason jars, the programs for the ceremony, my veil, the handkerchiefs for all the groomsman and groom, the haystacks for the kids to sit on after they walked down the isle, the suspenders on the little boys and the dads, the perfectly coordinated and pressed t-shirts, suits, shoes, socks and belts for the groomsman, ushers, and groom, the balloons and sign (Kerry and Jeff Wedding) at the entrance of Emerson Creek, the amazing pie display in the wooden hutch and drawers, the catering company who wore chef hats, the complimentary water and lemonade offered by Emerson Creek for guests at the ceremony, the mothers  dresses, shoes, and jewelry, the flower girl baskets, cowboy boots, and wreaths in their hair, the junior bridesmaids slippers and flower in their hair, the casual look of the Jr. Groomsman ties and rolled up sleeves, the wooden card holder crate and hand-crafted wedding guestbook and wooden pens in the stump holder, and the list goes on and on!'
p3577
aS'The surrounding scenery that day was breathtaking with a background set to wildflowers, evergreens, green rolling hills, corn fields, a beautiful blue barn with white sliding doors and chandeliers, an old gravel road, and a tea room with a country porch and rocking chairs as the sun was setting it made everything surrounding the farm and the barn just sparkle. It was the middle of July and we had weather in the low 80 s with complete sunshine! Amazing for an outdoor wedding in the summer! It was truly a PERFECT day!'
p3578
aS'God couldn t have made this day any more amazing! The sounds and visuals of our family and friends laughing and conversing meant so much to us. To think  15 years ago in 8th grade I would meet the man I was going to marry has been my greatest blessing in disguise.\n'

aS'From the photographer  In the gorgeous light of pastoral Aurora, OH, Carley and John married in a traditional ceremony surrounded by 230 of their nearest and dearest in a wedding that was a perfect blend of traditional, rustic and elegant.'
p3629
aS'Carley is fortunate enough to have brilliant stationer, Lauren Chism, as her older sister which meant that her paper suite was flawless   a mixture of charming gilded calligraphy and a beautiful patterned paisley letterpress.'
p3630
aS'The colors of the day continued the theme of muted golds, and silvers (as highlighted by the 1920 s inspired bridesmaid s cocktail dresses,) and coral accents like those seen in Carley s elegant Prada shoes. These elegant touches were a dramatic compliment to her delicate lace gown. I was absolutely obsessed with her bouquet: a combination of rustic herbs (lavender, and other seasonal offerings,) with the classic elegance of peonies and traditional ivy. Needless to say it smelled divine!'
p3631
aS'Following their deeply emotional and heartfelt ceremony, the couple found themselves whisked away to the reception under a shower of tossed lavender in a fabulous vintage Cadillac.'
p3632
aS'Their ballroom reception featured centerpieces that seemed effortlessly handpicked from a perfectly manicured wildflower and herb garden, a trio of cakes which appeared frosted by hand with decadent buttercream, and more beautiful calligraphy touches by Courtnie Johnson of Poppy Pedals.'
p3633
aS'I felt so honored to be a part of capturing this beautiful love story on film. As the cloudy sky burst into a gorgeous Ohio sunset right as we began their portraits I felt that I was part of something truly miraculous! Congrats Carley and John!'

S'Rustic meets elegant meets one adorable duo, and the result? Well it s prettiness defined. The Riviera Country Club set the stage for the prettiest of parties, and with the help of Occasions, Holly Flora and A Sweet Design, every detail tucked in this gallery is worthy of your favorite pin board. So feel free to join us drooling over every detail, right here.'

aS'From the Bride  I ve loved Quincy from the moment I saw him 12 years ago at the Century City Food Court (very romantic). He was on a blind date with my girlfriend, who conveniently brought me along as her sidekick. That love fizzled, but my love for Quincy grew through the years, even though it took him a little while (9 years!) to  come around.  Quincy and I were both born in Los Angeles and went to USC together (but not  together ) where his fraternity was across the street from my sorority. I would spy on him at football games and hope one day he would love me, and finally a few months after we both graduated, he did! But our relationship was not an easy one, nine months after we started dating, Quincy moved to Georgia to begin his Officer Training in the Army, and I stayed back in Los Angeles. We spent nine months apart and then Quincy moved to Fairbanks, Alaska to his duty station. He deployed a few months after that for a year long deployment. When he returned in April 2012, I decided I couldn t stand being apart much longer and packed up my things and moved to be with him! And from there, I planned a wedding in Los Angeles!'
p3682
aS'For as long as I can remember, my dad used to take me into the Crystal Ballroom at The Riviera Country Club and tell me,  This is the place you are going to get married.  So when Quincy asked me to marry him last June, I immediately knew it had to be at The Riv. I didn t want to do the traditional black-tie affair that The Riv s atmosphere caters to; instead I really wanted to make it my own. My vision was rustic meets elegant.'
p3683
aS'Q and I wanted our wedding to be more on the casual side, so instead of making our invitations very formal, Sloane Harmony created a fun, very  us  invitation with pinks, beiges and a burlap wrap. She kept the fonts and overall feel of our invitations for the rest of our paper goods including our escort cards, a welcome note and a very casual program that had a sense of humor (like us!).'
p3684
aS'To incorporate  us  in our ceremony and throughout our reception, we placed framed photos of us as well as fun items with our initials on them around. Since we have such unique initials (it is impossible to find things with a Q on them), we have been collecting items with our initials on them since we started dating. We used our initials for most of our wedding, K & Q Get Married! We even had our guests hashtag our wedding with #kandqgetmarried so that we could have all of our photos in one place!'
p3685
aS'I wanted our cocktail reception to really be Q s moment (a bride gets the whole day, I wanted my groom to have an hour), so we focused on all things Q! He is a lover of Jameson whiskey (and his mom is from Ireland!), so we placed bottles with flowers around the reception area. We also wanted to incorporate America without being cheesy (no red, white and blue) and so we bought this fabulous wooden flag from Pottery Barn and hung it above the escort cards. And finally, Q LOVES coffee. He is a true coffee aficionado and so we had our escort cards sitting in cigar boxes filled with coffee beans and surrounded by flowers.'
p3686
aS'We had Alaskan beer offered at the bar to give an homage to our current hometown. And Q and I each had a fun signature drink  The K    Moscow Mule and  The Q    Jameson on the rocks. At some point in the night, the bartenders began making  The K & Q  which was a Moscow Mule with Jameson added.'
p3687
aS'For our flowers, I wanted them to look like they had just been plucked from the garden (no big bouquets) and Holly Flora was my one and only choice. For our outdoor ceremony, Becky and Holly covered the 10 foot tall gazebo with vines, which made it look like the flowers had grown naturally from the ground. We also had a gathering of small bud vases on a table behind us to give the gazebo some depth. For the reception, the girls created small groupings of flowers in mismatched vases including colored glass, mason jars, old tea kettles and vintage pieces to make my vision come alive. We also had individual balsa wood flowers placed on every place setting.'
p3688
aS'Desserts are MY thing. I didn t want to just have cake, instead I wanted a selection of desserts for our guests. We had the girls from A Sweet Design create mini cookies and milk, cupcakes, cake pops and marshmallow pops for our guests to snack on. And Q s mom made our wedding cake from scratch for us to cut into.'
p3689
aS'My favorite part of whole day was walking down through the saber arch, a military tradition where the newly married couple must kiss before being allowed entrance. Once the bride and groom walk through, the bride gets a (very rough) pat on the butt with one of the sabers and the soldiers say,  Welcome to the Army mam!  This was the perfect end to our ceremony.'
p3690
aS'Our photographer Jen couldn t have made our day any easier. She captured our perfect moments without being in the way or making our day any more stressful. I love the way she caught the smallest details that I missed when I was walking down the aisle like the bud vases and framed pictures. She made it a night that I can relive forever through photos!'
p3691
aS'In Japanese tradition, my mom, aunts and family friends made 1000 gold origami cranes for my wedding. A thousand paper cranes are traditionally given as a wedding gift by family, who are wishing a thousand years of happiness and prosperity upon the couple. The construction of a thousand gold paper cranes symbolizes good fortune, fidelity and longevity. When my parents got married, they were surrounded by a thousand paper cranes made by my mom s mother and grandmother and I was lucky to be surrounded by 1000 at mine. '

S'This is why I love Illinois weddings.  One minute I m basking in a contemporary rooftop soiree in downtown Chicago, the next I m seriously swooning over a classically gorgeous Winnetka Community House affair with vibrant hues, lush florals from Morning Glory and the perfect dash of whimsy.  It s the the reason I adore my job (with a passion) and the reason I plan on spending every last minute of my day soaking in all of the love-filled moments captured by Katherine Salvatori Photography.  Join me in the gallery for all of the pretty.'
p3739
aS'From the Bride  We met playing pub trivia in Chicago. We were both on opposite teams, and we were quite competitive with each other. After many weeks of seeing each other every Wednesday night, Chris asked me on a date. The first date was at a local restaurant, and we talked for over five hours. It was a sign of many more good dates to come. The wedding was inspired by the venue (Winnetka Community House). We wanted something casual, yet elegant. The garden courtyard and reception hall with French doors provided an indoor/outdoor feel. We also wanted Chicago to be present in our wedding, so all of our tables were named after Chicago neighborhoods.'
p3740
aS'From Katherine Salvatori Photography  This wedding was absolutely stunning. The ceremony space had old, Italian styled arches, and the layout of the community house had such an intimate feel. Holly and Chris put so much time and attention into the details of their wedding, from the gorgeous floral arrangements to incorporating their love of the city into the table arrangements at the reception. Nothing was overlooked!'

S'First looks are my favorite part of any wedding. But when the bride and groom plan a secluded first look at sunrise, it makes for a moment that s seriously special. Woodnote Photography captured a layer of intimacy and emotion that only the best photographers can do. And the words from the groom? Well, they re enough to bring a girl to tears.  When I saw Jessica in the field for the first time that morning, I was very overwhelmed with love, joy, and peace.  I instantly broke out in tears as my anxiousness left me and my bride was by my side.  Grab yourself a tissue and join me for the full wedding right here.'
p3789
aS'From Woodnote Photography These two met at a Bible Study, and became friends.  Jessica was training for triathlons, (have I mentioned that she s already completed an Iron Man?!  The girl is a legend..), so eventually they started doing workouts together.  Robert thought things were going pretty well, so he asked if Jessica would like to go out, and she flat out said no!  (But did apologize to Robert if she had led him on )  Robert explained,  After taking such a blow, I fell behind the scenes for a while only to reappear months later to spend more time with her biking or running. I eventually worked up the courage again (over a year later) to see if she would like to get to know each other again and to my delight she said, Sure   Since then weve been two peas in a pod.   (And as the photographers who have gotten to spend time with Jessica + Robert together, we can absolutely testify to the fact that these two are absolutely in love, and completely meant for each other!)'
p3790
aS'Jessica + Robert got married on a Sunday morning in May, and started their ceremony with a tea bar   greeting their guests as they arrived, and handing them a freshly baked scone in a bag that was labeled with their wedding program.  Immediately following the ceremony, a lovely brunch was served at their reception, which ended up meaning that the best time for Jessica + Robert s portraits was   at sunrise.  When I first wrote the email to them, suggesting the wild + crazy idea, I thought,  well.. they might just laugh in my face    but then they reminded me that they re both athletes who are constantly training for big events, and so they re used to getting up ludicrously early.  (Hooray!)  Let s face it.  The lighting at sunrise just can t be beat.  Not to mention the incredible poetic beauty of seeing your love for the first time on your wedding day, all alone, watching the sunrise together.  '
p3791
aS'Robert s way of retelling his memory of the first look is beyond beautiful,  When I saw Jessica in the field for the first time that morning, I was very overwhelmed with love, joy, and peace.  I instantly broke out in tears as my anxiousness left me and my bride was by my side. '
p3792
aS'After the first look and portraits with the maid of honor + best man, there was time to go out for a delightful breakfast together at Andrew s Restaurant inside the Delafield Hotel!  It was such an incredible morning, with a nice little relaxed break in between photos + the ceremony to spend time together, and relax, too.  From our perspective, it was completely worth the 4am wakeup call, and Jessica + Robert say it was, too!  They told us,  We both thoroughly loved seeing each other for the sunrise pictures.  It calmed so many nerves, and was a great moment with each other. We also loved getting breakfast right after pictures at Andrews Restaurant with the bridal party and Caroline and Jayden. '
p3793
aS'Without further ado, we re quite excited to share these images with you all today.  But before we go, here s a final word of advice for future brides/grooms currently planning their wedding from Jessica + Robert:   Short engagements! Ours was under 4 months and it was a DIY wedding!  You can do it! '

Not only being sentimental to Jimmy and Erin, it lent for a fabulous backdrop! The rest of the session took us to Veteran Acres Park, one of my personal favorite places. As I am sure you can see, they are ridiculously adorable together!! So meant to be!! I am so glad that I have been given the chance to capture their love for one another.

Our plan had become to have them see each other before the ceremony and hope that we were able to be outside for at least a few pictures. Well, Mother Nature decided to cooperate with us and shine a full day of sun for Jennifer & Christopher. Not a drop fell. It was perfect!! They were able to have their outdoor ceremony as well as all of their pictures outside.\n\nJennifer s dress was so classically romantic. She looked absolutely stunning, it fit her perfectly!! From the bride, My Mom had a full lace dress for her wedding day. She looked so beautiful and romantic in her photos. So I knew I wanted to wear a lace dress for my wedding. When I found the dress, I fell in love with the gorgeous lace pattern and knew it was the one! '

S'When I was a little girl I wanted a gold room, but when my mom said no, I settled for mint. Not much has changed in the past 20 years or so  mint and gold is the color combo that still totally owns my heart. So when Take a Seat sent this inspiration shoot (shot in my home state, no less!) featuring my colors, I was totally smitten. Especially after laying eyes on that floral crown from Passionflower. Amanda Dumouchelle Photography has put together a gallery that fulfills all my girlhood fantasies. Care to join me?'
p3919
aS'From the designer  The private residence in Pinckney, Michigan selected for the shoot is a special location for us here at Take A Seat Events. The rustic villa-like exteriors of the beautiful home, coupled with the breathtaking lakefront setting is what inspired our vision for this contrasting  shabby chic meets elegant  theme.'
p3920
aS'As we began brainstorming details for this inspiration shoot, we came across the incredible ivory and gold chevron sequin linen, which became the focal point on which we based the rest of the event design on. The mint accents pulled together the two different styles of rust and elegance for a soft, summer look whilst the romantic invitations along with the raw simplicity of the chalkboard signs perfectly complimented our overall concept.'
p3921
aS'We recruited an incredibly talented group of vendors that completely blew us away by bringing our vision to life. All of the little details, from the delicate, meadow-like flowers, to the one-of-a-kind vintage rentals and the ombre wedding cake, were truly works of love and creative passion from everyone involved. Our amazing photographer, Amanda Dumouchelle, was able to capture all of these lush details as well as the chemistry of our good friends, Jim & Carrie Aulette, who will be celebrating their five year wedding anniversary this upcoming October.'
p3922
aS'As an event planning company who believes in creating bespoke events that illuminate a true labor of love, we feel that this  shabby chic meets elegant  inspiration shoot could not have been more successful in exemplifying what we stand for and who we are. A special thank you to all of the participating vendors for helping us make this possible!'

aS'From Jacqui Cole Photography Strolling down Oak Street beach at 5am on a gorgeous summer s morning Deidre, Ben and I captured their beautiful love in front of Lake Michigan. We opted for a soft, romantic and casual beach look to watch the sunrise and continue to head into the city for a more chic and elegant feel. Deidre and Ben instantly warmed up to the camera and were so natural in each others embrace. We wiped the sand off our feet and enjoyed the empty streets of Michigan Avenue, stopping at the Drake Hotel and Watertower Place.'
p3949
aS'Deidre and Ben met while at Ohio State University and continue their relationship long distance while Ben lives in Boston (hoping to come to Chicago very soon!) I am sure that part of the magic of this engagement session is the limited time this couple have to share and their inspiring outlook that they appreciate every minute they have together.'

S'Meeting the love of your life in eighth grade is one of those oh-so-amazing stories you couldn t even make up if you tried; the sort of story where it s clear Cupid had a plan for you and yours all along.  And when you follow up that fateful meeting in science class (and 13 years of courtship!) with a drop-dead gorgeous vintage meets rustic wedding at the breathtaking Danada House, it s the perfect chapter to one crazy fabulous fairytale.  One that includes the beautiful stylings and florals of The Perfect Pick and one love-filled moment after another captured by Chrystl Roberge Photography.  See them all right here.'
p4036
aS'From the Bride  Our love story began in the eighth grade. Dan s neighborhood had been moved to my middle school and he sat behind me in science class. He has always been a little bit rebellious and a daredevil; we girls can t help but fall for the bad boy! After exchanging shy smiles, we soon embarked on a romance that wove in and out of our lives for the next thirteen years! '
p4037
aS'Dan is the most selfless and loving person I have ever met. Together, we share a passion of always helping and caring for others. When planning our special day, it was essential for our wedding to capture the special memories we have created together throughout the years and include the people who have supported and fostered our relationship. It was important to both of us that our wedding was unique and memorable. We knew we wanted to find a venue where we could hold both the ceremony and reception. Dan and I really liked the idea of getting married outdoors with the sun beginning to set at the end of the ceremony. When Dan s brother Adam, the best man, raved about a wedding he had attended at the Dananda House, we had to check it out! We loved the tidy gardens, vast landscape, and the atrium with three walls of ceiling to floor windows that overlooked the forest preserve. We immediately knew that this was the ideal place for us to officially tie the knot!\n\nPart of the theme that we selected had that strong rustic feel, with elements of birch and trees in the invitations, floral arrangements and wedding d cor. My friends tease me that my home looks like a picture out of the Pottery Barn catalog, so I was immediately drawn to the rustic and vintage details of mercury glass and lanterns. The lanterns were used to line the aisle and reused on guests  tables during the reception. Mercury glass candles, globes, vases and votives offered delicate decoration to the cocktail, guest, feasting, dessert, and place card tables. Romantic details came in the rich fabrics of my dress, bouquet ribbon, flower selection, calligraphy, and candle lighting. Skeleton keys adorned place cards to capture a classic vintage feel for guests.\n'
p4038
aS'One of my favorite details of our wedding was the feasting table. Both Dan and I wanted our attendants to feel comfortable and happy at our wedding. We knew from experience that it is no fun to be separated from your date during dinner. As soon as we heard about the feasting or harvest table idea, we knew that was what we wanted. Our table was so elegant! Blush satin table cloths lined our table, ruffle chair covers noted the bride and groom s special seats, and blush, ivory and apricot flowers were accented by soft mercury glass votives. Dan and I had the perfect view of all of our guests and the band! '
p4039
aS'I could not have made a better decision than hiring Stephanie at the Perfect Pick to do my flowers. She handpicked every single bloom herself and put together the most amazingly beautiful arrangements I have ever seen. The slightest detail was not overlooked. Dan s boutonni re was wrapped in birch bark to match not only the reception d cor, but to accent the strips of birch elegantly woven in my bouquet. Stephanie incorporated ruffles and romantic textures in all of her work to capture the carefree and personable attitudes that Dan and I share. '
p4040
aS'Stephanie soon introduced us to the adorable Emily Cavanagh who would help personalize so many important details for our wedding. Emily has such a flair for gorgeous handwriting and we put her talent to work! Emily hand wrote each address on beautiful teal envelopes. Using a fabric swatch, she searched for the perfect teal envelope to match the bridesmaid dresses. Emily also designed the wedding invitation. On the back of the invite, it looks like birch bark with a K&D lettering that appeared to be carved into the bark. This small detail made the invitation so personal and went with the rustic theme. A hand-drawn, watercolor map of the key locations was included to help guests navigate between the hotel and Danada House. Each invitation was carefully tied together with a crinkled silk ribbon and paper heart, which incorporated the same style as the save the date and wedding details. '
p4041
aS'There were countless personalized details that reflected details about us as a couple. The many uses of books and book pages reflected our mutual love of reading. Our ceremony programs were book marks with one of our engagement pictures for our guests to reuse after the wedding. Our favors were delectable caramel apples from Rocky Mountain Chocolate factory (with no peanuts because Dan is allergic). I am a teacher, so the books and apples went perfectly with my profession! Each bar had our favorite/specialty drinks with large coffee table books with menu items written in calligraphy. Every detail fit together perfectly. '
p4042
aS'Collecting wedding details soon became a family and friends project! Both of our moms had no problem purchasing gorgeous mercury glass pieces from Pottery Barn that they knew could be incorporated into their home d cor when the wedding was over. My sister-in-law Natalie and I searched through old antique shops downtown Ottowa, Illinois for vintage books for table decorations. She would surprise me with new finds whenever I saw her until we had quite the collection! As soon as a family friend decided to cut down his birch tree, my dad was the first person he called! We collected an entire truckload and used it for numerous details throughout our ceremony and reception (you can see birch bark candles, picture frames, flower cones, logs, etc.). My aunt gave us countless numbers of skeleton keys that she had collected. It was amazing to see how generous and motivated people were to lend a helping hand to the aesthetics of our big day! '

S'We re back with a big heaping, second scoop of Heather Cook Elliott Photography, and this afternoon she s teamed up with Tailored Engagements on a wedding that is every bit as beautiful as it is romantic. From the bridesmaids in pink, to the linens from BBJ, to the couple themselves, every bit of this day was perfect.'
p4102
aS'From the photographer  Christine & Todd already have a long & winding love story that starts with them becoming best friends in college at Marquette in Milwaukee. It took awhile for them to realize that best-friendship would equal partnership, but once it hit home it really hit home. For the last several years they have lived in his hometown of Chicago where Christine worked downtown and Todd commuted an incredible 70 miles to work and back to her because where she is is where he needs to be. Todd played final four basketball at Marquette, professionally in Europe and is taking the lead in spiriting the two of them off on a new adventure as he recently accepted a new coaching position at a university. And Christine is happy to accompany him, even though it might mean passing the bar in a new state. '
p4103
aS'Christine & Todd, together and individually, are quite possibly the nicest people I have ever met. They both have huge hearts and know   really know   the meaning of family and its importance. Christine s sister recently found out she has cancer and was undergoing treatment soon before the wedding. Thankfully she was up to the task of being a matron of honor despite the treatment and was by Christine s side throughout the day. Todd s birth and adopted family held him up throughout the wedding, as well, as Todd & Christine formed their own loving, time and trial tested family. I'
p4104
aS' have to write just a bit about the styling of the day as I was consistently struck by how beautiful, tasteful, delicate and inspired everything was from shoes to flowers, to treats, to music and of course to the gorgeous florals. I loved Christine s two belts, Todd s classically embroidered cuffs and I could shoot a pink and gold wedding with the stunning architectural backdrop that is the Milwaukee Art Museum every day of the week. My favorite part of the day was when Christine & Todd took a few moments alone amongst the  ribs  of the MAM s architecture. He lifted her up onto a ledge and moved close to her. She kicked off her Jimmy Choos and just breathed him in. It was magical   just like their story and their love.'

S'Lovlies, we have quite the treat for you today. It starts with this Wisconsin soiree which somehow manages to be elegant and chic and casual and warm all at once, and it ends with yet another dose of Heather Cook Elliott Photography this afternoon. Yep, you heard me. Two beautiful weddings that our lady Heather captured phenomenally, because we re big fans. First up, we ve got love on a lake.'
p4201
aS'From the photographer  Maria & Dave have a magnetism about them that draws everybody in   into conversation, into laughter, into their lives, into something special. Their wedding day was a testament to that magnetism   and to how full their lives are now and how impossibly full they will grow to be. On a sunny day in June they met on a dock, in the wind and said I love you. I can t wait to marry you. That wind played with Maria s veil and their favorite people laughed and cheered them on (as did many boaters motoring by during the lake side ceremony) and they just sort of melted into a perfect day to say I Do. '
p4202
aS'I adore their easy style that is at once down home and rustic, but a bit refined and frilly. Maria DIY d many things and basically thought of everything to keep guests happy. I ve never seen so many children at a wedding   30 or more   who played with their kid entertainment treat bags and begged for pictures with Maria & Dave. I caught a glimpse of two cousins playing at wedding (the  groom  opted to wear a Spider Man mask) after dinner and more smiles than I could count in every direction I looked. Maria carried a dragonfly pin on her bouquet to memorialize a beloved cousin of Dave s who died of cancer too young at 16 and her earrings were her grandmother s   the family matriarch, loved and revered and recently passed. But the atmosphere was jovial and sweet and celebratory   both of Maria & Dave, but also of the family members that had made them who they are today.'
p4203
aS'When it was time to dance Maria and Dave shared a sensual, sweet, totally romantic moment where I think everyone in attendance saw what real love looks like when it decides to dance. I have a feeling Maria & Dave dance together a lot, just the two of them, alone in a room full of people.'

Especially when you add in the ever-amazing Stacy Able, who frolicked around every Chicago hotspot (5 miles!) with these two sweethearts to capture some serious love-filled images.  See them all right here.'
p4229
aS'From Stacy Able Photography  Natalia is a new resident of Chicago from Canada. The couple met at Law School in Michigan. To show off her new city, their downtown Chicago engagement session highlighted many elements of famous Chicago downtown architecture. We started near the exchange building, which I recognized from my W New Years Eve wedding, and worked our way to the beautiful Chicago Lakeshore parks. One inner city courtyard was particularly special as the two often meet up for lunch dates. Likely we walked a good 5-6 miles seeing various buildings, art, and capturing this adorable couple s images along the way. I m looking forward to their summer 2014 wedding at the Patrick C. Haley Mansion in Joliet, Illinois.'
p4230
aS'From the Bride-to-be  We met in law school. We had many classes together. We became friends quickly and eventually started dating. Alek proposed Christmas Eve in front of the Christmas tree after we all finished opening presents. He knows how much I love Christmas and so he thought it would be a good time to pop the question. My family was visiting from Canada and they were there to witness the event. They didn t know he was proposing until a few minutes before it actually happened. I m so happy I got to share that special moment with them.'
p4231
aS'We chose downtown for pictures, because it s such a beautiful city that it would be a shame not to showcase it. We are kind of new to downtown living and we thought it would be a perfect way to capture our period of downtown life in our engagement pictures. I also thought it would be interesting for both of our families who live overseas to have a glimpse of Chicago!'

S'Stopping my day to soak in every last ounce of pretty from this woodland bridal shoot didn t take a lot of convincing.  In fact, it took absolutely no convincing at all.  Because when you combine the pure talents of some of Illinois  finest vendors (think Amanda s Bake Shoppe, Petals n  Bloom Special Event Florist, The Constant Scribe and many, many others) against a breathtaking backdrop like the Pleasant Valley Conservation Area, it s an inspiration home run.  Ready to get lost in all of the beauty?  See every last moment captured by Elizabeth Greve right here in the full gallery.'
p4265
aS'We were inspired by the natural raw feel the conservation area provided us and by the serenity and simplicity of this location. The old stones of the amphitheater provided a solid and strong foundation  like a good marriage should have. We pulled colors and shapes from the flowering red bud and burr oak tree canopies. These spring colors seem so vivid and awakening after a long dull winter. We also incorporated different greenery elements of fern and moss to showcase the many varieties seeming to be bursting to life on the forest floor. To add to the rustic appeal we wanted a mixture of old and new materials reminiscent of the passing seasons.'

S'So I might be the most unpopular person in the the blogosphere for this but I m fully looking forward to winter. Because to be totally honest, I m the kind of girl who d prefer cozying up by the fireplace to laying out on the beach any day of the week. Crazy. I know. So when my favorites from Paper Antler sent over this elegant winter wedding in the dead of summer, it felt a little like Christmas morning. And if you happen to be a cold weather lover like me, I m oh-so-certain you ll be happy spending this August day right here.'
p4296
aS'From the Bride  My family s home holds some of my most precious memories so we chose its country setting to set the tone for our wedding.  We paired this country house inspiration with our reception s formal lakeside ballroom to create our French Country Formal theme.  The colors were held together by warm cream tones mixed with muted gold, as well as greyed blues and pinks.  We incorporated rich fabrics   a grandmother s fur, velvet seats in a family sleigh, and brocaded lace.  To bring the  country  into our ballroom setting, we found handcrafted wood farm tables and adorned them with loads of votive candles next to reflective pieces   silver candelabras, gold vases, and mercury glass.  To soften the tables, we introduced full florals   heirloom English garden roses, hydrangeas, peonies and hints of soft greens.'

S'This wedding is awesome.  Awesome in that it s the kind of wedding that you sort of always knew you wanted  and want each of your friends to have, too.  It s a fabulous blending of cultures with sophisticated stylings and the overwhelming love of one very amazing bride and groom.  In other words, it s Chicago perfection, all set against a glamorous Maude s locale and captured in breathtaking images by Two Birds Photography.  See them all in the full gallery.'
p4332
aS'From Two Birds Photography  This wedding was unlike most we have ever been to. The groom s father is from Bombay, India and they really wanted his heritage to be a part of their celebration. The ultimate result was incredible, and we had so much fun capturing their beautiful event!'
p4333
aS'From the Bride  Brian and I met on December 1st four years ago. It was a cold and snowy day. We were so incredibly lucky that December 1st of 2012 fell on a Saturday. What a fantastic day it turned out to be. Who would have EVER thought it would be in the sixties?!'
p4334
aS'My vision for our wedding was French meets Indian with a Bohemian vibe. I was really inspired by Kate Moss  wedding. We wanted a party not a stuffy wedding. The most important element to us was gathering our friends and family together over great food and drink. This was our opportunity to get the people who matter most in our lives in one room together for one night. Food brings people together, good food makes people happy and good drinks make them sing and dance. Almost everyone told us that the food and drinks were the best they have ever had at a wedding. And so many of our guests told us that it was the best wedding they have ever been to. We owe it all to Rebecca Royster, the GM at Maude s. She and her staff made our vision come to life. They were kind and warm and funny and overjoyed about the occasion. Scottie McNiece, Maude s music maestro made it happen with a soundtrack of old school Rap, Gypsy Jazz, Bollywood and House music. We danced the night away and as the evening ended we exchanged hugs and well wishes with our guests. The staff waived us goodbye as we walked out the door. We wouldn t have changed a single thing about that night. Thank you to everyone who made our wedding a success. And certainly to the dynamic duo of Jake and Jennifer Moreland at Two Birds Photography for capturing our moment in time.'

Where lush blooms play nice with hot pink, and dapper men in tuxes kick it up a notch with just a dash of vibrant color?  Well, lovelies  this is one of those weddings.  An ode to all things elegant with a fabulous team of vendors (+ a beautiful bride and groom) taking the reigns to ensure a a day that was, from start to finish, all about the pretty.  See every last moment captured by Kina Wicks in the full gallery.'

aS'From Kina Wicks  I absolutely loved shooting Christine & Kevin s wedding day at The Fountain Blue in Des Plaines, Illinois. The touches of pink, the very personal ceremony with traditions from both of their families and cultures and the warmth that pervaded the entire day  so great. Christine and Kevin s personalities were apparent in the little details of the day, which I love as well. '

S'You can t possibly look at this wedding and not be filled with happiness. The kind of happiness that starts at your toes and goes through every last strand of hair. This is the kind of wedding that brings you back to SMP over and over again. Because it s full of everything that makes weddings wonderful   heart, soul, gorgeous images from Momoko Photography   and it s all sitting pretty right here.'
p4464
aS'From Momoko  I wanted the description come from me, because this wedding meant a lot to me which sounds silly, but I ll explain. Meredith and Pat were my first wedding of the season and they started me off right. They couldn t have been more laid back and more kind to me and I feel like a stressful day can really bring out a lot of emotions in a person, but these two were glowing and happy and phenomenally cool. Initially, Meredith and Pat wanted to be low key and do a quick beach nuptial in Thailand. The bride s mother could not imagine her first child getting married way over in Thailand, so Meredith and Pat started planning their wedding in Chicago. They wanted a place that represented their easy going nature and fondness of beer so they chose Revolution Brewing, which you can have brew tours in the basement during cocktail hour.'
p4465
aS'Meredith is a crafter and loves to create projects and so she made all the table decorations herself, as well as the decor with the exception of the flowers around the event space. She also searched out a film photographer and that s where I came into the scene. I shot this wedding exclusively in film per her request and in addition she asked that I bring no lights so that I would not be intrusive to the guests. They really love their friends and family and thought a lot about them when they thought of the wedding.'
p4466
aS'We did not do an engagement session and when a bride that I work with does not opt for the engagement session then I like to go out for drinks or visit the couple in their home to get to know them better and that s how I learned a key element that I knew I had to capture for the wedding. The bride s father, several years earlier, had a stroke and has since had a harder time walking and using his legs. Upon knowing that his daughter was to be married, he began practicing walking on his treadmill so that he could walk his daughter down the aisle properly. I had to try hard to bite back the tears while she told me this, but those are the details that make a wedding so special and is why I photograph.'
p4467
aS'I left this wedding feeling like I did what I love and was a part of something genuinely beautiful. Meredith and Pat truly are better together. '

We had a blast photographing these two together and can t wait to photograph their wedding in July. They will be married at the Chicago Botanical Gardens and shortly depart for Argentina for more missionary work! '

S'If there s one thing I ve learned from poring over dozens upon dozens of weddings here on SMP, it s this: personalization is key to the perfect day. I m talking about weddings that feel thoughtful and authentic; where, if nothing else, guests can walk away saying,  That was so them.  And this Midwest affair fits that bill to a pretty little T. Erin Jean Photography captured every eclectic-loving detail, and there s a million more moments to be swooned sitting right here.'
p4516
aS'From Erin Jean Photography Melissa and Ryan are a modern couple.  It s a love story of photographer meets teacher.  That produces a beautiful wedding.  They had gorgeous details that scream personality.  It was an urban meets vintage affair.  Dream wedding!  The grooms words were,  this is an etsy wedding!   From the bow ties to the paper elements surrounding the room, it was a handmade affair.'
p4517
aS'From the Bride and Groom  Like any other couple anxiously awaiting the day they finally get to marry the one person who makes their heart sing, Melissa and Ryan had a definite vision for their wedding day. Luckily for them, that day became everything they had dreamed and more. Their picturesque Milwaukee wedding landed (coincidentally) on the first day of summer, and after heavy rains and thunderstorms pushed through, their big day became one for the books. '
p4518
aS'Ryan, a musician and history teacher, and Melissa, a photographer and graphic designer, could not have selected a more beautiful venue for the day, historic Turner Hall Ballroom, a local and national landmark, built in 1882. Decorated in an eclectic but simple taste, they wanted the celebration to truly represent them as a couple. Making use of antiques they have been collecting since they ve met, the assortment of their own vintage pieces merely enriched the distressed, but elegant environment of Turner Hall. The couple wanted to focus their wedding around local and handmade goods that would make their day one of a kind, including the handmade lace wedding dress, paper goods designed by the bride, and antique windows and picture frames painted and labeled with signage and seating arrangements. '
p4519
aS'Surrounded by the people that mean the most to them, the couple exchanged vows in a succinct ceremony officiated by their good friend, heard music performed by the groom s bandmates, and dined on a vegetarian meal catered by Beans and Barley, a local vegetarian and vegan-friendly restaurant and market. They also provided the rustic floral arrangements of wildflowers on each table, as well as the delicious vegan red velvet wedding cake. Erin Jean Photography beautifully captured this stunning event.'

I can t help but get all warm and fuzzy when the look at each other. The way she smiles at him is pretty much the sweetest thing in the whole wide world. You re going to love them!'
p4581
aS'From the groom  Rea and I were officially introduced when I was urged by friends to ask her to the Junior Prom. I was told it would be a good idea to ask her, even though I barely knew her. Who knew it would blossom into the relationship it has. We quickly formed a bond around our love for one another and close family and friends. It s hard to explain our relationship in a few words but we know we have something special and we don t take it for granted.'
p4582
aS'We were a bit overwhelmed when looking for a cinematographer, along with wedding planning in general, but Steve and Ton-Essa made it easy. From the initial meeting to the end of our party they made us feel comfortable and assured that our movie would be fantastic. We can t express how we felt when we saw the final film. It brought us right back to our wedding day. We literally watched it about 20 times in the first few days and it got better every time. The quality, music, and moments captured were second to none.'

Let that image soak into your head for a moment, and then start to scroll through the stunning images from Olivia Leigh Photographie below to see it come to reality. The result is just pure perfection from start to finish with one adorable couple adding to the sweetness, and you can see it all right here.'
p4629
aS'From the Bride  It was really easy to tell in the beginning stages of our relationship that my husband was a keeper. He is truly an amazing man   kind and patient, a sweetheart that helps with household chores, touches base regularly throughout the day just to see how I m doing and randomly asks  Are you happy? What can I do to make this relationship better?  Having just recently celebrated our first year of marriage, there s still the occasional squabble over dirty socks left strewn about, but I love my husband even more fiercely today and am truly thankful to have found my life s partner.'
p4630
aS'Looking back at the wedding-planning phase, I am still blown away and completely humbled by how overwhelming the process could be at times. Generally speaking, I d say my then-finance and I were a pretty resourceful and well-organized team; we had traveled the world together, lived abroad, stretched ourselves professionally and personally   but I m not going to lie, there were times I thought we weren t going to make it. We laugh about it now, but I vividly remember a teeny-tiny moment when I thought it d be easier to call the whole thing off than to effectively verbalize the type of overall feel we were hoping for   which ended up being something along the lines of  an intimate, yet elegant garden-like affair , but started off as  uh, we would like some pretty flowers please. '
p4631
aS'The staggering amount of details and decisions that comes with a wedding is enough to make any sane person weep, but from the get-go it felt like we were fighting an uphill battle trying to plan a wedding in Chicago from Philadelphia   and then the big bomb, the city announced it would be hosting the 2012 NATO Summit that same weekend. Then began the all-out scramble to understand and address any and all logistically nightmares that the added security presented including rerouting vendors and guests through and around closed streets and protests groups, and being moved to another part of our venue for the cocktail hour because the Secret Service needed to prep the room for a luncheon the next day.'
p4632
aS'But in the same way life would not be the same without Mac by my side, our wedding weekend would not have been the most beautiful and incredible time of our lives had it not been for our team of the most-talented and wonderful vendors. Our ceremony/reception took place in the Preston Bradley Hall at the Chicago Cultural Center   a breathtakingly beautiful space; where when we first walked through during the hunt for the venue our moms collectively clapped, gasped and held each other s hands. '
p4633
aS'We loved how our officiant Pastor Bill Yaccino really took the time to get to know us as a couple so that the ceremony felt very personal and intimate for us and our +200 guests. Our floral designer, Kate McCollum of K.La Designs really went above and beyond, bringing the already spectacular space alive with her creations. Scott Reichelsdork of J&L Catering not only elevated the level of dining service, but really was a much appreciated calming presence given the extraordinary circumstances of the NATO Summit weekend. We could not have imagined a more excellent way to celebrate with our friends & family than with the incredibly phenomenal Kristin Marks of Toast & Jam, who kept the dance floor packed ALL NIGHT! And the unifying force behind it all, Darcey Lohman of Big City Bride who was our planner-extraordinaire and truly a godsend. It was the best weekend of our lives and we will be forever grateful to Olivia Leigh (our photographer) and Chris + Oliver (our cinematography team), for being part of our celebration and for capturing all the details, precious moments, and all-around magic so beautifully.

S'Kristin La Voie is awesome.  She really, really is.  She s sweet, funny and talented  and sends us some of the most amazing weddings you ll ever lay your eyes upon.  Like this stunner of day held at the Bridgeport Art Center in Chicago, a classic meets contemporary gem with details that will leave you speechless and a love-filled vibe that is all kinds of romantic.  Chock-full of fabulous?  Oh, yes  yes it is. See it all right here.'
p4673
aS'From Kristin La Voie  There is nothing quite like this Bridgeport Art Center wedding in Chicago, Illinois. Amy and Brad are the sweetest couple on the planet, and their wedding was a proven fact that good things happen to good people. Their wedding was detailed to a T; from the amazing paper flower backdrop at the ceremony, Amy s Vera Wang dress with gorgeous rosettes, the girls amazing one shoulder dresses, the beautiful pictures at University of Chicago, gorgeous centerpieces and flowers on spectacular tables capes, and pretty little Kate Spade flats to top it off. All of their family and friends were there to help them celebrate and turn it into one of the most amazing weddings I ve experienced. SO happy for Amy and Brad! '

S'Anyone that knows me knows one thing: I am obsessed with libraries.  I mean, one room after another filled with a plethora of never-ending knowledge + history housed in a beautiful building?  It s magical. And since I also happen to have a slight obsession with weddings (read: a huge obsession), a wedding held in a library is basically my favorite thing (ever).  And this gorgeous day captured perfectly by Evan Hunt Photo?  It s amazing  with a breathtaking backdrop (but of course), lush florals from Parrott Party Productions and two people in l.o.v.e.  See it all in the full gallery.'
p4719
aS'From Evan Hunt Photo  Kaleigh and Bill s wedding day represents the very reason why we love photographing love stories. Their story is undeniably strong and evident in their kindness, love for each other, and faith in God. Their wedding reflected this with simplicity, elegance, and an ease to the day that only comes with confidence with a couple who is truly in love. We can t thank them enough for allowing us to capture their story and we wish them the best for their future!'
p4720
aS'From the Bride  After asking my Father for permission over a cigar in Florida, William proposed to me on December 10th, 2011 in a romantic night helicopter ride over the city of Chicago. As we flew over the city that watched our relationship grow; under the heavens that will guide our life together, he was ready to ask my hand in marriage. A suburban boy and a Chicago girl. Two very different paths crossed and resulted in the most amazing years of our lives. '

S'When it comes to throwing magical weddings, this darling duo really knows how it s done.  I mean, they reallllly know how it s done.  Because not only did they pick one of the coolest venues around to hold their festivities (the Ravinia Festival), they hired an amazing team of vendors to bring their rustic meets awesome dream to a total reality.  I m talking the planning prowess of North Shore Weddings & Events, the fab stylings and florals of Ivan Carlson and the photographer extraordinaire Olivia Leigh Photographie (just to name a few) all coming together to create one can t miss, seriously stunning affair. Get your pretty on right here.'
p4765
aS'From the Bride  Ravinia was the perfect mix of rustic beauty, musical inspiration and architectural history for our wedding in March 2013. The location was the inspiration for the wedding design and overall set the tone for the wedding. We both wanted the feel of an outdoor wedding without it actually being outdoors (Chicago Springs can still be chilly). Ravinia was the perfect location with its open grounds completely empty for our event (a normally VERY crowded music festival all to ourselves!!). The ceremony and reception both took place in Ravinia s main building with floor to ceiling windows using the outdoor trees and landscape as the ceremony backdrop. It was the perfect quiet oasis for our Rustic, Simplistic, and Elegant Wedding. We chose muted spring tones of pale green, white and gray which felt very simplistic yet elegant. We brought in the rustic elements through the use of branches, wood, and lanterns seen throughout the ceremony and reception. All these elements were reflections from the landscape of Ravinia.'
p4766
aS'Ravinia has a fabulous mixture of contemporary architecture and historical character in it s buildings. As an Interior Design Major in college, I have a passion for beautifully designed spaces. We used the entire grounds for photography. The historic buildings in Ravinia provided not only richness to the photography, but it brought in my husband s love for music. We expanded on the musical inspiration by having the song  Your Hands in Mine  by Explosions in the Sky, specially scored and played by a full band as the processional music. The song added a contemporary element to the rustic surroundings and was truly authentic to our event.'
p4767
aS'The main details to bring into focus: the AMAZING mix of silver and bronze lanterns that lined the entire ceremony aisle. This brought romance to the space while still keeping that clean simplistic look and feel we wanted. The gorgeous dark drift wood centerpiece with beautiful white peonies at the head table. Our guest table centerpieces with a mix of white and green floral with a touch of curly willow accents. Tree branch gobo projection on the dance floor and curly willow stage backdrop.  Customized chalkboard menu and sweet table sign.  Our beautiful textured cake placed on top a round wood table accented with botanical elements. This was a great mix of the simple and rustic feel we were going for.'
p4768
aS'Our main focus with all these details was to take full advantage of the amazing seamless view we had to the outdoors. Out interior and exterior became one!!'

S'Have I told you all before how much I love Chicago weddings? I have? Well, I m going to profess my love for them again today, because after seeing this beauty from Riverbend Studio and Barbara Moss Events I simply can t contain myself. It s elegant, yet comfortable, city chic, yet warm at the same time. It s everything I love about Chicago weddings wrapped up in one lovely post, and it s all sitting pretty right here.'
p4816
aS'Our wedding was a reflection of everything we loved: our recessional to Bob Dylan s  I Want You;  our first look on the hotel s terrace overlooking the Chicago River we had walked along twelve years earlier on one of our first dates; a trolley ride through Chicago with our wedding party; and most of all, our friends and family gathered in one place.'
p4817
aS'David and I come from different religious backgrounds, and our wedding honored and reflected our traditions, faiths, and customs. Our ceremony was a vision of how we will incorporate our religious differences into our shared life in the future. It was jointly-officiated by a minister and a rabbi who blended our beliefs into a beautiful ceremony. In our wedding program we explained the significance of several meaningful elements: our interfaith ketubah, my parents  wedding prayer, the chuppah, the koufeta- our Greek table favors, and the Seven Blessings.'
p4818
aS'We surrounded ourselves with memories of our families under the chuppah. My mom made me a handkerchief from the lace of her wedding gown, and we wrapped it around my bouquet. I placed pictures of both of my sets of grandparents on their wedding days into my grandma s signature locket and carried that with my bouquet, as well. David wore his late dad s cuff links and was married with his dad s ring.'
p4819
aS'Our vendors were spectacular. They made our space beautiful, kept the party dancing all night, made sure every detail was perfect from start to finish, and captured all the excitement, emotion, and happiness in photos and on film. We remain grateful to all our vendors. It is also absolutely imperative to thank Style Me Pretty for the hours of enjoyment and inspiration their blog has provided (and still provides!). Thank you!'
p4820
aS'David was an incredible partner in wedding planning. Because we made all decisions together, the day was wonderful and truly ours. Exercising the best advice we received during the planning process, we spent our entire wedding side by side. To pass on good advice: In the excitement and craziness of the day, it s easy to get pulled in opposite directions. Your wedding day will be amazing, make sure you spend it together. '

S'When it comes to fashion for the modern bride, the only rule is that there are none. From stripes to sparkles and everything in between, we re always giddy to see a bride step outside the white and ivory box. So the second we got our hands on this sweet St. Louis elopement   with a bride who rocked a glittering Badgley Mischka from Rent the Runway   we knew it d be filled with style moments to the max. Megan Thiele Studios was there to document all the  I do  goodness, and the full gallery? It s the only place to be.'
p4853
aS'From Megan Thiele Studios On a romantic Wednesday in early June, in historic Forest Park in St. Louis, Olivia and Baris were married in front of 13 of their closest friends and family.  They met at Washington University, and decided to take a non-traditional yet glamorous approach to their wedding.  Olivia sparkled in a gold Badgley Mischka gown, holding a bouquet of white peonies, while walking the path to meet her groom right before the ceremony; you could see her classic red lips smiling a mile away. They said their vows in a short ceremony next to a reflecting pool in front of the Jewel Box, a 75-year-old Art Deco greenhouse, accompanied by a few sprinkles, a couple of ducks, and a bunny in the shrubs nearby.  Once their union was made official, all 15 persons had a photo taken to commemorate the event, they shared a toast, and the bride and groom set off to take photos with their two dogs, Argon and Shirley.  The day ended with a warm summer shower and radiant smiles; a lovely story to share with generations to come.'

Which was surely the case with this wedding at The Ivy Room Chicago. It s understated elegance at its very finest all captured beautifully by Robyn Rachel Photography, and you can see every last gorgeous moment right here, in the full gallery of images.'
p4886
aS'From the Bride Whenever my husband and I get asked how we met we always laugh and respond  it s a long story.  The story is we met 8 years ago on a college spring break trip with our friends and knew right away our spring break fling was something more and that we had found the one. Our friends to this day do not let us live the story down that  what happened on spring break didn t stay on spring break  which made for fun reminiscent rehearsal dinner toasts! I was lucky that 8 years after we met on a beach in Florida, my husband proposed to me in Chicago using my grandmother s diamond which made it all the more special.'
p4887
aS'The feeling of our wedding that our family and friends kept describing to us was  understated elegance  and that is exactly what we were going for! We wanted a wedding that would best reflect our relationship of being timeless and traditional, but also fun loving, romantic, and something fresh. We chose to get married at the Ivy Room Chicago as it was important to both of us to have the ceremony outside, but also be located in the heart of our favorite city and home near all of the action. Our officiant was from my church in the suburbs where I have gone my whole life so even though we were not in that particular space it was nice to have a piece of it there with us that day. We absolutely loved all that the Ivy Room had to offer and tried to compliment it with soft pinks (using peonies my favorite flower) and champagne colors and focus on candles and lighting. We wanted to make sure every detail was perfect, yet at the same time did not want to get carried away with too many little things and lose sight of what we were there for. This was especially evident in our guestbook which was done by our photographer to be a book of all of our engagement photos as the pages and our guests could write messages on top of the photos. We really loved how she wanted to capture and show our personality as a couple in both our engagement and wedding photos for our love for each other, Chicago, and our friends and family. '
p4888
aS'One thing that brought my husband and I together is the importance of the people in our life. We are close with our families, but also consider our friends to be family, as you can see by our large bridal party! We didn t want to leave out anyone out in sharing in our day, even my niece as the flower girl who had to be carried down the aisle at just 9 months old! '
p4889
aS'We were so happy when the Chicago weather cooperated and allowed us to have the perfect day! It was really meaningful to us to have so many family and friends who had come to know our relationship so well over the past 8 years be there to support and celebrate and not leave our side on the dance floor for the entire evening! Everything was absolutely perfect and we wish we could relive the weekend all over again.'

S'Cristina G Photography has been the reason for a lot of happy moments here at SMP.  A lot of stop-you-in-your-tracks, take your breath away happy moments overflowing with smiling faces and bundles upon bundles of pretty.  We adore her.  So spending our day adding to her ever-growing list of amazing? Awesome.  Especially when it s a beautiful Chicago affair with a hot pink twist on tradition that boasts gorgeous blooms from Avant Gardenia and a stunning cake from La Petite Sweet.  See it all right here in the full gallery.'

aS'From the Bride  Shane and I  met  on a pen-pal website called interpals, exactly five years ago to the day. Neither of us were looking to start a relationship at the time, least of all with someone who lived four thousand miles away  and yet somehow that is exactly what ended up happening. Shane had just finished college at the time, and, never having gone more than a couple hundred miles from his hometown in Ireland, was looking to do some traveling before starting work. He expressed some interest in visiting the states, and asked me if I had any recommendations on where to go. I of course told him he had to see Chicago, and jokingly mentioned that I would put him up in my college dorm room if he ever decided to visit, never in a million years thinking that anything would ever come of it. Little did I know.'
p4919
aS'Four years into our relationship Shane proposed during an all too short trip to Chicago for the Christmas holidays.  Five days later he returned to Ireland, and I would not see him again for the following six months. During this time I threw myself into wedding planning and (more importantly) visa paperwork. We didn t set out planning our wedding with a particular theme in mind. We knew we wanted something  classic and elegant,  but as far as colors and styles went, we were pretty much open to anything. What was most important to Shane and I, was that our wedding be an unforgettable party, with good food, drinks, music and dancing all taking top priority. Everything else it seems, just sort of  fell into place. '
p4920
aS'Having so many of our family and friends together  for our wedding was an absolutely amazing experience, and one we ll never forget. It was so special and humbling to be surrounded by so much love and support. We could not have asked for a more perfect day and will be forever grateful for all of the memories made!'
p4921
aS'From Cristina G Photography  Maddie and Shane were married on a gorgeous April day at one of the most elegant (member only) venues in downtown Chicago   Woman s Athletic Center. Maddie envisioned the grand ballroom decorated with lush, spring flowers in beautiful sherbet tones that complimented the colors in the room to perfection. She worked with the incredibly talented Jenna Sprengel of Avant Gardenia to bring her vision to life. Stunning shades of pink were used in the floral arrangements to accent the bridesmaids  fuchsia dresses as well as other soft spring colors such as peach, light green, and yellow. A variety of lush spring floral were mixed together to create the bouquets and centerpieces, which were made in elegant silver pedestal bowls to accent the rich and classic venue. The floral scheme included peonies, ranunculus, hellebores, garden roses, lisianthus, sweet pea, astilbe, hyacinth, tulips, and dusty miller. Maddie s mermaid style lace dress was a unique Maggie Sottero design. Working with them was a photographer s dream   such a sweet couple   so in love you could feel it!'

S'When I woke up this morning, I noticed that there was the sweetest hint of autumn in the air. Just a hint. Now, by no means am I wishing away summer, but it did make me excited for things to come. Foliage, boots, an excuse to get cozy   it s just a fabulous time of the year, so this sweet anniversary session from Button to Bliss Photography is fulfilling my need for all things fall this morning, and you can get cozy with all the cuteness right here.'
p4947
aS'From Button to Bliss Photography Pictured here are two of my best friends.  Ali, I have known pretty much my whole life, and I ve gotten to know her husband Matt more and more since they started dating.  Ali and Matt were married August of  09 and didn t really do the whole formal engagement pictures thing and since, haven t had any photos taken together.  A while back Ali and I made a deal, she is an amazing hair stylist and we agreed to trade services!  We both love each others work so why not take advantage of each other!  So, last fall, right at the time of our town s annual Pumpkin Festival (Morton, IL is the Pumpkin Capital of the World!!), I spur-of-the-moment asked Ali if she and Matt wanted to head over to the festival and take some pictures.  It was perfect!  Our favorite time of year wrapped up in a package of romance!  I even got on the ferris wheel with them   fyi I almost fell out with my camera bag trying to get the perfect shot!  But it was worth it!  A month later we finished our session in the many fields surrounding our town.  We got all  American Gothic  and explored the countryside right at the golden hour. What resulted was a great experience for all of us my beautiful friends are so madly in love   even more than when they got married year years ago.'

S'We ve seen it time and time again: when an entire family combines talents to create some wedding magic, it s a downright amazing thing.  Especially when you are this fabulous family, a group of pom pom makin , paper goods craftin  lovelies who really know a thing or two about delivering the pretty.  From the sweet homemade favors to the vintage meets eclectic decor to the devastatingly gorgeous images captured by the bride s sister and brother-in-law (the crazy cool Wright Photographs), it s a day that will most definitely go down in SMP history.  See for yourself in the full gallery.'
p5001
aS'From the Bride  Our whirlwind courtship was followed by a long engagement; but after two and a half years our day was finally here.  As it turned out, my family and I needed every minute of that time to plan the wedding of our dreams.  Drew and I are blessed to be members of families who are very close and firmly rooted in love.  We knew from the beginning that our families would be very involved. Our first task was booking the church.  This particular church was chosen for a very special reason, Mann s Chapel, built in 1857, is a beautiful one room church in the country near Rossville, IL.  My parents were married at Mann s Chapel nearly thirty years before and my sister, Kelsey and her husband, Blaine, followed 24 years later, with me as her maid of honor.  '
p5002
aS'The next decision was an easy one as well.  Ironically, I had known my photographer my entire life.  My photographer, my confidante, my role model, my best friend, my sister  Kelsey.  Kelsey Wright and her husband, Blaine, owners of Wright Photographs, are a creative and vibrant young couple who happen to be very much in love.  I knew they would capture the love that Drew and I have for each other in a very intimate and personal way and that Kelsey s love for me would also spill into the photos.  The problem was that I not only wanted Wright Photographs to capture my wedding day but I also couldn t imagine our day without my sister by my side as my matron of honor.  We would later find out that my sister would be six months pregnant at the time of our wedding.  I was worried Kelsey would be overwhelmed with all of her duties but she readily accepted the challenge of playing both roles.'
p5003
aS'My mom, sisters, and I set about scouring garage sales, estate sales, flea markets, and family members  garages for the items I planned to use to decorate the church and reception venue.  The mason jars were as close as our basement.  My mom raises a large garden and loves to can the fruits and vegetables she raises each year.  The band for the reception was booked early as well.  Kelsey and Blaine has discovered a band at a wedding they shot in Indianapolis and thought they would be the perfect choice for my reception.  Endless Summer Band is amazing!  With non stop energy and music that appeals to all ages they kept everyone on their feet.  It s impossible to have anything but fun with this band in the house.  '
p5004
aS'My family and Drew joined in to help with decoration making.  We made all sizes of tissue paper poms, pinwheels, signs, and tags.  My mom put in late nights making over 1,800 yarn poms to throw as we exited the church.  My grandma and her two sisters even helped with that project!  Our favors were a labor of love as my mom made over 100 jars of homemade jams and jellies. So, after the last yarn pom was wound, the last pinwheel tied, and no detail left unnoticed or unplanned, surrounded by our family and friends, we walked down the aisle and celebrated our love for one another.  And it was perfect!'

Because not only did he plan the perfect proposal, he was smart enough to have Ann & Kam waiting in the wings to captured every sweet, priceless moment. Which is genius in the land of proposals. Because now these two cuties will have gorgeous images to look back on for years and years that will bring them back to the moment she said yes, and that s just fabulous. See it all here.'
p5022
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema Recently, Chris and Lexi visited Chicago for a weekend getaway. They thought they d see some friends, see the sights, and enjoy the city.  But Lexi couldn t understand why Chris wanted to go out for a nice dinner their first night here, or why he was so willing to get dressed up, or why he wanted to go to Navy Pier right away.  She was ready to relax and enjoy some Chicago pizza, but no, not Chris.  In fact, Chris had been acting funny all day. Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20.  And when Chris got down on one knee and pulled that little box out of his pocket, suddenly everything made sense.  Chris asked, and Lexi said yes, and everything was Perfect. Kamran and I were so honored to capture Chris s proposal to Lexi at Navy Pier during their visit to Chicago! We had such a great time hearing their story and getting to know them.'

aS'From Studio Starling Heather and Ian s springtime wedding was lovingly ablaze.We met up with them at the Renaissance Hotel for getting ready and the first look. We were lucky with a gorgeous spring day. On the terrace of the Renaissance Hotel another bridal party was having pictures made. Ian preferred to have a private first look, so we found a secluded nook on the terrace where he could see his bride for the first time. It turned out to be a great spot with a lovely view of the Chicago theater and the river.'
p5058
aS'We then traveled to a spot we ve always wanted to go to with a bridal party. Heather and Ian trusted our suggestion, so we went to the beautiful Jens Jensen redesigned Douglas Park. Although the park is in a bit of disarray, there is no denying the beauty of the park and it s architecture. The bridal party had a great time playing for our cameras and the bright colors of their flowers and clothes helped our pictures pop. Heather gave the most photogenic gestures naturally and Ian s eyes sparkled each time he looked at her. Their relaxed nature and love of each other shows in every image we made. On our way back to the venue, Room 1520, we stopped at a few industrial looking spots in the West Loop for more pictures.'

aS'When we arrived, the venue was glowing with color! LOLA event productions and Exquisite Designs really made the place gorgeous. Bright magenta and blue everywhere really made the place sparkle and showed the love of the couple.'

We were inspired by the fresh and crisp, bright colors of summer   especially our favorite combinations of bright coral accented by a muted teal, gold, and ivory.  We collaborated with an amazing team of talented vendors from Madison, WI who are true artists in the field.  One of our favorite spots just a short drive outside of Madison is this beautiful old mill in a small town near the Sugar River.  It serves as an elegant yet understated backdrop for these beautiful models and design.  We are so excited with the outcome   enjoy!'

aS'From the Bride-to-Be  Lue and I first met in Hawaii during our first year of college. Our love for each other really blossomed later when we reconnected after a couple years apart. We were mad about each other and endured a long distance relationship during Lue s stint in the Army. When Lue s time in the service ended, he moved to Chicago so that we could finally be together. The past few years have been the happiest times of our lives and we look forward to beginning a wonderful new journey together.'

S'We re big fans of all parties in the wedding category, including a fabulous inspiration shoot. But what you are about to see is something that warmed my heart like no other soiree has ever done. White Dress Events and Jamie May Photography set out to pull together a gorgeous shoot, inspired by the 1920 s   already a good start. But when they found a very deserving couple (a must read, see below) to act as models, they turned the whole shindig around and threw this lovely bride a surprise vow renewal. September s Bride gussied her up right, and her husband of twenty years couldn t stop smiling. You won t be able to either, after one look here.'

aS'From the planner  I fell in love with the Felt Mansion the first time I saw it. It is such a gorgeous estate with a long history. That is why when Jamie May Photography asked me if I wanted to do a photo shoot together I said  Yes  if it is at the Felt Mansion. '
p5194
aS' Planning a photo shoot is a lot like planning a wedding, and given that so much time and work was going to be devoted to this shoot, I really wanted to make it count by choosing models who were a real couple and who deserved a day of pampering. Jamie and I went on the hunt. We didn t have to search too far to meet John and Tracey Weatherwax. John and Tracey have such a beautiful and inspiring love story. They just celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary (can you believe it they look so young) and NEVER had a wedding. Their story goes a bit like this: John and Tracey met right after they graduated from high school. John was headed off to the Army and Tracey was off to college but they fell in love quickly. The spent a lot of time writing letters back and forth and it was in one of those letters that John first told Tracey he wanted to marry her. After several months, John got his assignment with the Army and it was taking him to Germany. He of course did not want to leave Tracey behind so he put on his best suit and some cologne, got down on one knee and asked her to marry him on a payphone! She said yes. They were married in a civil service with only her dad and sister as witnesses. They always said that one day they would have a wedding. Well many things happened over the next 20 years that kept pushing that dream off. They spent a few years in Germany, and then headed back to the US all while Tracey was trying to finish college. Finally they decided to begin their family and unfortunately discovered that they were unable to have children. Of course this was heartbreaking for both of them but they always believed that there was a bigger plan for them. John and Tracey decided that they would adopt and became an instant family of five when they adopted their three sons all at once! You can imagine that with three busy boys, that dream of a wedding was put on the back burner for a really long time.'
p5195
aS'Fast forward to our photo shoot I knew that this photo shoot would give them the wedding photos they never had and they were so thrilled to be asked! Then I got to thinking, why not give them the wedding they never had! I shared my idea with John (of course I was going to need some help) and asked what he thought about surprising Tracey with a vow renewal ceremony. John was delighted so the planning began. Just a few family members were invited along with their pastor who would perform the ceremony. All the while, the details were kept from Tracey who still thought she was the bride in a photo shoot. Jamie and I took Tracey dress shopping and she was able to have the experience of trying on gowns and being a bride. All the vendors who were on board for the photo shoot were even more excited about this project when I shared with them the turn of events. A surprise vow renewal how fun!'
p5196
aS' The day of the photo shoot came and it was flurry of activity to get everything ready and to keep the surprise from Tracey. Now keep in mind that there was a team of about 12 people on location for the shoot and Tracey was the only one who did not know what was really going on! We went through the motions because it still really was a photo shoot. John and Tracey had a first look which was so heartwarming. Right before Tracey waked down the stairs to meet John who was waiting for her, she said to me  This makes me wish I had a wedding.  Oh, I just cried when I sent her down to meet her husband .she only had to wait about another hour and she would have a wedding!'
p5197
aS'The guests arrived secretly without being spotted, their three children arrived in their adorable Gatsby attire and it was time for the vow renewal. We gave John and Tracey a few private moments to chat and John told her he always wanted to give her the perfect wedding, he did NOT tell her what was about to happen. They walked out of the mansion and that is when Tracey saw all of her family waiting! It was the moment that made it all worth it for every single person involved. Her dad walked her down the aisle and she and John renewed their vows in front of all the guests who could not be there the first time. There was not a dry eye there! My heart is still warm just thinking about it!'
p5198
aS'Now on to the details Being that the mansion was built in the 1920 s we really wanted to create a style that complimented that time period. The Great Gatsby was our inspiration and you will see several elements from the book throughout. Skeeter Parkhouse from Eastern Floral was my partner in design! Together we created a lovely dining room scene with vintage china, gold chargers, crystal vases, towering silver candelabras and gorgeous flowers.'
p5199
aS'We set up the bar in the library. We used a variety of gold and ivory pictures frames, flowers, vintage books, suitcase and barware. The bar was complete with a Gatsby inspired drink menu.'
p5200
aS'Second Floor Bakery provided the amazing cakes we used on our dessert display. Seven different cakes in varying sizes and styles were placed on top the most beautiful mix of cake stands. Fresh flowers, ivy, and gold bird nests were tucked in around the ruffle, rosette and gold accented cakes. We used stacks of vintage china and dessert forks to complete this look. My favorite little touch is the gold frame around the forks. How cute is that?'
p5201
aS'September s Bride styled our bride from head to toe. She wore a lovely silk gown, stunning jewelry, a black faux fur and a birdcage veil. Carrie Whiting from Flawlessly Finished Event Artists made the bride beautiful with gorgeous hair and makeup. Her and her assistant arrived dressed in their own 1920 s inspired outfits. They did an amazing job! Later, the bride changed into a second set of more glamorous jewelry from What A Gem Jewelry Boutique. Stunning!'
p5202
aS'A beautiful invitation set, table number, seating cards, drink menu and my favorite, the  Our Love Story  poster were the lovely pieces created by Jamie Lynne Creative. Inspiration Video was on hand to capture this entire day and their finished video will leave you reaching for a tissue.'
p5203
aS'It was such a wonderful and inspiring day! We all walked away tired but with full hearts knowing that we gave something to this couple that they will never forget!'
