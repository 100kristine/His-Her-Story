S'Some might say it s a bit far to trek from Singapore to Provence for a engagement shoot with M&J Photography, but that s probably before they ve laid their eyes this gallery. It s what happens when you take to the lavender fields of France in late June, and the photos have convinced me to book a trip myself. Congrats, lovlies!'

aS'From M&J Photography LTD Singaporean couple John & Li Ping will get married this summer in their home city, but first they dreamed of having a pre-wedding engagement photo session in the lavender fields of Southern France. Late June in Provence was the perfect time!'
p25
aS'The famous hill top town of Gordes was a stunning backdrop for some of the first shots of the day. Further photos were taken amongst the beautiful natural surroundings of the local area and the pretty pastel coloured towns that are like hidden gems in the Luberon Valley. As the sun went down, we had the most magical light just in time to finish off a perfect evening amongst the impossibly purple rows of lavender.\n'

S'When you cross a classic-loving bride and a formal Scottish manor, you ve got a wedding that could even give Kate Middleton a little run for her money. From the exchange of vows on the marble staircase, to the regal celebration that followed, Craig & Eva Sanders photographed the swoon-worthy moments, and it s all waiting right here in the gallery.'
p77
aS'From The Bride & Groom Soon after we got engaged we always knew we wanted a spring wedding in Scotland. Our plans started out simple, we wanted a beautiful big house for our ceremony and reception. Half our guests would be traveling from England the other half from Scotland so it was really important to have the whole day in one place.'
p78
aS'The ceremony was going to be an intimate one and the venue should be a place for our friends and family to relax and enjoy the day. Followed by good food, good wine and of course, a band with whom we could dance into the wee small hours of the night.'
p79
aS'After being engaged for a few weeks, we booked the breattakingly beautiful Gosford House. The venue was everything we could have ever dreamt of and more, located near our home in East lothian, it was the perfect  Big House  for our wedding day.'
p80
aS'A traditional Scottish wedding day with little English touches, we choose the marble staircase and landing as the perfect setting for our intimate humanist ceremony. The light and space was perfect for our guests to enjoy the house and share in our own words what marriage meant to us as we had written the ceremony ourselves.'
p81
aS'With colours of peaches and cream running through the marble and the light from the glass roof filling the room, we designed our seating to complement the flow of the stairs, we wanted each of our guests to have the best seat in the house, whatever seat they chose.'
p82
aS'Our inspiration for d cor was easy, Gosford house is decorated so beautifully, original paintings fitted with gold gilt picture frames and giant antique mirrors, and we simply complemented the house by adding in lots of pretty details.'
p83
aS'Our flowers were inspired by the marble staircase   colours of coral, pink, peaches and cream. Keeping the overall look loose and unstructured, we wanted a relaxed regal feel!\n'

S'Escaping to tropical paradise with the one you love is as good as it gets. Unless, of course, it involves a wedding celebration with all your dearest friends and family at Dreams Los Cabos. Then it s EVEN better. That s exactly how Howard and Suzanne planned their destination nuptials, and thanks to Florenta Flower Design, Hana Chung Photography and a team of dream vendors, the day turned out to be one for the books.'
p100
aS'From the Bride  Howard s favorite color is turquoise and as a child I always loved the color orange. So when we decided to get married in Cabo, I thought the perfect color scheme for our wedding would be a seafoam green with a coral accent to go with the desert and the sea. After finding my dress, I knew I wanted a romantic vintage wedding filled with lace, roses and candle lights.'
p101
aS'We choose to have a destination wedding in Cabo because of its surreal, crystal clear beaches and pure romance. Cabo gave us an excuse to celebrate our marriage over an extended vacation with our closest family and friends. Dreams Los Cabos made our wedding extra special by helping us host a welcome bonfire the night before our wedding and a Mexican themed night consisting of dancers and a mariachi band the night after our wedding.'
p102
aS'One of the highlights from our wedding happened days later when we decided to do our own version of  trash the dress  by going horseback riding in our wedding attire. Cabo was a beautiful destination! We are so grateful to Dreams Los Cabos and all the vendors who made our wedding day one we will never forget.\n'

S'A week-long celebration in Punta Cana topped off with a wedding more gorgeous than I could ever put to words sounds pretty darn lovely, no? Well just take a little peek below and you will see that was just the case. And even prettier if you can imagine that. Captured by ShoeBox Photography, this gallery is the definition of gorgeous. See what I mean here.'
p127
aS'We knew we wanted to spend an entire week with our friends and family as oppose to a single day which is famously known to be very chaotic and nerve-wrecking, hence the decision of a destination wedding. Staying at a resort offered the convenience we were looking for, but did not exude the atmosphere we wanted for our wedding day. It needed to represent our personalities, and instantly fell in love with a stunning rustic beach bar venue I fell upon during an online search.'
p128
aS'Joel being from  the sticks  in Eastern Canada, and myself having had travelled the World and lived in 4 different countries, we decided on Bohemian Vintage, with a touch of rustic :) Our beautiful and exceptional wedding coordinator, Mayte, realized our vision perfectly, and went above and beyond. She was so excited about our vision considering our styles were very similar, she went as far as bringing her personal home decor to our wedding!!!!! I told her we could have simplified everything and have gotten married in her living room lol. Each table had it s unique spin, and had plenty to stimulate the senses!'
p129
aS'The WTOO bridesmaid dress palette turned out beautiful. I wanted a soft romantic beachy breezy look, but also knew I wanted different shades of colors. The girls could wear whichever nude shoes and earrings they preferred. We kept arms and neck bare, following the less is more concept! Joel and I saved quite a bit of money by ordering dried and bleached baby s breath flowers for the girls, and handmade boutonnieres for the men on Etsy. The bouquets wraps were each individualized (by Mayte) with a piece of excess fabric and jewels from my dress.'
p130
aS'Both my grandmothers passed during the same month in the previous year, and I wanted them to walk me down the aisle, therefore pinned a charm of each of them on my bouquet. Another small yet impactful detail was to present each of our mothers a small & elegant bouquet of flowers, with our baby pictures pinned on each.'
p131
aS'My dress was a little dramatic for the beach, but it somehow worked. I bought it at a really great price from a local wedding boutique owned by an old family friend (the owner used to buy chicken from my grandmother as a child). I had it altered down to my size and created more of a plunge in the back. It had that vintage / boho look I was going for, with a touch of glam, and I absolutely loved it.'
p132
aS'We kept everything a surprise, including the venue. The guest only knew to be ready for a shuttle pick up at the lobby for 4:15pm. They didn t know where they were going or how far they were driving and they were great sports about it! The reaction was amazing when they stepped into the venue.'
p133
aS'Our wedding party left slightly earlier. Once we hit the dirt road leading up the venue, the shuttle stopped and the bridesmaids kicked the groomsmen out. While the boys figured we were stopping for photos, seven local  motoconchos  showed up, signalled for them to hop on the back, and sped off, dirt and all, to the venue. This was all the more hilarious since most of the groomsmen drive high powered speed bikes and motorcycles! They thoroughly enjoyed it and had a really good laugh.'
p134
aS'We wanted the music to be a BIG part of the evening and had a cousin bring his guitar to play during the seating and welcome cocktail prior to the ceremony. Everyone enjoyed him so much he played during our cocktail hour as well. Another very personalized and memorable detail was having one of the groomsmen, an exceptional singer/guitar player, play our first dance while we danced in awe barefoot on the beach surrounded by our favourite people, the waves and an ocean breeze. It was all very overwhelming to say the least.'
p135
aS'Then the party began ..and shirts came off!'
p136
aS'In closing, we would not have been able to relive this day over and over again if it weren t for our amazing photographers Melinda and Rob from Shoebox Photography who rarely missed a moment and captured every detail of the day and night. We loved them.'
p137
aS'From Shoebox Photography What can be said about their day that could possibly describe it best? The bridal party were stunning, due to the lovely and talented Anna Nuet, the guys were a fantastic representation of what fun should be. This was a group of family and friends whose sole purpose was to see these two get wed in style and send them into marriage with a bang.'
p138
aS'Mayte and the Jellyfish staff always create a stunning setting but this one was above and beyond. The sheer detail in this bohemian chic & vintage theme was a photographers dream. The ceremony was sweet and funny as it always is with Pastor Rick York presiding & had a unique touch, a handmade wine box with the inscription  You ll be my glass of wine. I ll be your shot of whiskey.  France & Joel locked inside a very special bottle along with the notes they wrote each other just a few hours earlier. Down the road, they ll unlock the box when they really need the wine and notes inside! One of the most touching moments through tears by the groom as his beautiful bride walked towards him.'
p139
aS'The day and night were filled with beautifully funny speeches, and even a very special appearance by Batman. After having spent an entire day with the group it all made sense, stories that started the day as crazy were very believable by the days end. The back story with Batman is that it s a bit of an obsession for our spotlight fanatic groom. Who at times, rephrase, every chance he can, likes to dress up in a Batman costume ( usually under the influence ) and bring his brand of happiness to all. However on his wedding night the brides incredibly awesome mom stole the show when she surprised everyone by storming the event as the Batman theme song suddenly poured through the speakers. Hilarious, and utterly shocking for both the bride + groom as they had no idea who it was. Such a high note in my books. Oh, that and the duet of Ricky Marten s Livin  la Vida Loca. That too was a moment where we seriously thought we were going to drop our cameras in fits of laughter.'
p140
aS'The drinks were flowing, the dancing was fierce, fuelled by the talented  crazy hour  crew that presented their iconic fire show, merengue dancers, a capoeira performer and intricately costumed devils and clowns to kick things off right. The night took it s final turn and depending on which side you were on ( ever been one of the only sober people at a crazy party? ) the shirts and pants started to fly as they fired down shots on their sandy dance floor by the beach. It was with a heavy heart that we packed up our gear, having to turn down numerous requests to keep gettin  our dance on.\nsometimes babies suck.'
p141
aS'France and Joel will forever be in our hearts, it was such a memorable day spent with remarkable people.\n'

The joy emanating out of these images completely defines what a wedding can and should be.

Cigar boxes, vintage teacups, dahlias, peonies, proteas, David Austin s, runuculus, wax flowers, mason jars, candlelight and fire pits decorated the barn and cocktail area.'
p192
aS'Our ceremony was an intimate affair with just our closest family members in attendance. Having lost both my parents (my mom very recently to cancer), I was apprehensive about having a big wedding knowing how emotional my sisters and I would be without our mom and dad there. It was Graham s idea to have a small family only ceremony and dinner and follow it up with a big reception party at a later date and it was the best decision we ever made.'
p193
aS'How wonderful it was to be able to get ready in the Monroe family farmhouse. Getting ready with my sisters was a bittersweet moment as my mother s presence was everywhere, from the buttoning up of my lace Pronovias gown to the crowing of the haiku floral lei, I could hear her laughter and feel her love around all of us.'
p194
aS'I had my three nieces as my flower girls, my two younger nephews as my ring bearers, and my two oldest nephews (both of which are named for their grandfathers whom they never got to meet) walk me down the aisle. I know my dad would have approved of having his grandsons step in to walk his last little girl down the aisle. It was magical to have all littlest family members involved and they kept us all smiling and laughing the entire day.'
p195
aS'Graham picked our ceremony location to be in one of the upper pastures with beautiful views. Wooden benches, chaise lounges, and vintage chairs made up the seating for our small party and two garden chairs were placed in front for my parents so that Graham and I could lay flower leis over them in remembrance.'
p196
aS'Taking photos while walking through the beautiful orchards with the talented husband and wife team that make up Tamiz photography, we were able to have a few quiet moments to ourselves while the afternoon sun kissed the coming dusk.'
p197
aS'The Monroe s working rustic barn was converted into a beautiful dinner theater with hanging floral arrangements on rustic wooden planks cascading down to vintage farm tables. Linen table runners decorated with flowers and candles made for the perfect table setting. Miss B Calligraphy created the rustic wooden signs, handmade seating cards and a unique picture menu to highlight the culinary delights of Maui Executive Catering. Pan Asian cuisine with fresh farm to table deliciousness was the perfect choice for our wedding dinner. Fresh ahi poke (a local favorite), sous vide wagyu beef, and homemade green tea ice green (the groom s favorite) were just some of the dishes that were served to our guests.'

S'Let me set the scene: Lush florals from Teresa Sena Designs, glam design by Belle Destination Weddings And Events and tropical paradise at the Haiku Mill. It s the makings of this Maui destination wedding, and I for one, can t get enough. 30 guests joined in the celebration, and Tamiz Photography captured the love to a perfect T. Click here for so much more.'
p308
aS'From Belle Destination Weddings And Events Oh the romance! Jenni (an Orange County native) & Evan (from Kanasas City) first met each other when they both moved into the same building in Denver, CO in the summer of 2007. Introduced by the concierge the first week they lived in the building, the two became fast friends and it was only a matter of time before these two love birds became an item. Jenni describes it perfectly,  It was meant to be!  After dating for 5 years, Evan took Jenni on holiday to their favorite place, the gorgeous island of Maui, in November of 2012. During an early morning walk on a secluded beach, Evan got down (knee in the sand) and proposed. Jenni describes the moment as  intimate and romantic,  becoming the inspiration for their actual wedding event.'
p309
aS'The planning then began almost immediately, being inspired by different elements of the island during their stay on Maui. While walking through the lobby of their hotel, they heard 2 different musicians performing, almost setting a soundtrack for these special moments. They later requested those same two musicians, Jamie Lawrence & Clay Mortenson, who were hired on to perform for their ceremony and reception. The music re-created those amazing memories for the couple.'
p310
aS'Haiku Mill seemed like the obvious choice for Jenni and Evan.  It was the perfect venue for our small destination wedding of 30 guests. The Mill was more representative of Evan & I than a sandy beach wedding.  Jenni proclaimed.  Walking into the Mill (on the wedding day) for the first time literally took my breath away. Seeing our vision come to life was overwhelming. It exceeded all expectations. '
p311
aS'The Mill complimented the formal setting that the two was seeking. They wanted the relaxing element of a destination wedding without giving up the formality of this very special event. The week was full of enjoyable events for the couple and their guests, which included an adventurous snorkel cruise charter, as well as an intimate gathering for their rehearsal dinner at Merriman s Kapalua. This time spent with their closest friends and family prior to the wedding allowed them to catch up with their guests and truly relax and enjoy each other on the day of the wedding.'
p312
aS'The bride stunned her groom into silence when her first laid eyes on her walking down the aisle with her father. Fitted in a lace and ruffled Vera Wang gown, Jenni s smile was one of joy as she walked towards her groom to be. Evan stood stunned, tears falling, as his beautiful bride approached him. It was a magical moment that we wedding planners live for! It was as if it was out of a movie.'
p313
aS'From the bride  We could not have been luckier to work with the  best,  most talented vendors throughout our wedding planning process. With very high standards for our planning team, we were not disappointed. Jane Park led the way and ensured we were surrounded by a very honest, dependable wedding team (e.g. Maui Mira, Jamie Lawrence, Clay Mortensen, Teresa Sena Designs, Maui Executive Catering, Haiku Mill, Miss B Calligraphy, Tamiz Photography, Tino Rosete, and Signature Maui). The execution was flawless.'
p314
aS'Our vision was a mix of soft romantic shades of cr me and peach combined with the glamour of crystal and sparkly metallics. Hawaiian elements were intertwined throughout the ceremony from the traditional Hawaiian blessing to the sounds of Jaime Lawrence s unforgettable voice. Personalization down to every detail was very important to Evan & I. Our stationary designer, Rachelle Schwartz (of Wiley Valentine), played such an important role in designing our wedding  palm theme.  Additionally, she designed our coordinating menus, take-home cake boxes, signage, guest book, napkins, restroom towels, straw flags, and passed appetizer signs. Teresa Sena Designs embraced our vision and set the stage for an evening of romance and intimacy for our guests. Surrounded by flawless beauty at the Haiku Mill, our guests were in awe!\n'

S'While it would easy to talk about much I adore this bride s alternative orange wedding dress   which, trust me, I could do ALL day   there s so much more to this story. It s an impromptu elopement planned in just two weeks, and a true celebration of what love is all about. Have a read for the full story below, and don t miss your peek at the gallery from Taryn Baxter.'
p382
aS'From The Bride  Like our elopement, our love has been about living in the moment. My now husband, Paul, has been there for me through thick and thin, in sickness and in health, literally. Paul and I actually met in high school, and even went to prom together. But that was not when we fell in love. It was years later when we crossed paths on a beach that we found each other again. Despite a whirlwind of traveling apart   me in Australia, Fiji, Thailand and Europe over 3 years   him living abroad in Prague and then finishing up school in Canada   we never gave up on each other. We finally settled down in Denver,'
p383
aS'Colorado and were engaged within three months of buying our first home. Right after we got engaged we knew we wanted to make it into an adventure. We originally planned on a big wedding of all our family and friends in the northern jungles of Thailand. However, only five months later I found myself undergoing multiple biopsies and breast cancer scares.'
p384
aS'Although I was only 27, nearly all the females in my family had breast cancer at a young age. And that s when I became a previvor of breast cancer. In January 2013 I had a prophylactic double mastectomy.'
p385
aS'Paul supported me through everything and was my rock when I needed him the most. With our medical bills piling up we realized that we had to cancel our wedding in Thailand and look at different avenues. While it was a difficult time for us, it was a blessing in disguise for our wedding.'
p386
aS'Having to cancel our large wedding made us focus on the important parts of getting married. I was sad to miss the experience of having a big wedding and a bit worried that I would regret it, but once I started to take the steps I remembered why we were getting married in the first place, which is a celebration of the love we had built together. And ironically as soon as we decided to elope was when the fun began and the stress and anxiety stopped.'
p387
aS'We actually planned our elopement in two weeks. At the time of our planning my mom was vacationing in Hawaii and Paul s mom was in Scotland. Both of us do not have fathers, so we have always known we would not have a large family presence. Only three days before the wedding I told my mom we would be eloping. Despite the short notice, walking her only daughter down the aisle was monumental to her and she booked the next flight down. Having her there meant more to me than I would ever know and it was a really big moment in our relationship.'
p388
aS'Eloping became about us going on an adventure together and living in the moment. The location itself also became the inspiration. Zihuatanejo as a location was an easy decision. One of the reasons we chose Zihuatanejo is because the culture itself is about living in the moment   the locals are full of laughter and sharing happiness, having fun and relaxing. We also chose Zihuatanejo because of its variety of small, intimate boutique hotels. Also, Paul and I are big foodies so we were excited to explore the culinary variety and quality that Zihuatanejo is known for. Zihuatanejo ended up representing really what we are all about.'
p389
aS'I had scoured blogs and had been planning a big wedding for the past year so it was fairly easy to know what I did and did not want, what was important and unimportant. For me, my dress and shoes were important   I wanted to feel like a princess on my big day. For the wedding in Thailand I had originally chosen The Duchess dress by Aster and Ivy. I realized quickly that the pastel ballerina-like dress would not do the trick in such a vibrant, vivacious setting in Zihuatanejo. I knew that I wanted an untraditional dress for our untraditional wedding. Paul s favorite color is orange so looked for coral colored dresses that would have a wedding vibe to them. As soon as I found the coral and white Erin Featherston dress'
p390
aS'I knew I had found the gown of my dreams. This dress came alive, it glowed and I glowed, in the lush setting of our resort and Zihuatanejo. Plus the white ombre gave it a bridal feel without a bridal price tag.'
p391
aS'My flowers were from a local Zihuatanejo florist that we found on the corner of a side street. The senorita there was delighted and giddy to make my wedding bouquet and his boutonniere. Our only guidelines were to keep it all white and whimsical. My jewellery on the wedding day is all from little boutiques across Denver. They are classic yet whimsical, and I feel complement the vibrancy of our day s design. I did my hair and makeup myself. I have had my hair and makeup done at weddings by others in the past   I have learned what looks good and where and when to stop or add. Because it was so hot out I had to have my hair up. We added some of the baby s breath to my hair as a last-minute addition, something that added a bit more whimsy to my look.'
p392
aS'Our wedding day was really about enjoying our time together from the moment we woke up until the moment we went to bed. We spent the morning relaxing in our private pool, writing our vows, and soaking up the natural beauty of the hotel and scenery. I have been to so many wedding where the bride and groom are running around frazzled; ours was the complete opposite. We enjoyed every moment.'
p393
aS'Getting ready was also something that was unlike other weddings I have been to. I was able to take my time, reminisce with my mom, and reflect on the celebration. Not to mention, in the beauty of our suite, I felt like the most beautiful person on earth   something that I had not felt since my surgery.'
p394
aS'The ceremony itself was held on the deck at my mom s villa where Paul was getting ready. My mother walked me down the  aisle  which was a pathway between our villa and hers. Our wedding song  In the Morning  by Junior Boys was playing on the ipod dock. When I walked out on the patio he took my breath away; I was about to marry the most gorgeous man in the world. The sun was shining and we felt like we were the only people on earth, completely caught up in each other   it was surreal!'
p395
aS'We decided to conduct the ceremony ourselves so we could make it personal rather than get a stranger to speak at our extremely intimate wedding. Our plan was to each say what our definition of love and marriage was, then my mom would say a tribute and give us the rings, then we would say our vows. We got caught up in the moment and each other and forgot that my mom was supposed to speak! I started crying as soon as Paul opened his mouth and our love poured from our hearts over each other and the bays of Zihuatanejo. I remember thinking as soon as our vows began that I would not want to have a wedding any other way, with anyone else but us two standing on that deck, right then and right there. It was perfect.'
p396
aS'Our photographer was Taryn Baxter. I know Taryn from working in Victoria, Canada and have been completely obsessed with her work since. Having her there only made the day better; she made us feel totally comfortable especially for my husband who is extremely camera shy. It was fascinating to watch her in her creative zone, snapping away. You could really tell that photography is what she s meant to do, it was a beautiful thing to watch. My favorite thing about my photos is all of the little looks, laughs and details Taryn captured. She told our story.'
p397
aS'After the ceremony we headed to the cozy lounge, ordered champagne, and had some laughs. We then had a taxi take us down to the Zihuatanejo square to take pictures. We walked along a path that curled along the ocean front down to the fishing pier and town square. The waves were crashing and we had to dodge them the best we could as to not get wet. Down at the fishing pier locals stared and smirked at us while we took pictures, probably wondering why we would be taking pictures there. But to us it was beautiful and captured the true culture of Zihuatanejo.'
p398
aS'My biggest words of advice to brides is to give yourself plenty of time to get ready and never lose sight of what you want during your day. Don t forget what it s all about. One thing I would change about the wedding is to have our brothers there. Although it was nice to have a very intimate wedding, nothing compares to the support and love from your family.\n'

S'Sayulita is pure magic. Sunny, tropical, ocean views for days magic. And for a couple who wanted an intimate, zero fuss affair with a side of churros and the best dance party ever, this locale was a winner. So with fancy wedding day attire packed, loved ones in tow and Jillian Mitchell Photography enlisted to capture all the awesome, these love birds said  I Do  in true destination wedding fashion.'
p440
aS'From The Bride Entering the crazy realm of wedding planning solicited many conversations between my husband and I in terms of what was truly important to us for our special day versus what we didn t need to spend much energy on. There were many wedding traditions that didn t make sense for us, and that we didn t feel the need to participate in, and it took us awhile to realize how much control we actually had in personalizing our day in a way that made sense for us as well. When it really came down to it, what we wanted more than anything was to have a personal, intimate wedding, with little frills and zero fuss and we also really wanted a churro maker and the most intense dance party that would make anyone s toenails sore the next day. '
p441
aS'Choosing to have a destination wedding kind of forced us to think outside the box, and by default, there were so many wedding related details we couldn t possibly worry about, simply because we knew we wouldn t have access to them. While we didn t really have a theme, a consistent color palette, a bridal party, or other traditional elements, we were diehard about providing an environment for our friends and family to truly unplug, where cellphones didn t really need to be on, and one that would undoubtedly encourage everyone to slow down a bit, with the end goal being that we could all truly  live in the moment  with each other. While traveling is such a part of our identity, the need for adventure makes up an even larger percentage, and we deliberately chose a wedding location that many had to pull up a detailed map of Mexico to find, and a location we had actually never been to as well (although it had come so highly recommended by a plethora of other travel-obsessed friends, we knew wholeheartedly that it was a perfect fit for us). Beyond the wedding day being one of the most emotionally exhilarating days in this kind of out-of-body way that we ll never be able to articulate, we had invited all of our guests to our villa (that overlooked all of Sayulita and all of its wonder) for a cocktail party the night before. Seeing all of our favorite people meet for the first time and connect with one another was undoubtedly one of the most indescribable feelings that still makes us smile, months later. All of these people that we ve loved over the course of our lives were so excellent to each other, and we had a mutual sense of proudness to call all these amazing people our biggest supporters. The memories we ve collected from our  wedding adventure  in Sayulita still flood our daily lives and we still love to reminisce about  that one time we went to Mexico and got married in a place we ve never been . We STILL know exactly what those churros tasted like based on collective memory, and we still reference our dance party and the group speeches immediately followed by tequila shots. For lack of a better phrase, we wouldn t change a thing about our wedding day, it could have been more  us  if we tried. '

p456
aS'From The Bride A wedding in New York City was never an option for me; I always imagined my toes in the sand with a beautiful tulle train flowing behind me. Most importantly I always imagined a weekend of fun activities, tanning, drinking, and eating with our closest family and friends. Once I got engaged that s exactly what I planned for. My wedding weekend began with an arrival to Punta Cana or as I call it  The Mother Land . We decided to host our wedding weekend at the Hard Rock Punta Cana and let me just say it was nothing short of a blast. The day before the wedding we welcomed our guest with a private white party by one of their breathtaking pools. As a token of our appreciation each guest received a welcome bag with some useful goodies, whether they drank too much, tanned too much, or ate too much we had them covered.'
p457
aS'Choosing a wedding location was the hardest task; I knew a casual beach wedding just wasn t for me. I wanted to create a formal wedding while still keeping my toes in the sand. I also knew I didn t want limitations from a resort and I wanted to party all night long. Going offsite and getting married with an independent venue was the best decision I could ve made. Huracan Caf  is a beautiful rustic caf  nestled right off the coast, once I found this hidden gem that had just hosted one wedding prior I emailed Natalia + Mayte. They are amazing wedding planners with hearts of gold. The email went something like this   Hi, if you can give me a lighted chandelier on the beach the job is yours   To my delight they gave me that and much more, how about five chandeliers on the beach. I cried in Natalia s arms when I walked into my wedding, the magic they created I simply cannot put into words.'
p458
aS'Our ceremony was simple, understated, and breathtakingly beautiful. The sun was setting and the ocean breeze would occasionally run through my hair. We didn t realize this till it was over but we held hands throughout the whole ceremony, with 62 guest it still felt like it was just us two up there.'
p459
aS'Chandeliers, sparkle, tulle, candles, and love are the ingredients I needed for an unforgettable wedding and that s exactly what I got. Although the details of my day kept changing there was one thing I knew for sure, I wanted to feel romanced on the beach. Five lighted chandeliers on the beach, a beautifully draped ceremony arch, and candles galore lend themselves to be the perfect backdrop for the overflowing abundance of love my husband and I felt for each other and from our guests. Dancing under a beautiful chandelier with views of the stars, the ocean breeze through may hair, and my husband s tears on my shoulder while  All of me  by John Legend played is a moment I ll never forget.'
p460
aS'We are so grateful for all the amazing vendors who played such huge roles in our special day. Now that it s all over we feel so fortunate to have been able to work with all these amazing people who have become part of our family, especially our wedding planners. Natalia + Mayte transformed my emails into my dream day. The genuine love they have for their jobs poured out of every space and every detail. Our photographers captured, every tear, every smile, and every single ounce of love displayed that day. Our pictures are a magical reminder of our perfect day and a way to relive moments I missed. Everyday I look at my pictures and get to see my daughter who was also my flower girl, walk down the aisle with eyes filled with love and excitement.\n'

A turquoise blue lake, a wooden rowboat adorned in ivory blooms, some seriously stunning style and views that will take your breath away  it s truly entrancing in every way possible. Head over to the gallery for so much more!'
p498
aS'From Sandra Aberg Photography  Silvia and Roberto were a joy to work with and made the whole day a lot of fun. Their laid back, easy going attitude and obvious passion for each other (you would never guess that these two have been together for 20 years!) was a perfect match for the elegant styling of this engagement session.'
p499
aS'We started out with a romantic boat ride and had the lake pretty much to ourselves. The simple wooden row boats were the perfect compliment to the serene mountain setting and the color of the water was intensified by the all the sunlight and clear blue sky. From there we moved to a spot on the hill, and then to the dock where the couple had prepared a picnic to enjoy.'
p500
aS'Roberto was classic Italian suave in his crisp blue jacket, white shirt and khaki pants. Silvia started in a beautiful white gown, switched to a lovely green dress, and then wore a white blouse, pants, and heels for their picnic.'
p501
aS'The elegant Silvia chose the different outfits, and had the flowers made to decorate the boat, as well as the garland she wore. It was no surprise to discover that she works as an interior designer and arcitect all over Italy.'
p502
aS'The weather, the lake, the reflections, Silvia and Roberto s love story, it all came together to create a magical experience and a fairy tale engagement session.'

aS'Guests started arriving on the island two days before the wedding from different parts of the world, including the US, UK, India, Nigeria and China. The celebrations included a welcoming dinner at a beautiful hillside villa, a sailing trip to the neighboring islands of Paxos & Antipaxos and a festive brunch at a local taverna.'
p521
aS'The wedding ceremony was held in a picturesque whitewashed Greek Orthodox chapel on a small tranquil fishing village in Corfu while the reception was hosted in a stone built breathtaking villa located north of the island s center, overlooking the blue waters of the Ionian Sea. The couple hosted a welcome cocktail on the patio of the villa where guests enjoyed local Prosecco and Hors d oeuvres while taking photos by the Greek inspired photo-booth backdrop reading OPA! in golden lettered balloons. A 5 course meal followed the cocktail reception at the villa s terrace under the romantic candlelight.'
p522
aS'The d cor there was inspired by the bride s wish to use vibrant shades of pink, often seen in the flowers used in the gardens of Greek island houses as well as the use of royal blue representing the color of the Ionian Sea, complemented by vintage Grecian gold details.'

S'My biggest weakness when it comes to wedding venues? Gorgeous old-world Spanish architecture. Case in point: The Hacienda, and the backdrop for this insanely stunning soiree from Rachel Rose Weddings. It might be the worn pale tiling, the subtle cracks in the stone or the weathered wooden doors  but it feels as if the walls have seen countless generations of love. And etched right in, is this sweet day.'
p575
aS'From Rachel Rose Weddings .Victoria and Richard were struggling to choose between our wedding venues for their big day but once they visited The Hacienda their hearts were set. They had decided on a rustic but romantic wedding and The Hacienda was the perfect setting for this with its surrounding andalucian countryside yet elegant and slightly grand main house. The wedding took place in early May and the weather was perfect for an alfresco ceremony which took place in the gardens of the house. We chose a colour palette to suit the backdrop of the venue with beautiful David Austin roses in soft peaches and creams with a few succulents to add some depth and contrast. This flower choice was then continued with the rustic styled centerpieces and buttonholes. With a classical Spanish guitarist setting the tone as the wedding guests arrived for a welcome reception of Sangria, the day was ready to start. Victoria looked beautiful in her very romantic Pronovia dress and after the ceremony the guests moved to the pool area for champagne and canap s followed by dinner and dancing long into the night in the beautifully decorated and romantically lit courtyard   a party to remember!\n'

A perfect Hawaiian soiree filled to the gills with personality and love, not to mention a stunning seaside backdrop. Every image captured by Elena Graham makes me want to squeal with glee, and you can see why here.'
p594
aS'From The Bride There was one fact about our relationship everyone knew before we got engaged  before Tom and I had considered it ourselves and that was where we would begin the rest of our lives together. My poor husband thought his job was done once he popped the question! Little did he know '
p595
aS'He is a good Kiwi bloke from New Zealand and I m an island girl from Hawaii. To complicate things further, it would be a destination wedding for more than half our guests no matter what we chose, with most of our friends residing in our current home of Sydney, Australia.'
p596
aS'Nonetheless, they confirmed it before we announced it:  We re going to Hawaii! '
p597
aS'We wanted our celebration to reflect our laid back, Pacific style, choosing the lovely Waikoloa Marriott on the Kohala coast of Hawaii s  Orchid Isle,  the Big Island. Some of my earliest memories are of hiking the peppered black and white sands along the coast with my family; my mother calling for me to wade into the cold brackish ponds lined with black stones, and my father fishing in the surf. But it wasn t easy planning a wedding across the International Date Line.'
p598
aS'My bridesmaids were all in different countries, so shopping together for a wedding dress or bridesmaids outfits was out. While I gave my girlfriends leave to mix and match their own dresses, I went with couture Australian designer Anaessia, which gave me the personalized touch of antique lace and hand-beaded blossoms that perfectly suited my island theme.'
p599
aS'My mother always said my wedding would be just like the senior prom: You get the outfit and planning down and worry about the date last. She was right she had been lining up local vendors for my wedding from the time I was a teenager, just waiting for me to pick a date!'
p600
aS'We were so lucky to have Leilani s Bakery, who made my sleepover birthday cakes, fashion a classic two-tier vanilla and haupia wedding cake with buttercream frosting. My bridesmaid and her mother (Francesca and Franca McGuffie) organized the orchid arrangements: from the bouquets and the hair accessories to the submerged cymbidium table arrangements anchored in black beach stones. We were also lucky to have Elena Graham as our photographer, a childhood friend with an eye for subtle emotion and photojournalistic storytelling.'
p601
aS'Our guests were welcomed to the ceremony with a traditional slack key guitar player and seated looking out through the palm trees and over the ocean. Tom carried the vows we wrote together in the inside pocket of his royal blue M.J. Bale suit, and it was all over too quickly. The rings, a kiss and we were man and wife.'
p602
aS'After signing the wedding licence, we greeted each of our 90 guests with a fragrant plumeria lei. It was a beautiful idea by the event manager to afford us that personal moment with each guest who made the journey to be with us.'
p603
aS'After a hearty buffet dinner organized by the hotel, my niece and nephews chased a ball across the lawn, one of the gifts my mother prepared along with a little basket of crayons and paper to entertain them through the evening.'
p604
aS'Kiwis are big on speeches, and our friends had us rolling with laughter until our cheeks were so sore we thought it was impossible to keep smiling.'
p605
aS'But I had one more surprise for my husband. Months before, I agonised over my footwear, having to choose my shoes before the dress was finished so they could tailor the length: flats or heels? Though the sand and grass were a consideration, I chose simple flat sandals so I could perform a traditional barefoot hula for my husband.'
p606
aS'It was beautiful to share this place that meant so much to my family before. Now we have another special moment here commemorating not only our union, but recognizing our friends and families as one ohana.\n'

S'This wedding is starting out with a fashionable bang (i.e. bridesmaid s dresses for the books and a lace gown that could kill) and is ending with an English Garden party ripe with crimson florals by Bo Boutique and vintage styling by Helen Millot Furnishings. We love a good garden party, after all, and this gem shot by WOOKIE Photography is proving the English know their way around a fab outdoor affair.'
p660
aS'From The Bride Ben and I went on our first date when we were 12 years old in our hometown of Cambridge, UK. We were in neighbouring schools; I was at the all girls  school and Ben was in the all boys  school down the road. Our first date was a rendez-vouz in town one Saturday lunchtime. We were young at the time so, as romantic and sweet as the date was, it didn t really go beyond sharing an ice- cream and a stroll through the park! Two years later our eyes met again at the mixed girls and boys secondary school. It was then we went on our second and more successful date and spent the most amazing 4 years together. We were high school sweethearts who got to see each other everyday and share some special moments together.'
p661
aS'We knew straight away that we wanted an English country garden wedding in Cambridge. It s where we met and where we are both from so it means a lot to both of us. The fact that it s a very beautiful city and most of our family still lived there was an added bonus.'
p662
aS'We opted for a humanist wedding. It felt like the right choice- we wanted our ceremony to be very personal and a chance to tell our story to family and friends. For us, our wedding was the chance to celebrate our next chapter with them, and also thank them for all their support over the years that had already passed.'
p663
aS'Ben and I wanted an outside ceremony in a beautiful garden and preferably near the River Cambs, so with this in mind my Mother, Ben and I began our search. After a few weeks of looking, and word getting around, a close family friend offered us their house for our wedding. The house used to belong to well know 1960s hairdresser Raymond Bessone, AKA Mr Teasy  Weasy! It s a beautiful property with lots of quirks and has the most amazing garden that leads down to a secret river. Perfect. It was typically English, typically Cambridge and in the exact right location.'
p664
aS'The style and design of our wedding definitely changed and developed over the year leading up to the day itself. A big turning point for the design of the day was when my Mother offered me her late Mother s (my Grandmother s) antique silver cutlery to use. My Grandmother, H l ne Millot, was a Parisian dressmaker and costumier in the 1920s so you can just image how old and beautiful the cutlery is. (In fact the ornate engraving on the silver suggests that some of the pieces could be over 100 years old!)'
p665
aS'And so our classic English country garden wedding became an English garden wedding with a chic French twist. I matched the antique silver cutlery with lots and lots of antique brass candlesticks, a very classic combination. The table glasses were all crystal and cut glass, and mismatched for a modern yet vintage twist. Simple white plates and white napkins gave the table clean lines avoiding the look becoming too eclectic.'
p666
aS'The colour palate was determined when I found my dress. I searched high and low for one that was off-white and I finally found it in a Justin Alexander design. The description of the dress was antique gold but in actual fact it was a gorgeous taupe colour. I matched the table linen with the colour of dress by sourcing some beautiful Ralph Lauren tablecloths, and also managed to find some perfect taupe candles which I shipped in from a shop called Blokker, in Amsterdam.'
p667
aS'The tables were adorned with beautiful deep red Peonies, grapes and Eucalyptus, all overflowing from antique brass vases onto the long tables, arranged beautifully by the talented Bo Boutique. It was a significant colour pop but worked perfectly with the lush greens coming in from the garden through the vast clear windows of the marquee.'
p668
aS'The day itself was just as I had imagined: a personal, relaxed and most importantly incredibly romantic occasion- with a party atmosphere! We had hoped for an outdoor ceremony but in typical English fashion our weather was not kind to us! But this did not in anyway dampen the mood. Our ceremony took place in the marquee, in front of the large clear windows that looked out onto the large spans of garden down to the river. Then just as the ceremony finished, as though on auto timer, the sun came out and we were able to enjoy drinks and canap s outside. It was incredible!'

It s majestic caldera views and open blue waters embracing the whitest of whites, leave you feeling surrounded by pure romance. So is true in this gorgeous seaside soiree from Anna Roussos Photography. With guests donning only white, a seriously beautiful Bride and a breathtaking backdrop, this gallery is a destination dream come true. Don t miss the film from Xavier Roussos below!'
p702
aS'From the beautiful Bride  We dreamed of a very intimate affair and decided to have our wedding some place unique. We knew that Santorini was beyond romantic and that the beauty of this island would match the love we had for one another. So with twelve of our immediate family members we began our journey as husband and wife and it was a trip of a lifetime filled with laughs, tears, and smiles.'
p703
aS'From Anna Roussos Photography  Catherine and Matt flew all the way from USA to get married in beautiful Santorini Island. They had very few guests, just immediate family, so it was very friendly and intimate affair. They also have planned a bigger celebration with all the friends and rest of the family when back home. But this lovely day in Santoirni was dedicated just to the closest ones in their lives. What can be more romantic than getting married  on top of the world ? That exactly how it feels when you are exchange your vows facing breathtaking Caldera View of Santorini.'
p704
aS'Absolutely everyone was dressed in white and it created an amazing feel, very pure and romantic. I just loved this idea and it worked very well with the colors of Santorini. Catherine was stunning in her Nicole Miller dress and Matt looked very handsome in white Calvin Klein suit. It was pleasure to be part of this great celebration and I hope you will get inspired going through the photographs of their special day.\n'

In other words, it s the definition of pure pretty.  See it all captured by Natascha Unkart in the full gallery.'
p720
aS'From the Bride  When we decided to get married , we had immediately set two priorities: the dress and the photographer. I wanted my dress to be fairly simple yet festive and found the perfect one at elfenkleid. Our second focus was the photography, which would keep the memories of our wedding day alive for years to come. A friend had recommended Natascha Unkart as a very talented and also easy-going photographer and her aesthetics matched ours completely.'
p721
aS'As for the rest, we simply wanted to throw a great party for our friends and family. We had put quite some thought into how we wanted to go about it. Our commitment to one another was supposed to be a very personal public act, so to speak. So we asked our two best friends to officiate our marriage, which was personal and fun, as well as emotional. Just the right mix! We chose a beautifully restored monastery at Sopron, Hungary as the venue for our wedding. It gave us the perfect mix of gorgeous environment (we used the garden for our ceremony), the ability to host all of our guests at the hotel, seclusion and yet proximity to our hometown of Vienna, Austria.'
p722
aS'As an illustrator and graphic designer I designed the invitation cards and all the little details myself. Friends and family helped us with the decorations, from sewing picnic blankets to filling little paper bags with wildflower seeds as wedding favors.'
p723
aS'As a theme I was inspired by midsummer. My family on my mother s side is from Sweden where this day holds a special meaning. Also, my grandparents were married on midsummer in 1946, so there was also a meaningful component to it. It s the longest day of the year and the flowers are particularly important in this tradition. In fact, you are even supposed to pick them from seven different meadows for midsummer, but we left that to the lovely people at blumengestalten who provided us with a beautiful, colorful mix. Finally, our delicious cake was made by my friend Nessa Heschmat who is just starting out with her own catering business.'

S'Having been to a destination wedding in Mexico, I can safely say they re awesomeness wrapped up in sunshine and love. And the details of this affair, think driftwood with calligraphy by KAKalligraphy and mercury glass candles, add a layer of all out romance to this tropical locale. Have a look at the full affair crafted by LVL Weddings And Events along with imagery by Brandon Kidd Photography right here.'
p803
aS'From The Bride Three adjectives that describe the day are: beautiful, romantic, and wild.'
p804
aS'We wanted it to feel like an extension of us, as if we were having a casual dinner party at our house but with amazing food and everyone dressed up. We let the natural ocean side surroundings really shine by keeping everything else quite intimate. The details we did use were pulled from our likes and backgrounds. Me, being in fashion, I love textiles and things with texture so many of the details we used were from that inspiration. I loved the chairs we draped with soft multi colored ribbon, and the arch we built that was filled with yards and yards of fabric draped over ocean driftwood.'
p805
aS'The flowers were beautifully different. We incorporated lots of textures, driftwood, branches, dusty miller, tulips and roses. I wanted so much to have anonome s but since we were married in the south of Mexico where virtually no flowers are grown there, we either had to fly them in or use the ones they offered so we decided to add in ribbon and extra fabric from my bridesmaids dresses to make them unique but at the same time really brought the whole look together.'
p806
aS'We rarely followed the typical  wedding protocol  We are traditional people but we are also very fun and we like to do things our way. So, we tried to steer away from the  traditional  wedding things. If we did the traditional things, we did them our way, like our first dance, we lead into our first dance right after our entrance, and we didn t do it to your typical love song, we danced like crazy to the song by Hall and Oats, You make my dreams. It was great, and much more a reflection of us than your typical slow dance. Same thing with other traditions like not sleeping in the same room the nights before, etc. We not only stayed in the same room, but we got up together as we normally do and had breakfast as a couple with our friends. We tried to make it a more casual, relaxed and un-planned.. more so than a day full of times, and places we had to be.'
p807
aS'We didn t have many challenges as our planning team and the hotel helped accommodate all of our wish list. If anything, it would probably be, just getting all of our friends, family and vendors down to mexico.'
p808
aS'By far, our most memorable moment of the day is the pool party! Jason and I had joked about who was going to go into the pool first and we never thought is would be us!! Once we finished with Cake cutting, we were able to sneak away to  get cleaned up  (we both had cake all over us!) so, everyone was not paying attention to us, we quickly prepared our photographer, and took off our shoes and 1-2-3! JUMPED in the pool!! At first I think our guests were shocked that someone would be so rude to Jason and Heidi by ruining the wedding and getting in the pool but once they saw it was the bride and groom (FULLY clothed in wedding attire still ) were the ones who jumped in it was a free for all. Jason and I laughed in the pool while we watched people jump in from every side of the pool! It was like they were jumping from a burning building, everyone was doing it, and they were jumping from every angle. It was so fun because our amazing musician, Kevin Miso, played a great session while we all splashed like 10 years old in the pool for a while!'
p809
aS'We did not write our own vows, but we had some input on what we wanted included in our ceremony. A theme, throughout our wedding was a quote we love by Jeremy Taylor,  Love is Friendship set on fire.  We even had a reading during the ceremony of a poem by Laura Hendricks.  Love is friendship caught fire; it is quiet, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection, and makes allowances for human weaknesses. Love is content with the present, hopes for the future, and does not brood over the past. It is the day-in and day-out chronicles of irritations, problems, compromises, small disappointments, big victories, and working toward common goals. If you have love in your life, it can make up for a great many things you lack. If you do not have it, no matter what else there is, it is not enough. '
p810
aS'I m a perfectionists and very detail oriented so my brain automatically goes to the logistics of the day .like; make sure you outline the songs, make sure you have enough welcome bags, we must have a vegetarian option for dinner, table seating arrangements, etc .but at the end of it all, my only real advice would be to surround yourself with the people who truly matter to you. The ones who you could laugh all day with no matter what s happening. Because, everything could go wrong on your day from the weather to vendors not showing up, but at the end of it all, if your jumping in the pool fully clothed (wedding gown and all) with your best friends and family, all that other stuff goes away. No one can remember what color flowers were on the table or even what song you first danced to. Those people remember the experience and who they were sharing it with. So, focus on the people you are celebrating with and the person you are committing your heart to and nothing else matters.'
p811
aS'Our favorite detail of the wedding was having our close friend marry us. We opted for a more personal feel by having someone who really knows us and our story be the one to help us commit our futures to each other. So we had the best man do double duty and he was our officiant. We didn t say vows but Karl told our story better than I think we could have.\n'

S'In the wedding blogging world, we have our own celebrities, and Lane Dittoe is definitely one of them. If you mention his name around our offices, you most likely will hear us all start listing off our favorite Lane Dittoe classics (like this one or this one or this one). Well, it s safe to say we have another beauty to add to the list, and it s all thanks to this gorgeous couple and their picture perfect Cabo San Lucas wedding. And you can see just what I mean right here. '
p907
aS'We rented a beautiful, 10,000 square foot oceanfront villa for four nights. We hired a staff to cook breakfast and lunch for us everyday and we enjoyed just a few of the many delicious restaurants Cabo had to offer. We had a wonderful time with our nearest and dearest. While the guys went golfing at Cabo del Sol, the girls stayed back at the villa where Suzanne Morel s mobile spa came to treat us to massages, manicures and pedicures overlooking the ocean. Our days were sun-drenched and spent on the beach drinking cervezas & margaritas, lounging by the pool and enjoying a full staff who attended to our guests and their every need. Our goal was that our friends didn t lift a finger and simply enjoyed themselves. I d say it was a mission accomplished.'
p908
aS'I hired a Suzanne Morel as my wedding planner and, although she helped with much of the organization, flowers and food, I DIY-ed much of my decor. I am obsessed with black & white stripes, pink and gold so it was vital that I incorporate them into the decor. Gold-rimmed plates, pink napkins, gold flatware and personalized carved wooden placeholders sat atop a single black & white striped table. The gold leafed  yours mine  signs were also custom made as well as the large golden pinata. We all sat together and enjoyed a delectable dinner, followed by dancing and more poolside lounging.'

aS'From The Bride  The day I met Pat, I instantly fell in love with him. His laid-back personality resembled mine so much. He was silly, adorable and so much fun to be around. We became close very fast and just after few months we moved in together. It didn t take much for us to realize that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together.'
p937
aS'We knew from the start that we wanted a destination wedding. We wanted a location where everyone could come together, relax, and celebrate with us. We wanted it to be personal, yet casual, simple, and easy. So the search began. After going through 40 different resort reviews and quotes we decided that Dreams Palm Beach in Dominican Republic was the resort for us. The beach was phenomenal, the grounds were immaculate and the reviews about food and service were exceptional. It was all we were looking for.'
p938
aS'After arriving at the resort our expectations were exceeded. We met with the resort s wedding planner, Julie, and she did exactly what we were hoping for. She gave us a worry free week-long vacation with our family and friends while she ensured that what we envisioned became a reality. She took care of all the details, arranged for a make up artist, a hairdresser, a florist and our entire wedding reception. Looking at the crowd of family and friends and seeing everyone having such a great time I knew we made the right decision.'
p939
aS'I loved our entire wedding and having our family and closest friends in the same place was amazing. It was better than I ever could have imagined. It was a day filled with love, happiness and excitement, tons of laughs and many tears. It was a true expression of our personalities and our love for one another. It was completely perfect.'

And with Infinite Love Wedding Coordinating working behind the scenes, this Tuscany destination affair delivers, BIG time. The fiercely talented Marisa Holmes captured each moment behind the lens, and it s all tucked away in the gallery right here.'
p997
aS'From the Bride  When Jesus and I began to plan what was to be the experience of a lifetime, we wanted our wedding to be an experience that everyone else would remember for years to come. We wanted to share in an intimate setting that would involve our closest friends and family. We wanted it to be a celebration of an all-encompassing love that was the beginning of our life together. The greatest adventure of our lives had to have the greatest stating point. We thought about our beloved California where we first met. We searched high and low from Northern wine country to Southern California s stretch of sandy beaches, yet nothing felt like the old world charm we were hoping for.'
p998
aS'As we thought about what our wedding day experience was going to be, the inspiration was simple; old world tradition meets ethereal romance. It was a true reflection of us, of our roots, and of what we wanted our future to consist of. We aspired to follow our traveling spirits, to reach further in order to find that old world charm in the rolling hillside of Italy s Tuscany region. A rustic Castello nestled in the Chianti region of Tuscany was the place where our dream wedding came to be and Castello di Spaltenna was the perfect fit. We led our friends and family on a wondrous adventure, and a wedding getaway that would covert them into world traveler s!'
p999
aS'As a designer, my vocation has been in the translation of life s beauty and art. For my own wedding, the greatest challenge was to mirror a celebration of love with the traditions of marital bliss. Our creative vision was only scattered thoughts when we first came to Infinite Love Wedding Coordinating & Consulting; Andrea Randolph completed our vision, brought it to life, and from it created a work of art. On the day of our wedding, our d cor portrayed the pureness of whites, off whites, and creams. The Castello s charming chapel was bathed in the warm glow of countless softly lit candles that filled the entire room. The ceremony began in the early evening with white petals down the aisle, and soft ribbons with white and off-white floral arrangements on the ends of each pew. We also personalized the ceremony with a musical memoir to my father, who passed away the previous year and we paid tribute to our Mexican heritage by including  las arras  (exchange of gold coins) and the  lasso  (the beaded rope) as part of the ceremony.'
p1000
aS'As the sun began to set, our wedding reception and cocktail hour was the picturesque scenery of an impressionistic painting. The colors blended to a surreal landscape and the wedding photographer of our dreams, Marisa Holmes, captured the fairytale. The cocktail hour was set on the rustic stone terrace overlooking the castle s vineyard. While the reception was the romantic image of white table linens with soft tulle covered chairs accented with an olive branch on each chair setting, symbolizing peace and prosperity.'
p1001
aS'Soft white candlelit arrangements with white flowers personified our message of purity throughout the table setting. Each seat of our large feast table was personalized with a guest card. The dinner menu itself was a work of art and we collaborated with the Castello s culinary chefs and our wedding planner to arrange a feast of rustic Italian traditional cuisine.'
p1002
aS'Our cake, our dance party with Italian DJ Pink Panther, and our Prosecco cheers with all of the Castello s staff made the night unforgettable. We even had other guests of the Castello s hotel join in the fun!'
p1003
aS'The wedding adventure consisted of so much more than just the wedding day though. It truly began with a rustic guest basket in every room that included Italian bread and wine, Italian maps, translation guidebooks, and a personalized welcoming itinerary for each guest. We also arranged several group excursions that we could share with our guests including Florence and Sienna day trips, personalized group tours, wine tasting, vineyard/cellar tours, and an exquisite culinary experience at Badia a Coltebuono, and Il Pievano restaurants.'
p1004
aS'The best reward has been the memories of our children, family, and friends that have long since retold the experience countless times from all different perspectives. They have relived the details of our wedding weekend over and over again. The countless,  thank you s  we have received from our guests expressing their gratitude for allowing them to share in our lifetime experience has been priceless.'

p1039
aS'We started with rustic wood tables and metal chairs to enhance the semi-minimalistic approach to Mexico as a whole and the gorgeous hotel more specifically. This was a perfect canvas to layer on the color and detail to contrast the neutral desert landscape surrounding the villa. An ethnic print table runner was the foundation for the the wooden boats featuring vibrant textural blooms, patterned koozies bursting with succulents and a rainbow of colored votives sprinkled throughout the tablescape. The look was tied together with modern, white, square chargers topped with vibrant Folk Project napkins made from traditional Mexican fabrics.'
p1040
aS'As for the attire, we imagined what a modern, easy-going, yet wildly sophisticated couple would wear to celebrate their wedding. The bride donned a stunning floral crown and unexpected suede boots under her gorgeous gown for a touch of rustic elegance, while the groom chose a fitted slate grey suit.\n'

S'If there s one lesson we can take away from this wedding, it s that marrying in the French Riviera is ALWAYS a good idea. From the quiet ceremony nestled in an olive grove to the al fresco reception where good food and wine flowed a plenty, it s basically every bride s dream brought to life, and Katy Lunsford captured every moment to utter perfection. Happy swooning, lovelies!'
p1091
aS'From the Bride  We met on a little island in the Caribbean whilst both working on different private yachts. He was the dashing Swedish captain and I was the wild and precocious American stewardess and it was love at first date. My original inspiration for the wedding was 1960 s America meets 1920 s France. I wanted to re-create that luxurious lust for entertainment and aesthetic from the twenties and marry it with the grounded natural beauty and community experience that I like to think of the sixties embodying.'
p1092
aS'After choosing a date, we had to pick a country. I am American, Oskar is Swedish, we met in the Caribbean, and we had chosen to buy our first home in the South of France where many of our friends live. In the end, we picked France, mostly due to it being where the least amount of people were required to fly in long distance. Having the venue sorted so late meant scrambling to plan everything else, and doing this in a new language in a country didn t make it easier. Plus, I decided early on that I wanted everything unique, everything DIY, no professional help other than catering, AND I wanted it to be very calm and relaxed on the days leading up to the big event. (Anyone reading this who has been married, feel free to laugh loudly and knowingly.)'
p1093
aS'Needless to say, it was a wild and crazy ride the last week before the wedding. With the help of our amazing officiant we finalized the ceremony two days before, we wrote our vows late at night the night before (but we slept apart!), the venue was still being pieced together until just before the ceremony, the DJ canceled on our way to the wedding, it threatened rain (I had NO rain provision whatsoever as I thought it would ruin the vintage vibe), there wasn t nearly enough time for photos, half the much laboured over projects never made it out of crates, so many things were missed, so many things were lost and yet it was the most wonderful, perfect, fabulous, unique, love-filled love fest I could have ever imagined and I wouldn t change a thing. I married the most incredible man in the world that day and every time I think about it I still get butterflies. '
p1094
aS'The venue was so full of natural beauty and color that I knew we could keep flowers fairly minimal. I wanted mostly neutrals, whites, and olive green, but no pink. One incredible bridesmaid is a florist extraordinaire and she so kindly did every arrangement and bouquet for the event and they turned out so beautiful! The table was kept fairly simple, with glass chargers, white plates, white napkins, white table cloths and a natural sand colour linen runner which ran the length of all 115 settings! The floral arrangements were set far apart in order to accommodate food, and my love of all things gold was accomplished with a bag of rough chopped gold foil confetti. I also took ordinary white and wooden candle holders and using spray paint and gold glitter, made them a little more interesting. The day of I never actually had time to put it all together as planned but my bridal party took the lead and did an incredible job making my vision come to life, with no direction from me.'
p1095
aS'Advice: Keep it simple or get help. I was so set on doing everything myself that it ended up making so much more work for the people around me. Had a hired a weekend of coordinator and made even just a few really comprehensive and easy to follow lists, I could have eased the burden on my friends and family and had even more of the vision executed. Also, not every single that has to be complicated. I love all those complicated tiny little details that nobody else probably notices, but if you are more concerned with enjoying the days before hand and the day of, trust me that in the end they aren t as essential as you think. And in the end, nothing other than looking into your husbands eyes and saying the biggest, most important, most exciting  YES  of your life will matter. Our day was so fun, so beautiful, so happy, so eventful, and my favourite part is still those moments of holding hands and saying our vows. '

aS'From The Bride Hywel and I met two weeks after I arrived in London, five years ago. I d just moved over from New York (ostensibly for a year !) and happened to move into a flat with one of his best friends from university. One day I walked into the living room, saw this gorgeous Brit sitting there, and that was basically it. I was a goner. It took us a couple of months to make it official, but ever since then we ve been happily living out our little London love story. I work as an account director for a branding & design agency, while Hywel oversees brand partnerships for the men s health charity, Movember. We got engaged on a Saturday morning, lying in bed:'
p1196
aS'Me:  What shall we do today? '
p1197
aS' Hywel:  Shall we get engaged? '
p1198
aS'I ve never been interested in a big, traditional proposal, so for us it was just right. After crying, laughing, family phone calls and a couple of Bloody Mary s, we went into town to buy me a wedding ring! That night, we had friends over for a big Italian feast, shared our good news, and basked in the excitement. We got engaged in November, and knew right away we wanted to try to fit in a wedding within the next seven or eight months. Then the panic set in! Thankfully, we found One Marylebone fairly quickly, and once that was booked, everything else fell into place. We were able to give my American friends & family six months  notice in order to book flights across the pond.'
p1199
aS'Our wedding planning was definitely a partnership   I was very lucky that my groom has event planning skills and industry contacts in spades! We share a similar aesthetic and are both pretty decisive, so we were able to keep the process moving along pretty quickly. The day itself was just absolutely amazing. It felt like  us , which is exactly what we wanted. I walked down the aisle to The Beatles   Here Comes the Sun  on the piano   just hearing the opening bars to the music now make me start to tear up! My grandfather, who is a federal judge in New York, delivered a sort of secular sermon with an incredible presence that moved everyone. Our friend Libby, who introduced us, read  I carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart)  by E.E. Cummings. Hywel and I also wrote our own vows, which is much less of a thing here in the UK. It was wonderful to commit to each other in a way that was personal to us. I wouldn t have done it any other way. Another friend, Miranda Heldt, a professional singer, performed the soulful  All over again  by Sharon Jones during the register signing. And then finally, we walked back down the aisle to  Signed, Sealed, Delivered  by Stevie Wonder, which was such a fun, unexpected thing for our guests to hear after a heartfelt ceremony. It definitely changed the tone   it was time to party! I worked with the lovely Charlotte at Hayford & Rhodes on our flowers. For our ceremony, we chose beautiful silver birch trees for the front of the room. They added drama and a simple, natural feel to the space.'
p1200
aS'Seasoned Events worked with us to create our menu. Hywel and I love to host dinner parties, and we wanted our wedding to feel like the best one yet. We chose to have antipasti sharing platters to start, which really got people chatting and interacting with each other and the food. We served a delicious chicken breast with summer pea risotto cake and pea puree for the main, followed by truly decadent chocolate fondant. We worked with family friend and wine merchant, Simon Taylor, to choose a subtle Champagne, bright Sauvignon Blanc and yummy Pinot Noir to serve throughout the day. Our beer choice was just as personal: Camden Town Brewery is situated just down the road from our flat, and I m a Boston girl by birth, so it only made sense to have Sam Adams for both our Yankee & British guests. We placed little cork-topped bottles of Welsh whisky at every guest s place as name cards. Hywel s entire family hails from the same area as that particular whisky distillery, and our relationship was definitely cemented over a shared love of neat whisky.'
p1201
aS'We hired huge light letters (H&L) to transform the space for the evening dancing. It really added fun to a space that is usually so elegant and refined. Plus they look awesome in pictures! Our phenomenal DJ had the dance floor packed from start to finish, and the whole thing just had such a fun & joyful feel to it. Some of our wonderful friends got us a guestbook & Polaroid camera to help us capture moments throughout the day. There are some pretty epic shots and very sweet notes in there.'
p1202
aS'My advice to every bride is simply to soak it all in. Everyone says it s important to take a moment, just the two of you, to step away and just look at what s happening all around you. Hywel and I were able to do that a few times throughout the night, and it was pretty incredible. I also made myself stay very present during the ceremony. It sounds like an obviously or silly thing, but someone once gave me that advice and I found it invaluable. Also, I found wedding morning yoga a really special and calming way to start the day! Oh, and pay as much as you can for a great photographer. It is the best investment you can make! After all, what are you left with after the fact, other than your photos?!'

Paired with a stunning Bride donning an Inbal Dror dress, I can t help but be mesmerized by every single shot. See them all in the gallery.'
p1242
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Paris   It was certainly a dream come true. Shortly after we got engaged and about a year leading up to our special day, I had countless variations of where and how our wedding would turn out to be. The common theme amongst my many visions was that this wedding, wherever it ended up being, was inevitably destined to be intimate and elegant.'
p1243
aS'By channeling our passion for fashion, the arts and beautiful architecture, Paris was simply the perfect choice. We couldn t think of a more appropriate opportunity to celebrate our unity by planning a hopelessly romantic wedding and an once-in-a-lifetime trip for all of our friends, family and most importantly, for each other.'
p1244
aS'Now that once the destination was decided, we had a couple of options: a chateau wedding? A wedding in a hotel? We wanted to make traveling for guests as easy as possible without having to rent a car or traveling more, so we decided on a hotel. My vision was romantic yet elegant. After contemplating on many inspiration boards and color themes, I decided on blush, cr me and champagne as I thought it would best fit the Four Seasons George V for our wedding. I wanted to incorporate similar colors to the rich, romantic feel of Parisian arts and d cor and thought those colors would best compliment because they were subtle yet sophisticated.'
p1245
aS'Planning a wedding from abroad in a country that I was unfamiliar with; with the language barrier, different time zones and working fulltime (right, ladies?) made this an experience of a lifetime. Every moment, beginning from the day we started planning up until the very last minute of the wedding night was truly a memorable one.'
p1246
aS'After the ceremony, as we were taking pictures, we were greeted by waving, applauding pedestrians. The genuine smiles from the strangers helped us express the love we had on this fantasy day in Paris. The wedding day was more beautiful than anything I could have ever dreamt of   from the gorgeous weather to the view of the Eiffel Tower from our hotel suite, the intimate group of our family and friends were the perfect people to share the momentous day with. On a warm, spring night, the romantic sophistication of Paris swept through the air and our wonderful photographers   Ethan and Karis, did an amazing job capturing this special day that will allow us to reminiscence in true color for the rest of our lives.'
p1247
aS'Believe it or not, After only a couple weeks of dating, Jun bought me a Jimmy Choo Passport Cover for Valentine s Day and wrote,  So we can travel in style together.  Little did we know that would come true. In fact, the passport cover was the same material and exact design line as my reception shoes, unintentionally! That there told me it was meant to be. The first gift I had ever received from Jun became an essential to our wedding and we sure did  travel in style.  Escaping to Paris was the perfect solution to being truly relaxed and having fun, while still having a stylish wedding.'
p1248
aS'We wanted to incorporate the elegance of the Four Seasons and the delicacy of the French language to the d cor as much as possible. Since our intimate wedding required four guest tables, it was the perfect idea to name the guest tables after each season in French. This enabled us to thematically decorate each of the four guest tables  flowers by the color and tone of each season. So fitting yet, so unique as we found the words  printemps,  t , automne, and hiver  absolutely beautiful and motivational to use for our d cor.'
p1249
aS'Our escort cards   I wanted these to be particularly unique since there are so many variations of escort cards. I wanted them to be special and something that would set the theme for the wedding and would stand out. I thought, why not feathers since I incorporated them into our wedding invitations?'
p1250
aS'The only thing that was DIY was those feathers, feathers, feathers. I went to numerous craft stores in the city to look for the PERFECT feathers. Now many know, feathers do not come in perfect condition; flimsy at best. I finally made it to a craft store that most students from Parsons and FIT go to to get their fabric and found just the right amount of white feathers and bought their whole stock. Most, if not all, were in horrible condition which I knew would be a huge project.'
p1251
aS'First, I had to cut out  sample  escort name cards to see how it d fit and how much I had to cut from the stem. After testing and wasting many, I trimmed the sides of every feather and made it primp and proper. Second, I used a flat iron and curling iron to fix the ends and hair sprayed each one so they would stay in tact. I was worried how  in tact  they would be during the travel and making it to Paris. That was something I d worry about later. Third, had to go back and trim each one to make each look as similar as possible   from the length to the dimensions of the feathers as they would be standing up. Fourth, I Inserted them into thick books to flatten and straighten the strands out more. Waited a few more hours and Voila! Perfection. Fifth, I gave my MOH dimensions of the escort cards that I would want cut out so she could type in each guest s name. We picked the perfect font to match the feathers and my theme, and I printed them on card stock and cut them to stick onto the stems of the feathers. We found a styrofoam box at our florist s and spray painted it glitter gold and made it a base for the feathers to stand on. The amount of feather hair and dust we ate from these, I cannot tell you. We looked like a sweatshop spread out with different sections of each feather. All in all, it took 5hrs to finish and I could not tell you how proud I was in making my perfect, yet unique escort cards that guests would remember. If I had to do it all over again, I would.'

aS'From Rebecca Arthurs Photography  The Haiku Mill is one of those places that when you leave, it feels like you woke up from a dream. We were blessed to shoot a bridal session there with styling by Pacific Weddings magazine. Tucked away in the hills of Maui, this beautiful old sugar mill is so peaceful and full of life. We wanted to capture the bride s simple and natural beauty with nothing to distract from the setting. It was glorious to capture raw images without all the details and glitter that can sometimes overshadow the truth about beauty. The scenic images compliment our vision of raw beauty along Maui s coast.\n'

aS'From Weddings By Nicola and Glen We recently photographed a wedding inspiration shoot at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons, one of the most famous luxury hotels in Britain renown for its 2 Michelin star food and idyllic countryside setting. The overall concept was Fusion   Where East Meets West and was designed, styled and co-ordinated by Vicki & Michelle of event design house Pocketful of Dreams. '
p1318
aS'From Michelle of Pocketful of Dreams  Inspired by the stunning Japanese Tea Gardens at the venue, we worked from a back story of a stylish British couple who had been heavily influenced by their travels to the Orient and set out to create a look that had an elegant feel with stylish and thoughtful touches across all the d cor and details, subtly and creatively portraying that Far East influence. We worked with a rich, warm colour palette of burgundy, wine, soft pinks and peach with a grounding base of oyster silk, all offset by plenty of leafy greens. Brass and antique gold tones were then added to establish a luxe/old world feel that emulated a refined luxury.\n'

S'The only thing that could possibly top a rehearsal dinner in the middle of the South African wild, is a wedding following suit. This gem is overflowing with the raw beauty of an African safari coupled with impeccably crafted details at the hands of Afresh Event Design, Nineteen Eight Five, and Wedding Concepts. Now throw in image after stunning image by Mike Falco For Christian Oth Studio and you have a gallery not to be missed.'
p1386
aS'From The Bride While Jon and I got ready with our family and wedding parties, the guests were treated to an early morning game drive at sunrise. After our preparations, we boarded the safari jeeps once again for the ceremony at Inkwazi Hide, a large, wooden deck under a 200-year-old Acacia tree overlooking the Sabie River. A local African choir sang Zulu praise songs as I walked down the aisle and we were greeted by our officiant who spoke on themes of friendship, adventure and nature (punctuated by hilarious hippo grunts coming from the river). When we were pronounced man and wife, our guests surprised us by loudly trumpeting on Vuvuzelas. Afterwards, Jon and I snuck away for a few photos and our guests were treated to signature cocktails while taking in a glorious African sunset on a deck overlooking the river. When it was time, guests journeyed towards the candlelit reception dinner.'
p1387
aS'Memorable Moments True to our adventure theme, some of our most memorable moments from the wedding were the unplanned and unexpected ones. Our 2-year-old ring bearer not only dressed up as a lion cub, but also burst out with spontaneous roars as he walked down the aisle. A curious hippo joined us during our couples shoot on the riverbed. And despite the demanding travel and early morning safaris, guests rallied and still managed to dance the night away. One of my favourite moments was during the last song of the night, Toto s  Africa.  As the lyrics blared  I bless the rains down in Africa  at 3am, it started to pour and we all rushed outside to dance in the rain.'
p1388
aS'Local flavor Since the locale was so rich in raw beauty and splendor, we wanted the African landscape to be the focus and also tried to stay true to local elements and flavors. Waiting for guests in their lodges on arrival was a handmade Guide Box, filled with South African favourites like rooibos tea and Amarula liqueur. Also included were some clues for an adventure-filled weekend: a compass, an Acacia twig, and a Field Guide with information on local customs, wildlife facts and useful Shangaan phrases. To ensure that the florals would hold up under the fierce African sun, we opted for a combination of King Proteas, succulents and feinbos. As guests enjoyed local wines from the famous Stellenbosch region, a group of traditional Zulu dancers set the African rhythms in motion by teaching guests tribal dances.'
p1389
aS'Personal details We wanted the wedding to be not just a celebration with family and friends but also a heartfelt thank you and show of appreciation for their constant love and support throughout the years. We tried to achieve this through personalized details. These ranged from surprising guests with their childhood photos on their seating cards (a great conversation starter) to calligraphy on the place cards with goofy nicknames and individual welcome  telegrams  that described our favorite past adventures with the guest.'
p1390
aS'In gratitude In the end, it was a true  Wild At Heart  wedding adventure. A bottomless THANK YOU to Kim and Michael for helping to create and document our dream wedding. Jon and I were so grateful to begin our new chapter together with such an incredible adventure with our family and friends.\n'

S'There s something about this Egyptian wedding that feels completely exotic and wildly romantic all at once. With cool, blue colors and architecture that left our mouths dropped, La Maison Bleue was the ultimate setting for the two-day festivities and Christian Oth Studio captured every last bit. It s a wedding that ll inspired you in more ways than one, and don t miss the full gallery for part one of this cultural lovefest.'
p1441
aS'From the Bride  When Mo and I got engaged, we knew two things: we wanted to throw a destination wedding, and we wanted Christian Oth Studio to document it. We are both Egyptian/Canadians living in Dubai, and with friends and family flying in from different corners of the world, we wanted it make sure our wedding was a getaway experience for everyone.'
p1442
aS'After setting the date, the first vendor we booked was the photographer. We knew that while every detail mattered, all that would remain would be beautiful photographs and our memories of the day. We contacted Christian Oth Studio and I remember praying that either one of the two incredibly talented Christian Oth or Shawn Connell would be available. When we received the email from the studio that said they were both available, and would both be shooting our wedding we couldn t believe it. We were over the moon.'
p1443
aS'We found our venue by pure chance. Mo was visiting friends in the Red Sea resort town El Gouna when he spotted an intriguing blue house; he later discovered it was a boutique hotel called La Maison Bleue. The 10-room property, with its antique furniture, dramatic marble staircase, and Colonial fa ade, epitomized the kind of old-world grandeur that appealed to us as a couple. It felt like a Levantine fantasy, with bits of Ancient Egypt, Venice, and Istanbul weaved into its architecture and interior design. And with intricate details filling every corner of every room, we fell in love with it pretty much instantly. That, coupled with its beachside location and intimate feel, sealed the deal for us. We couldn t believe that this hidden gem was only an hour s flight away from Cairo!'
p1444
aS'The striking hotel made for a dreamlike backdrop to our event, which we filled with timeless, whimsical details to match. Overgrown flowers and cascading blooms covered the venue. A five-piece band filled the air with jazz tunes. A banquet of hearty gourmet dishes was laid out in the venue s dining room. Still, we made sure to also include plenty of personal touches from the napkins printed with our favorite Rumi poems, to the confetti bar filled with petals from my favorite flowers, and even the mini monogrammed cakes we gave away as favors, mimicking the wax seal on our invitations. And with our amazing planners, Cherry on Top Events, by our side everything went by seamlessly.'
p1445
aS'The most memorable part of our wedding was our first dance, which took place right after our big, traditional zaffe entrance. I remember the loud Arabic percussions dying down and our friends and families surrounding us in the courtyard. The moment Sleeping at Last s  Tethered  started playing, it felt like we were the only two people in the world. Then, a soft wind started blowing and picked up my veil in its way, which kept wrapping around Mo and I as we danced. It felt truly magical.'
p1446
aS'The best advice I can give engaged brides is to truly savor every moment of your engagement period and enjoy the planning process. With so many decisions to make it s easy to get overwhelmed. But it s important to remember that your wedding should be a celebration of who you are as a couple and as individuals. And to me, there was nothing more fulfilling than injecting all the little bits of ourselves into our wedding, and sharing it all with the people we love.\n'

Nothing better than best friends who find their way into love. Both Emelie and Alex come from famiies in Canada with restaurant backgrounds. They chose a destination wedding in Maui but wanted a beautiful dinner party. The table as well as the delicious food was centerpiece of their wedding. And relaxing under the stars, enjoying their meal and cocktails surrounded by their family and best of friends, was the perfect wedding plan for them in Hawaii.\n'

Especially since I have been spending my morning gazing at this bundle of gorgeous inspiration from Vanessa & Caroline   Cr atrices de Mariages and Rebecca Yale Portraits. Because this, my friends, is a Paris  I do  at its absolute finest.  See soooo much more right here.'
p1533
aS'From Vanessa & Caroline   Cr atrices de Mariages  Rebecca and I came together to create a beautiful inspiration editorial for a chic Parisian elopement. Even though we live and work in Paris we don t have a lot of opportunities to do a typical Parisian shoot. Paris is an endless source of inspiration. The city is so magical and romantic, we are never tired of seeing the Eiffel Tower or the streets of Montmartre. Everything in Paris from the caf s to the streets and buildings has a romantic touch everywhere you look. We wanted to style this elopement as a romantic escape in Paris: rose poudr , French roses, croquembouche from the famous Angelina, the streets of Montmarte   all the ingredients to a perfect and glamorous elopement in Paris. With this in mind, it made perfect sense start our day at the Eiffel Tower which is a stunning backdrop and takes our breath away every time. There is nothing quite as iconic as La Tour Eiffel and is the perfect spot to say intimate  I do s. '
p1534
aS'The second Parisian place we absolutely wanted to take pictures at was Angelina s. Perfectly located on the Rue de Rivoli with its grand arches, this famous French pastry boutique and tea room is an institution in Paris, the symbol of the Parisian  art de vivre  for more than a century. It was Coco Chanel s favorite place for her morning cappuccino. She used to come to Angelina every day while she was living at Le Meurice next door and sit at the same table. Angelina is launching a new collection of French wedding cakes and the chef created a masterpiece for us   the gorgeous and classic croquembouche. Next we took a stroll in Montmartre strolling down the cobblestone streets, perfect for lovers who want to take a quiet moment and discover Paris. Micha l Leal created a classic French bridal bouquet with French roses (Pierre de Ronsard), whites and blush pinks for a romantic touch. He also staged the croquembouche from Angelina s, showing how classic Parisian flowers can add another layer of elegance to a dessert table. The delicacy and softness of the flowers added a classical yet lovely touch to the cake. The gorgeous bride with her elaborate and romantic updo wore a lovely couture wedding dress by Parisian designer Christophe-Alexandre Docquin paired with stunning Chanel earrings as another nod to classic Parisian elegance and grace. In true Parisian style we combined a classic Parisian designer with a fabulous new one for a romantic and grand wedding getaway in Paris.'

S'There s nothing quite like the romance-filled air at a chateau wedding in Provence. And when you ve got Lavender & Rose behind all the pretty planning? It s bound to be flawless. From Laetita C s sweet blooms to the pop-of-pink macaron box favors and all the gorgeous portraits from Caught The Light, you can get your swoon on right here.'
p1602
aS'From the beautiful Bride  How did you meet? We got introduced by a friend at a birthday party in Miami.'
p1603
aS'Why did you choose to marry in France? Omer proposed to me on a beautiful swing in front of a lake near lavender fields in Provence. We fell in love with the area and immediately decided to get married there. We did a lot of research on the internet, as we don t live in France. Right after seeing some pictures of Chateau du Martinet online, it became my first choice. We spoke to our wedding planners and they highly recommended the chateau, we then immediately scheduled a visit to make the final decision. When we saw it, we knew it was the place.'
p1604
aS'As soon as I entered the venue the first time, I was breath-taken: it was better than what I had always dreamed of. The chateau was decorated very elegantly and effortlessly French-chic inside and out. We knew we would have good wine, and amazing food with exceptionally good value!'
p1605
aS'The ceremony area was so magical; a long aisle lined with huge cypress trees on each side. Walking down the aisle was my most memorable moment, seeing the excitement on the faces of our family and friends. We had to hold the legal ceremony in our country of birth, so we had a humorous symbolic ceremony in France where the celebrant was groom s brother in law. We wanted it to be romantic, elegant. We also wanted it to be very natural, so our guests to feel very warm, welcomed and loved. We chose a colour palette of light pink, green, cantaloupe, white. We wanted a soft, natural cosy look. In order to create a romantic feel with our flowers, we used light colored roses and hydrangeas. I love peonies, but it wasn t the right season for them, so my lovely florist recommended David Austin roses that looked very similar to peonies. I wanted the nature and the big trees of the courtyard to be reflected at the tables, that s why we used dark green leaves and boxwood trees. My bouquet was made up of lily of the valley, David Austin roses and white bouvardia.'
p1606
aS'Our timing was perfect for the ceremony and evening and the sun set exactly after the grand entrance. We were also very happy that the layout of the tables we drew and planned worked out perfectly and exactly as we had envisioned. Our florist and caterers were brilliant and recommended to us by our wedding planners, Lavender & Rose.'
p1607
aS'We love bicycle riding as a couple. Our save the dates had 2 bicycles printed and Jennifer, one of our wedding planners, had the idea of getting a vintage bike just for photos, she found one in an antique market in France. I sourced our escort fans from a calligrapher in Istanbul and had them printed at a local printing house in Istanbul. Guests used them to cool down and to find their seat too.'
p1608
aS'We selected each and every detail on the table, starting from chairs, tablecloth, glasses, cutlery, plates and our florist supplied all the candles and vases based on our taste. I created the design of the Menus, and had it printed in a local printing store, which was a bargain. We dined on lobster tail with honey lavender sauce, asparagus risotto with truffles, Herb crusted lamb chops, followed by a fantastic French Dessert Buffet. For wedding favours, we had macaroon boxes, which had to be shipped from United States to Turkey.'
p1609
aS'We had an extravagant photo-booth backdrop completely from fresh pink roses and props for our guests to hold. The photo-booth printed 2 photos of the same picture, 1 to be kept and the other to be put in our wedding notebook, where guests signed and wrote their wishes to us. It was a huge success, definitely recommended and provided by Alban Pichon. We had asked for the hallway to be filled with black and white round balloons, and our guests loved them and carried them to the reception area and of course to the dance floor.'
p1610
aS'If you are having a wedding abroad, make sure to organize a dinner or an activity, on each day of the weekend for your guests. Give them a welcome hand-book with details, and timeline of the weekend. The best thing about our weekend was traveling together with family and friends, enjoying and celebrating our marriage the whole weekend.'

S'Do me a favor: before you do anything else re: this beautiful wedding, read the description below. Seriously  before you dive into the gorgeous images from Athena Kalindi, before you fall in love with the stunning gown from Nicole Miller and before your jaw drops over the breathtaking backdrop that is Yosemite, read the story of how two people wouldn t let anything (and I mean anything) stop them from tying the knot in one of the world s most gorgeous locales.  It s truly, truly inspiring.  See it all here.'
p1627
aS'From Athena Kalindi Photography  This New York City couple planned a destination wedding in Yosemite with only 12 people in attendance. The government shut down, but the couple still came to California (they were supposed to get married at the Ahwahnee Hotel) and the hotel offered for them to move the wedding to the Tenaya Lodge outside of the park. With hope the park may open, the couple stayed at the Tenaya and waited until October 13th  with no movement from the government, the park was still closed. The couple decided to get dressed and attempt a park wedding anyhow! We said we were moving through to cross the park, but once inside the rangers sort of looked the other way while we spent hours alone in the vast and immense beauty of Yosemite (including being the only people at The Ahwahnee!)! After a few hours of portraits, we met the rest of the wedding party along the side of the road and conducted the ceremony. It was absolutely flawless   and the couple ended up with the wedding of their dreams.'
p1628
aS'Another super cool element to this story? Their pre   wedding story was told by many major publications including the BBC and Buzzfeed. They were grouped with some other couples who told stories about how the Government closure had affected their wedding plans. '

Melissa Fuller snapped up every tropical-loving moment and you can see them all in the gallery!'
p1668
aS'From the beautiful Bride  This dress caught my eye because of the classic yet elegant design. I was looking for a fitted, sheath dress with a chapel train and because of the humid weather in Tulum, I needed a lightweight fabric. This dress had two layers, the bottom was made of silk and the out layer was made of embroidered lace with detailed beading throughout. My favorite was the low-v back and the button detailing down the center.'
p1669
aS'La Zebra Hotel couldn t have been more perfect for our style. The hotel had a total of 15 brightly colored rooms, which ensured that it would only be our guests at the hotel during the wedding. It was so easy to develop a relationship with the staff and by the end of our seven day stay they felt like close friends. We invited them to share a celebratory tequila shot with us the night of our wedding. We stayed in the ocean front Bridal Suite for the majority of our stay at La Zebra. This room was gorgeous! It had a panoramic view of the beach and we would often see our guests enjoying tropical cocktails and swimming in the clear blue waters. We can t wait to go back for an anniversary trip!'
p1670
aS'The engagement ring had belonged to my husbands grandmother in the 1940 s. It was a simple design with a marquis diamond in the center and was flanked by smaller diamonds. Originally, the band was silver. We wanted to keep the integrity of the design but update the material, so we had the band replaced with rose gold. Since the design of my engagement ring was very unique we decided on a less traditional wedding band that could be worn alone but still compliment the art-deco design. The bride band is made of rose gold with a pave setting and designed by Bony Levy.'
p1671
aS'We used classic white flowers that we purchased from the local florist in Tulum and we collected foliage from the site to give it a tropical and rustic feel. I was lucky enough to have a sister who is also a floral designer, so she was able to make the bridal party bouquets, boutonnieres and simple centerpieces the day of the wedding.'
p1672
aS'Cups Co Cups was a surprise favor to our guests, we provided sustainable stainless steel cups with custom drawn images of the two of us on them. Our guests were able to reuse these cups for many margaritas during their stay in Tulum!'

aS'In lue of a dessert table, we hired a motorized ice cream cart to surprise our guests with homemade chocolate, coconut and mango flavored ice cream cones. He pulled his brightly colored cart alongside the dance floor to serve our guests.'

p1675
aS'Our wedding photographer Melissa Fuller created hand painted maps of Tulum and a list of events to pass out to our guests at the Welcome Reception. We fastened small envelopes with ibuprofen that read  Hangover Cure  to each packet.'
p1676
aS'As a late night snack the restaurant had prepared vegetable and cheese empanadas to serve as the partying died down. They were much needed after a night of dancing and drinking.'
p1677
aS'Once the DJ played the final song of the evening, the party wasn t over yet. About half of the guests ended up swimming in the ocean. It was definitely a highlight of the evening, especially looking back at the venue from the water and seeing all of the lights strung around the open-air dance floor. It was amazing!\n'

S'Tucked away in the Israeli countryside is a wedding where the beauty of nature takes center stage. Yael and Uri focused on crafting a day of inspired simplicity and Liron Erel made sure no moment went uncaptured. Ready for more? Watch the story unfold in the full gallery right here.'
p1720
aS'From The Bride  When Uri, my husband, planned our first date, he planned a tour based on Tel Aviv s most beautiful and unique trees. His personal favorite was the Indian Banyan Tree, as there are only nine of them in the whole of Israel. When we started planning for our wedding it felt natural to search for a venue that reflects our love for each other, nature and, of course, the Indian Banyan Tree. We found all these in HaAchuza, a greenhouse based in the middle of wheat fields, which also serves as a home to an Indian Banyan Tree. The moment we stepped through the gates, HaAchuza immediately felt like home, and the nature there, echoed a spiritual quality of simplicity.'
p1721
aS'In turn, we kept the details as natural and homey as possible. We spent the day together walking around the trees and fields, then proceeded to invite our guests for a delicious dinner with Irish music softly playing, the smell of freshly made pasta and grand plates of Paella and only at nightfall, under the grape vines, surrounded by family and friends and beneath my late grandfather s  Tallit , a traditional Jewish garment, we got married, and it was truly breathtaking.'
p1722
aS'For our invitations, Uri hand drew 300 of our guests so that each one could recognize themselves and their families on the invitation itself!. It made our guests feel truly welcomed and that much more involved in our wedding, which was important to us, because we really felt as though it wasn t just our day, it was a day to remember for all the people in our lives as well.\n'

p1772
aS'From FunkyBird Photography On a lovely April spring day we had the privilege to do this inspired bridal shoot. We had been walking around with the idea for a while so we were very exited when we finally made all the arrangements and got everybody on board for this collaboration.'
p1773
aS'The location is one of Tuscany s pearls. Villa di Maiano is situated just below Fiesole on the outskirts of Florence, Italy and from there you have breathtaking views on the surrounding hills. The staff was just wonderful and we were so lucky to have Alexandra around helping us.'

p1836
aS'We didn t have a color scheme or a theme as such. Everything was just  stuff we like . I love anything that s had a past life and love to know where something has come from and the story behind it. We spent endless weekends collecting and gathering bits.

aS'Justin s suit was from Ted Baker, his Grandmother passed away a month before the wedding and left, with his mum, a lucky Horseshoe brooch to be given to him on the morning of our big day. It looked perfect.'

aS'Our best idea was deciding to have a cinematographer. We had Will from Cin  Reportage and it was the best money that we ever spent. They went above and beyond on the day and fit in perfectly. It was so unobtrusive that people were surprised when we said we had a film made. We can t talk highly enough about them, the film makes me cry every time, it is so romantic.'
p1842
aS'Justin in case you re wondering about the chimney sweeps(!): In Great Britain it is considered lucky for a bride to see a chimney sweep on her wedding day. It started about 200 years ago when a London chimney sweeper saved the life of King George III. The sweep had been the only person brave enough to stop the King s out of control horses and carriage. By Royal Decree the King proclaimed that all sweeps are good luck bearers and should be treated with respect. The folklore was established and to this day chimney sweeps are still invited to attend weddings and kiss the bride for good luck.'

aS'From The Bride Both of us were born in Sri Lanka and as teenagers moved to New Zealand, so we wanted to try and incorporate the best of both worlds, in to various aspects of the wedding as well as making the day light and fun for everyone. We decided to have the wedding in Sri Lanka because we wanted our extended families to be a part of our big day.'
p1894
aS'We still wanted to keep the traditional elements in tact but added modern aspects to things like decorations and the overall flow of the wedding. We did a lot of research on the internet as well as looking through magazines. But the first thing we decided on was a color scheme which was yellow and grey.'
p1895
aS'We really wanted to make use of the beautiful weather in Sri Lanka by having the Poruwa ceremony (traditional Sri Lankan wedding ceremony) outside. Cinnamon Lakeside hotel, with the Beirra Lake as a back drop provided the perfect outdoor space in the middle of Colombo. We requested the decorators to provide a classic elegant theme and specified the Poruwa (altar) to be made with a white washed antique door (symbolising our entry in to a new chapter in life) to complement the outdoor space. The Poruwa ceremony was followed by a cocktail function to allow our guests to relax, mingle and enjoy the weather outside with a variety of cocktails and nibbles. With the help of our wedding planner, we set up a photo booth, a sweet station, sparklers and music to create a fun atmosphere.'
p1896
aS'For the wedding reception; while we wanted it to be elegant, we didn t want to over crowd the ballroom area too much. The wedding decorators were great at making an outdoor inspired theme/colour scheme fit in to an indoor space. We provided them with various photos that we had collected up over the months. Both of us love food and music and so we used this as inspiration for our wedding favours. Apart from the traditional wedding cake that is given to the guests, we packaged up our favourite chocolate (Whittakers) from New Zealand in clear plastic boxes (which were all packed and wrapped by my family) and also a small jar of Lemon Curd (to represent our time in the United Kingdom) with our favourite recipe attached to it. All the boxes, labels and other packing material we purchased from the UK before we came to Sri Lanka. In addition we also made a wedding play list with seven of our favourite songs (both Sri Lankan and English), which we arranged in a rattan basket so that guests could help themselves to them, if they so desired.'

From the jeweled Jenny Packham dress to the adorable donkey, were smitten with Britt Spring s photography, The Passion Of Flowers  approach to blooms and overall a day infused with animals and a whole lot of love.'
p1945
aS'From The Bride We definitely had a bit of an animal theme going on with a side of cowboy and American Ranch thrown in for good measure.Our decorations came from all over the place: charity shops, antique shops, Etsy, Ebay and my Nan, and were mostly sourced by me in the months leading up to the wedding.'
p1946
aS'Our invitations (which I designed) featured two chickens so these kind of became our emblem. My favorite decorations were the two feathered life-size chicken that I ordered from the States. They kept a watchful eye over everyone from the bar all night.'
p1947
aS'I really wanted antler chandeliers but these are generally quite expensive   eventually I found the ones we had randomly at Next.Then there were vases, animal planters, chalk boards, wagon wheels. vintage signs, fake animal heads and brass animals. Paper decorations for the marquee were custom made by FunkyFrillsUK from Etsy. Each table was named after an animal so for the name places I bought lots of Childrens plastic animals and spray painted them white, in fact I was up early doing this on the morning of the wedding! I used kraft tags and hand stamped all of the names.'
p1948
aS'Will and I met through two of our best friends, the best man and one of the bridesmaids, who met at university and are now married. I always knew I wanted to get married in North Norfolk as it s where I grew up and it s a really special place but we were very lucky to find Scaldbeck House as it had only just been refurbished and the owner agreed to apply for a licence so that we could have our wedding there. The thing that did it for us was the view looking out over Morston Harbour, which is a bit wild and of course those big Norfolk skies.'
p1949
aS'One of my best friends, Charley (who did an amazing reading of Roald Dahl s Cinderella at the ceremony) is a wedding planner and has a fantastic blog called London Bride. I was quite daunted by the task of choosing a photographer but she recommended a few and I loved Britt s work. Beautiful, stylish and memorable and not a hint of cheese. Also she is very happy and relaxed which is great as Will and I are both terrible at having our photos taken usually.\n'

But accents aside, there s beauty bursting from everywhere thanks to help from Bow Occasions  and every draped fold in the bride s Monique Lhuillier gown. Just take a peek at this video from Wedding Film Studio and prepare your feet to be swept.'
p1965
aS'Planning the wedding was a dream for me. With the help of my amazing parents and my wonderful in-laws, we were granted everything we could have hoped for for our big day. The first thing we decided on was the venue, Oli s family home in Kent, Little Bedgebury Farm. We fell in love with the idea of having a chic country wedding at a place that felt personal to Oli s family and mine. The rest was a breeze, from finding our wonderful photographer, Sophia Hanbury, to choosing Simon at Wedding Film Studio to document the day, to Oli s favourite part of the planning process, deciding on the cake!'
p1966
aS'The day itself couldn t have gone any better. The weather was perfect, we had our closest friends and family around us, and the setting was dreamier than I could have ever imagined. Simon did an incredible job in capturing all of this and more. Our families have watched the DVD of the wedding more times than they can count, and every time Oli and I watch it, we get transported back to the best day of our lives.'

S'Destination weddings don t get better than a 3-day extravaganza in France. With 70 guests from every corner of the globe, this gorgeous duo treated their friends and family to the experience of a lifetime   all while pulling off a dream wedding in the process. Polly Alexandre captured the magic at Chateau La Durantie and the gallery is filled one perfect moment after another.'
p2009
aS'From Polly Alexandre  Cassie and Benjie met through work and had a whirlwind romance. They have a great sense of fun and absolutely love each others company, partying together as well as building a life together and supporting each other.'
p2010
aS'Benjie used to be a ski instructor and this sense of fun and adventure is at the heart of their relationship. For honeymoon they even went heli-skiing in Santiago in Chile!'
p2011
aS'Cassie fell in love with Chateau La Durantie in Lanouaille in the Dordogne region of France. It offered them the opportunity to host a house party style wedding, with their close friends and family staying in the Chateau or nearby for the whole weekend. Rumour has it the night before the wedding was *almost* as much fun as the wedding itself!'
p2012
aS'A traditional ceremony took place in the local church in the village before a drive through the beautiful countryside to the Chateau, with summer cocktails served on the terrace and lawns accompanied by a local jazz band.'
p2013
aS'From the Bride  Growing up I never allowed myself to think about my  dream  wedding for fear of jinxing it but after Benjie s romantic proposal in St. Petersburg on our 1 year anniversary my imagination was given carte blanche to create the perfect party in an idyllic location. We both love to travel and with one of our top priorities being fine food and wine France became the focus of the search.'
p2014
aS'When I came across the stunning Chateau La Durantie I knew that we had found our dream destination. We gave ourselves 18 months to organise the wedding which flew by. One of the best things about a destination wedding was that it gave us (and family members) the excuse to go out to France beforehand in the name of research, and the more we visited the more we loved it. When Benjie and I first talked about what we wanted our wedding to be like the answer was always  it s got to be one huge party with the people we love most in the world. '
p2015
aS'With the chateau being such a beautiful backdrop I wanted effortless, relaxed glamour to complement the natural surroundings and chose a palette of greys, pale pink and lilac. The stationery was created from scratch by our designer, who struck the perfect balance between elegantly stylish and not too feminine. My bridesmaids wore dresses in grey chiffon from Dessy, and were all allowed to choose their preferred style as I wanted them to wear something they felt suited them best and to be comfortable. Flowers were pale pink peonies in the bridal party bouquets and rustic displays in wooden planters for the tables, incidentally the tables were all named after ski resorts as a nod to our shared passion.'
p2016
aS'Planning a 3-day extravaganza abroad for 70 guests is a logistical challenge at the best of times but none of it would ever have happened without the extraordinary Charlotte, our planner, who solved issues left, right and centre whilst keeping me calm throughout   an absolute angel.'
p2017
aS'With guests traveling from all 4 corners of the earth we wanted to make their trip worthwhile and get to spend enough time with loved ones without being rushed, therefore a 3-day event was the obvious solution. On Friday night we had a sumptuous dinner in a local restaurant (complete with impromptu karaoke on the coach on the way home) and on the Sunday following the wedding we made the most of the blue skies with a huge BBQ and pool party.'
p2018
aS'The use of local produce was very important to us and where possible all food and wine was local and organic, instead of a traditional cake we had a tower of French cheeses draped with fruits and artisan breads available next to it. My mouth still waters when I think of that cheese tower, it was impossible to do it justice but we gave it a good go!'
p2019
aS'Looking back through Polly s photos never fails make me smile. I can almost hear the jazz band playing as we sipped cocktails on the lawn and feel the warmth of the sun as it started to set across the rolling French landscape. We are blessed to have had the happiest day of our lives captured so perfectly, I hope you enjoy looking!\n'

p2036
aS'From the Bride  For a long time I couldn t understand what type of dress I needed. I searched all of the shops, and purchased and returned every dress. Desperate, I started to search the web and saw a dress I was completely in love with. I ordered it, and it arrived five days before wedding  but it wasn t my size, so I found a seamstress who made it fit perfectly. There is different story about shoes   I think I tried them on for a week, then for what seemed like my whole life. I trusted everything about the flowers (circlet of flowers, bouquet and boutonniere for Vadim) to magic girl Daria Dolonogova. I didn t know how everything should look and I just sent her photos of our clothes and explained the style of the wedding.'
p2037

aS'From the Bride  When Dan and I began planning our wedding, we knew we wanted it to be a laid-back, fun, and beautiful adventure to bring our closest friends and family together. We found Villa Amor on Style Me Pretty and loved what we saw. We planned a quick weekend getaway to travel to Mexico and immediately fell in love with not only Villa Amor, but the whole town of Sayulita.'
p2067
aS'I love any and all DIY projects. I started with our wedding invitations, which included RSVP cards that were written like Mad Libs. When I was done, I still had extra fancy paper which I wanted to use for another wedding project, I just didn t know what yet.'
p2068
aS'I started thinking about table names and wanted to do something unique. All of our guests were Americans and the majority of them spoke limited or no Spanish. I thought it would be fitting to have table names after Spanish love or wedding words. Then at each table, the table name was displayed similar to a Spanish   English dictionary. For example, our table name was  La Boda,  which means  The Wedding  in English. I also made place cards with the same matching paper as the table names.'
p2069
aS'Another fun DIY project I did was the wedding maracas. I ordered plain painted pink and purple maracas online from a party store. Then a girlfriend and I drew Mexican folk art hearts (Milagros) on each maraca using gold Sharpie. There was a maraca at each guest s seat at the dinner table.'
p2070
aS'I would have loved for every item at my wedding to be a DIY project, but time didn t allow for that, so I turned to Etsy, where I ordered tags for the maracas,  Hola!  welcome bags, and wedding programs.'
p2071
aS'I also made a  Wedding Day Survival Kit  for my husband-to-be. I ordered custom cuff links from Etsy. Each cuff link was a map; one of Sayulita, the other of our home, San Francisco. I also ordered custom collar stays from Etsy that were engraved with our wedding date.'
p2072
aS'Our wedding ceremony was at Don Pedro s Palapa on a gorgeous bluff overlooking the ocean. Dan s aunt performed our ceremony and we each wrote our own wedding vows. Then guests were shuttled to the  Gran Villa  at Villa Amor. Guests enjoyed fresh coconuts and cocktails on the patio of the Gran Villa overlooking all of Sayulita. Next we moved to the brick courtyard for dinner and dancing. Dinner was delicious; we opted against cake and instead had a couple making fresh churros on the patio for dessert all night long.

S'Truth: it doesn t take much to make a Hawaiian wedding pretty.  But when you have a fab team of vendors coming together to create a natural, yet totally elegant day of inspiration, it s an entirely new level of amazing.  Think Hana Wedding Co., Kaua Wedding Photography, and Opihi Love Boutique Rentals & Event Design joining forces for a day that will take your breath away.  See it here. '
p2099
aS'From Hana Wedding Co  You can feel the love between Kea and Bryan. The moment s captured by Kaua say it loud and clear. They were the first to come to mind when deciding we wanted to do this styled shoot. And gave an immediate yes  to our asking! Once we had them aboard, the pieces fell together and we were able to create a beautiful day for them to share. The day started with Kea getting pinned, curled, braided and beautified by Kayzlen. Once she was ready, she slipped into the gorgeous silk gown by Tamara Catz ready to meet her man to enact a enchanting Maui day of two people in love.'
p2100
aS'Gifted by a generous local family with a private oceanside location in H na to set our scene, the vision in our head came together. Set against one of the most stunning backdrops the Hawaiian islands have to offer, Kaua Wedding Photography has the ability to bring each moment to life, letting us relive it all over again. We set up a seaside picnic for Kea and Bryan filled with yummy treats by some of our local artisans. The couple clinked their glasses of Blueberry mojitos toasting their commitment to one another.'
p2101
aS'Our inspiration was the sea, colors of blue, shades of white, showing throughout from the recycled glass place settings to the vintage bottles found on the grounds of the old sugar cane plantation of H na to the Liquid Sunshine Jewels adorning the bride and groom. Using only locally sourced flowers our florist, Jessica, created a exquisite bouquet and arranged the complementing stems for the bottle collection centerpiece set atop a rustic dining table from Opihi Love Vintage Rentals dripping with native seagrass. Pulling from our collection of table top glassware, accessories and accents to complete the design, a spectacular table was set. As we all looked on in positive joy at the beauty that was made at our hands, we were reminded of why we do this  because we love it! We love creating beautiful things for others to enjoy, it brings us happiness and fulfillment in making the dreams of our clients come true.'

S'Smaller, intimate weddings are always some of my favorites.  And when that intimate shindig happens to take place in the lovely little locale known as Belize, well  even better.  Because what could possibly be more romantic than tying the knot, toes in the sand style, with only your closest friends and family?  See every heartwarming moment captured by Alea Lovely in the full gallery.'
p2127
aS'From the Bride  After knowing each other for over half of our lives, we decided it was the perfect time to make our relationship and commitment to one another official. With having our family on the West Coast, friends on the East Coast and others abroad, we knew that most of our guests would have to travel across the country one way or the other, so we wanted to make it worth their while to travel. I have a very large family and Kyle has a very small family, so we didn t want to overshadow the day being about the two of us. We decided on an intimate destination wedding and a reception at home later to celebrate.'
p2128
aS'After flipping through the book  501 Must See Destinations  our eyes landed on the Blue Hole in Belize. We read that Belize hosted the largest coral reef in the Western Hemisphere (second in the world to Great Barrier Reef), it was English speaking, accepted US currency and was an easy flight. We decided to escape the snowy weather in February and head south to the warmer climate.'
p2129
aS'For our twenty-two guests, we rented a cluster of villas  family style  on the beach of Ambergris Caye and planned adventures of snorkeling, fishing, and sailing mixed with sipping on cocktails and relaxing on the beach. Once the morning of the wedding arrived, we were in full  vacay mode.   We started with breakfast and delicious smoothies poolside while guests took in massages, manis and pedis. After taking a swim in the pool and sipping on the local Belikin Beer, the guys and gals parted ways to get ready for the main event.'
p2130
aS'Before getting my make-up done, Kyle smartly sent over a wedding gift to me knowing tears were inevitable. It was a gorgeous gold locket laser etched with a photo of me and my recently departed grandma with a lovely message inside ( She may be gone, but this special day, she walks down the aisle with you ) and the wedding date. It hung off of a vintage bow pin so that I was able to wear it on her dress. In addition, our friend, Vonnett, loaned her own grandmother s diamond and sapphire wedding ring for my something borrowed, something old and something blue.'
p2131
aS'In return, I sent Kyle a gift of  something old, new, borrowed and blue  in a small leather chest. The something old was represented by notes scratched on binder paper that were saved from high school and attached to a bottle of Kyle s favorite Balvenie scotch, aged 17 years, the same amount of time we had known each other. The something new was a tie clip stamped with the coordinates of the wedding venue in Belize, which was also secretly engraved on the inside of his wedding band. The something borrowed was probably the most special to Kyle. Being that both of our grandfathers and fathers served in the military, I  borrowed  each of their dog tags. The something blue was a blue silk-screened tie with Kyle s favorite B-17 bomber printed on it.'
p2132
aS'Since we weren t having an official wedding party, Kyle gave the guys Beers Not Bombs  Wingman  bottle openers which were made from reclaimed copper from nuclear wiring. This was symbolic to us since we met in high school and our mascot was the  Bombers , named for the nearby Hanford nuclear plant that helped create the WW2 atomic bombs and where Kyle s dad is was an engineer. Also, the proceeds went to Doctors Without Borders and nuclear cleanup. For the ladies, I thanked them for coming to help me  tie the knot  with sterling silver love knot earrings from Cate & Chloe.'
p2133
aS'Once I slipped into my Candy blush Monique Lhuillier gown and Vonnett placed on my veil, we were ready to roll. The ladies walked on the beach together a quarter mile to the wedding venue where Kyle and the guys were waiting. Before walking down the aisle, I was escorted by my mom and sister to have a  first look  with my dad and brother. After many tears and hugs, my brother walked my sister and mom to their seats before I walked hand in hand with my dad to meet Kyle. We were married by our good friend, Denis, who hosted a perfect ceremony of love, symbolism and full-heartedness.'
p2134
aS'After the ceremony, we enjoyed a cocktail hour with delicious appetizers, a bar stocked with rum drinks and Belikin Beer while listening to the Cuban guitarist jam on. Sitting on the beach we dined on snapper, rib-eye and seafood stew for dinner followed by bananas foster and key lime pie for dessert. Both of our dads and brothers gave  unscripted  toasts that we followed up with music and some dancing. As everyone has told us, the day went by too quickly, but we took every moment in as much as we could, we thankfully have wonderful photos and video to help us remember and reflect.'

I watch a lot of these, but something about this got to me. Be Authentic Photography s keen camerawork certainly helped, but I think it s the love part. So make sure you have someone close by to hug and enjoy the film!'

aS'Later the beautiful couple escaped to the reception located in a beautiful large barn on a private farm that had been renovated to host special events. Its deep rich old oak beams and large wooden doors set the tone for a memorable evening filled with cake cutting, speeches, dancing, and an incredible sparklers exit that was truly one of a kind. It s the kind of wedding that will not be easily forgotten.\n'

S'It s always beautiful to see couples embrace diverse backgrounds so wholeheartedly. Getting an insider tour of Havana doesn t hurt, either. We also have to give props because on top of wedding planning this couple also coordinated a group effort to bring supplies for the ceremony.Yay teamwork! We re glad they did because now we get to enjoy a whole gallery of Matt Kennedy s lovely photos.'
p2224
aS'Choosing a destination like Cuba with its scarcity of supplies, meant having to bring a lot of our own food & personalized decorations: from signage, napkins, candy bowls, candy, votive holders to desserts and even cigar cutters. We had friends and family help us bring them over making this wedding a truly collective effort!'
p2225
aS'The wedding day was planned around giving our small group of guests a great Havana experience: some guests were visiting Havana only for a few days and we wanted to show them sites that took them to different districts in the city: from the cocktail reception in an old restored peanut factory to the two venues for the wedding: The ceremony took place in the garden of one of the oldest hotels in Havana, guests then enjoyed a classic Cuban car ride taking them into the heart of Old Havana for a rooftop reception overlooking the city as the sun set.'
p2226
aS'To add to giving our guests a great experience, one thing we wanted to do was to ensure every guest was thanked. We took great care to ensure that each guest s name card on the table had a personal message of gratitude written for them inside'
p2227
aS'The favorite moment of the day was definitely the reception, where we both got to relax, kick up our feet, forget about all the worries and being able to just enjoy the evening with our amazing guests.'
p2228
aS'Instead of a traditional wedding cake, we had wedding cheese cake (which was difficult to source in Havana anyways); 16 different types of artisanal cheeses weighing around 6 kilos, made in a small cheese shop in Philip s hometown in the North of Sweden and carried all the way over to Havana for us all to enjoy.'
p2229
aS'The one thing that will remain most special to us is to see all our family and friends closest to us gathered from around the world in one place together. It was truly overwhelming to see everyone representing a part of our lives in Havana for the wedding. It was spectacular.'
p2230
aS'From Matt Kennedy Photography It was such an honor to travel to Cuba to photograph Christine and Philip s beautiful wedding. They both have so much connection with Cuba from their travels, and their desire to share that with their friends and family was so apparent. They worked tirelessly to arrange everyone s travel and accommodations in a very difficult country to communicate with from a distance. It was a pleasure to see such warm and inviting people from all over the world, come together to support such a great couple.'
p2231
aS'Their wedding was impeccable, and perfectly planned from beginning to end of the entire week. The details that they had worked on, and the special things they did to treat their guests like royalty were incredible. One of my favorites was the specially made cocktails by one of their groomsmen who is a cocktail genius in the food and beverage industry in Dubai, it was a great personal touch. Christine was glowing in her Monique LHuillier dress, and Philip didn t look too bad himself! Everything was just such a joy to photograph and really be a part of.\n'

S'Just this morning I was scheming up a tropical vacation with my hubs. Somewhere sunny with ocean views and lots of downtime. Somewhere like Maui. I m pretty sure that vacation dream spawned from this very wedding. Captured by Braun Photography and Ohana Films with details by White Orchid Weddings and the prettiest classic blooms by Teresa Sena Designs, this is the true definition of tropical romance.'
p2392
aS'From Braun Photography Kelsey + Andrew s wedding was nothing short of a good time and the Olowalu Plantation House was the perfect location. The entire weekend was full of family + friends traveling from all over to celebrate the love of these two. It was such a pleasure join along on the fun and we are so excited to share it with you! From The Bride   Our vision for the wedding was for it to be intimate and special for all of our family and friends. We relied on the beautiful scenery of Maui to provide bright, vibrant colors for the back drop while using custom touches to make it unique for the two of us. We definitely had a group effort for all of the details of our wedding. The majority of the work was done by my amazing mom, Kathy. To start off, Andrew and I designed our save the dates, programs, unplugged wedding handouts and name cards. We also designed and handmade all of invitations with the help of my mom. Then we custom designed and stitched each of the beautiful table numbers and quotes used throughout the wedding. My mom hand sewed my belt for my wedding dress and all of the bunting that was strung across the venue. My mom hand sewed our names and wedding date into the bottom of my dress in blue for my  Something Blue.  She also sewed my parent s wedding rings onto my garter for my  Something Borrowed.  We wanted a little bit of home incorporated into our wedding. All of the corks used for the name cards came from wineries in the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York, where Andrew is from. My aunt Jeannie and grandma collected pictures of our grandparent s who had passed and put them in small frames that were attached to my bouquet.  What advice would you offer to someone planning their wedding now? From the Bride,  Start early, keep open communication and don t stress the details. It will all come together eventually. Andrew and I tried to enjoy the planning process (as much as possible) and in the end we have fun memories of planning it together with our parents. Also, if you are planning a destination wedding, we would recommend getting all of your guests together at least once before the big day. We planned a snorkeling excursion which was great. We felt like it broke the ice and everyone was able to relax and enjoy the wedding ceremony and reception.  '

Dive in right here.'
p2408
aS'From Sarah Falugo  Kellie and Richard couldn t have chosen a better location, or day for their fun-filled seaside wedding in Cornwall. Polhawn Fort has a peaceful history and is now used for exclusive hire for private parties and weddings. It has it s own private beach, large lawns over-looking Whitsand Bay and tonnes of atmosphere inside the cavernous walls.'
p2409
aS'Richard and Kellie spent many months planning the wedding down to the finest details. The outdoor ceremony was accompanied by a string quartet. After the  i dos  they enjoyed canapes and lawn games in the sun and took a walk on the beach. This Cornish wedding was laid back and fun from start to finish.'
p2410
aS'Kellie couldn t decide which shoes she liked best so decided to get four pairs! The dress was a bespoke piece from Stephanie Allin and the bridesmaids wore a simple blue Dessy number. Everything was offset perfectly with the gorgeous flowers from Forbesfield.'
p2411
aS'At sunset Kellie and Richard slipped away with their photographer, Sarah Falugo for a few shots in a golden wheat field   sometimes those photo opportunities are too good to miss! The 8-piece funk band, Freshly Squeezed kicked the evening party into gear and by all accounts the celebrations carried on until the wee small hours!\n'

S'Intimate weddings never fail to make me stop and stay awhile, particularly when it just happens to be as stunning as this Costa Rica wedding planned by Tropical Occasions. It s simply overflowing with a whole lot of lovely and a whole lot of love, making this gallery from Emily Elizabeth Photo just magic.'
p2438
aS'From Emily Elizabeth Photo Chris and Lori s wedding was a small intimate family affair on the beach in Costa Rica. It was at the end of the rainy season, and down poured on our drive to the ceremony, but cleared up just in time and ended up a perfectly beautiful day. '
p2439
aS'From The Bride Chris and I both grew up in beach towns in different countries. So a beach wedding was created to bring two ocean cultures together. Our families and friends enjoy learning about new places and cultures so we thought that Costa Rica was the perfect location for everyone to join us from abroad. By gathering images and ideas and communicating with our wedding planners, Jaime and Aimee from Tropical Occasions, we were able to narrow down the feel we were searching for. We were inspired by colors and textures of the beach. The style was meant to be kept simple, fresh and soft since it s a smaller intimate wedding. We kept the glasswear in the blue/green color palettes which echo back the theme of the ocean. The wedding planner worked with a local florist to provide flowers and bouquets in the same soft color palette. All of this fit perfectly together thanks to the efforts of so many people and the contributions from everyone we know.\n'

S'This, my friends, is Italian wedding romance done right. And we have David Bastianoni to thank for serving up all the pretty in the form of this sunlit gallery. With Villa La Vedetta as the backdrop and an adorably happy Bride & Groom, look no further than this for laid back love in Italy!'
p2480
aS'From David Bastianoni  Florence is one of the most famous destination wedding cities in the world, its beauty and its romantic atmosphere have allowed me to photograph this magnificent Jewish wedding celebration organized by Fabrizio Mengasini which took place in the Synagogue of Florence and thereafter continued in one of the most beautiful Villas of Florence with a breathtaking view of the city.'
p2481
aS'The religious wedding which took place in the early hours of the afternoon, allowed me to give a romantic theme with natural colors and lighting to the photography as sunset drew near.\n The morning started off early that day in the Villa, whilst the future Bride and Groom were left to relax and enjoy their breakfast, the group of hairdressers and make-up artists took care of all the ladies.'
p2482
aS'Once the bride and her close female family members went into the matrimonial suite apartment, her own personal make-up artist and the hairdresser chosen at the hair trial focused all their attention on her. The lighting in the room was perfect and we were able to take some fantastic shots of the preparation activities.'
p2483
aS'The guests were all ready and followed the wedding planner to the transfer bus awaiting to transport them to the Synagogue. My assistant joined them to capture some photo shots.'
p2484
aS'The Synagogue in Florence is by far, one of the biggest and most beautiful Synagogues in Italy. The emotion that one feels on entering is unique and unforgettable, the singer that the couple had chosen together with the Rabbi and the wedding planners, played an important part in creating this magical atmosphere. Many different special moments captured in my photo shots of the ceremony, express, by themselves the emotions and the atmosphere experienced by the wedding couple, family and guests.'
p2485
aS'At the end of the wedding ceremony, the guests were invited to the exit and once they reached the exit door, they were each given a white balloon which allowed me to take some beautiful photo shoots of a moment that everyone present, including myself and my assistant, a once off natural emotion of joy to an important moment of wishes towards the couples love for each other. The embraces and wishes of all the guests to the couple were endless as they were offered water to drink by the wedding planners and departed towards their bus.'
p2486
aS'The newlyweds left in their own personal wedding car and I followed them to take some intimate photo shoots around the beautiful romantic city of Florence, whilst my assistant went directly to the welcome cocktail to capture some shots of the guests.'
p2487
aS'The welcome cocktail served on the garden pool terrace was definitely inviting with its beautiful Italian sunshine highlighting the lucky couple s special day. Guests enjoyed the delicious variety of finger food and prosecco wine whilst the artists of the live music band, all dressed in white attire began cheering everyone up. It was a very special moment, you could breathe festivity in the air and the guests surrounded by the festive Italian atmosphere under the beautiful blue sky had now embraced the romance of this Italian wedding.'
p2488
aS'The cocktail was only the first moment of joy, the guests, in fact were unaware of the decor that had been organized on the beautiful terrace overlooking Florence as they began to climb the stairs to go to the sit-down dinner. Once on the terrace, their faces lit up and they let off a sigh of surprise as they reached the wonderful upper terrace decorated in white, with square tables and beautiful dainty orchids set as centerpieces.'
p2489
aS'The band with Jewish and non Jewish music cheered the guests up so much that, before they sat down for the formal wedding meal they began to dance and give life to the festivities. Part of the terrace had been left free so that there was a dance area and a dinner area. An open Bar was also placed on one side so that the guests could freely go and enjoy their favorite cocktails and drinks.'
p2490
aS' The square tables that seated 8 persons were decorated with tall glass vases containing a cascade of beautiful orchids and various glass cylinders in different dimensions with candles. A big important decision was the choice of the chairs but in the end chiavari chairs in the natural colour of wood were chosen and they beautifully harmonized with the color of the trees around us.'
p2491
aS'The food was strictly kosher, it was served on various food stations and included the caprese corner with various cheeses, the vegetable corner, the fish corner and the pasta corner. The various food stations had a large variety of dishes and was served by waiters.'
p2492
aS'The sun was setting and the atmosphere became always more intimate and romantic. Fabrizio Mengasini had designed a lighting based mainly by candlelight. In fact, along the entire perimeter of the terrace there were bowls hanging from a line with candles and along the balustrade of the terrace, glasses with a heavy base containing candles.'
p2493
aS'The various cylinders used for the table centerpieces lit up the table area for the guests. This magical atmosphere was also helped by the color amber, which is the facade of the Villa and typical Italian cypress trees.'
p2494
aS'But one of the most vibrant moments was the cutting of the cake with a backdrop view of the city of Florence. The cake prepared in front of the guests by the master chef, delighted the curious guests for about 20 minutes, confetti and streamers accompanied the cutting of the cake, then the band that played music and sang songs, everyone had a wonderful, unforgettable evening and danced until midnight.\n'

S'If your guests are traveling across the Atlantic anyways, why not make a week out of it, right? That s the approach Ali and Zach took when planning their Italian nuptials, and we re sure glad they did. This stunning wedding week started in Florence and ended with the ceremony in Portofino, with lots of vino, fireworks, and dancing along the way. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the enchanting film from Carmen and Ingo.'
p2577
aS'From Carmen and Ingo Photography We are photographers by heart but we now and then do wedding videos for our clients too. Normally they are about 4-5 minutes and just a little add on to the photos.'
p2578
aS'Summer last year, we had this american (New York based) couple that wanted photos of their week long wedding in Italy. Florence and Portofino. They also asked for video. Since it is a bit to hard to compress 5 days in 5 minutes, we have produced an almost 12 minutes feature film for them.'
p2579
aS'The photos have still not been published actually, as the B&G wanted them to be in a print magazine somewhere in the US. However, we are allowed to release the feature film and since it was such a spectacular wedding week, we wanted to try if you are willing to feature one of our videos as well.'
p2580
aS'The Pre Events Florence was the original place selected for the big affair, but with the hot temperatures known for that time the year, the couple decided to weave Florence in a different type of fashion. Thus was borne the #Zachitali adventure   a caravan starting overlooking the city of Florence, woven through the streets of the ancient city through a special scavenger hunt, and capped with a bus ride to beach party destination of Santa Margherita Ligure, and ultimately, Portofino.'
p2581
aS'Wedding Party Fashion Frustrated with the options available in-store, the Bride wanted everything customized. Bridesmaid dress fabric was hand-selected by the Bride and her designer sister-in-law to glisten in tones of champagne, gold, and blush peach to accent the natural colors of the Ligurian coastal towns, and especially the venue. Each girl s body was taken into consideration to ensure they felt their best on the big day. The Groom s tuxedo was created bespoke by an Italian tailor, and the bride s veil was lined with Italian lace to give her otherwise modern Peter Langner gown a more old world feel. Vintage pieces were purchased for everyone in the party by the Bride at Pippin   from old cufflinks to 1920 s rhinestone drops.'
p2582
aS'Pre Ceremony Musicians and Memory Table From the moment guests arrived at La Cervara, they were to receive a feast of the senses. Mandolin and accordion players greeted them as they exited the vans, wielding tambourines draped with ribbons for guests to join in to the music. A  swan song  cocktail was there as an early refreshment   which was a crisp mix of St. Germain cucumber and champagne. Guests had polaroids to snap their photos to include in the guest book for the bride and groom, laid out for them on a table bedecked with vintage frames and the weddings of the bride and groom s ancestors. Flower pots hung from the ceiling, framing the cloisters and teasing the guests with visuals of the garden to come.'
p2583
aS'Ceremony The ceremony was designed as a celebration of not just Zach and Ali, but of the world of friends and loved ones that had flown across the ocean to share in the special week. To shield their heads from the sun and the ladies  faces from perspiration, straw fans and panama hats were given out, along with parasols as an additional cooling agent. To dip the guests right into the fantasy that would ensue that evening, an acrobat danced in the air on white silk to capture the guests attention as they waited. Ali s Rabbi from her hometown temple who married her parents, sister and brother officiated, signs and rings and flowers were carried by her niece, nephew, and custom music was selected to cue each special moment, from Music of the Night for the Bride s entrance, to The Saints go Marching In to pay homage to their love of New Orleans jazz.'
p2584
aS'Pre Reception D cor...Zach and Ali cultivated their relationship over a love of literature, sharing life s synonyms via their favorite excepts from the likes of  The Power of One,   Pillars of the Earth,  and  Great Gatsby.  Each book housed the seating arrangements, scribbled elegantly in gold on old fashioned bookmarks. Their head table of course held the name of the F.Scott Fitzgerald work that inspired their wedding   The Great Gatsby. As favors for their guests, Ali and Zach commissioned a custom work done by an Italian artist   an etched representation of their week-long Italian adventures, encased in old ink and wine bottles as a nod to the proximity of the sea at their venue. To set the tone for the journey through time, straight to West Egg, Ali and Zach had a 20 s style jazz band to get guests right into the jazz age during the  aperitivo,  as they noshed from an authentic Italian cheese table, a Ligurian fish bar, and sipped on custom cocktails pulling from the freshest local ingredients.'

aS'The wedding was the Grand Finale  mined with surprises for the guests  utter delight. Every half hour brought a new treat   be it masks to mimic a Venetian masquerade, beads nodding again to New Orleans and the Groom s schooling at Tulane, cocktail popsicles, fire dancers, and a photobooth with props brought in from their hometown, set to represent their various passions from cooking (chef s hats) to countries (Italian flags) and baseball (foam fingers, anyone?.) If guests  feet tired from the dance floor, they could find respite in a gentleman and ladies corner, dotted with their very own caricatures by an artist that created them at the welcome drinks in Florence only days before. The nights entertainment was capped off with fire dancers until an even better surprise was given by Ali s father. As Ali s Dad took to the stage to share his speech to his daughter, he asked  do you trust me?  With that, he queued Josh Groban s You Raise me Up over the loud speakers, prompting a burst of golden fireworks arching over the Portofino harbor as Ali s Dad invited her to the dance floor, along with her new husband and his mother, so that they could share the stage and the first minutes as father daughter and mother son.'

S'When it comes to bridal shoots that push the limits of perfection, Pearl & Godiva are our go-to girls. They can translate seemingly ordinary inspiration   in this case, the monarch butterfly   and design an editorial that makes our jaws drop. Of course, bringing on a wildly talented photographer like Paula O Hara doesn t hurt one bit, and the resulting shots are nothing short of stunning.'
p2627
aS'From Pearl and Godiva This editorial shoot and its very color palette was inspired by the colors of a monarch butterfly and also moths, that really was our basis for building this beautiful story. The fact that the roads where near enough to impassable and snow storms on the day of the shoot didn t stop us from telling this sumptuous story. Our creativity for this design was built on looking for the unexpected, stepping outside our own experience and walking around this beautiful house and it s breath taking grounds. Before we start transforming a space, we view it from every angle, gouge out every obliquity of the building itself, and sense its opportunity. We stand and close our eyes and see the evolution.'
p2628
aS'We create depth and layers, interest points, consider possible floor and wall treatment, and slowly build up a foundation. We keep an eye on the way the natural light falls into the room, or where the walls could do with an interest point. We keep a notebook where we jot down a list of things and notes on what we experience. We always start with a natural color palette, and slowly build color up thereafter. Fabrics are rich with possibilities, we play with scale, different heights and shapes. Then we forage and scout, find and keep and in the end curate it all for our clients. Beauty really can be found in the simplest of things '

Well, that dreamy vision became a gorgeous reality for these two lovebirds thanks to Varese Wedding, and thanks to Infraordinario, we can see it all right here.'
p2645
aS'From Get Married In Italy Bride and groom contacted us about 1 year and a half before the wedding. They were looking for a wedding venue where it was possible to organize the ceremony and reception outside. Initially they were interested in Tuscany, but they were also considering the lakes of the Northern Italy and during a short trip in Italy , we showed them this old convent in the Lake Garda countryside. They were immediately impressed by the flowers garden, relaxed atmosphere and historic details. It was fun and exciting to organize the wedding, the couple was happy of our ideas and gave us a lot of inspiration, that we incorporated in the event . Over the years, the bride and groom have racked up more than 2000 hearts of every shape, material and color, with which we decorated the entire venue. The wedding theme was of course the hearts and the color palette was white and grey. The weather on the day was really good and the guests coming from Manchester and other cities in the UK really enjoyed the al frescoe dinner and danced under the stars until late in the night.\n'

S'Intimate and simply gorgeous, this Bride s vision for a  summer camp for grown-ups  came to life in the prettiest of ways. With a stunning South African setting and love pouring out of every pretty picture by dna Photographers, this gallery is as good as they get. See it all here.'
p2698
aS'From The Bride I have rented a five-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for the past eight years, and five years ago, when one of our roommates was moving out, I posted an ad on Craigslist. I received the following response:  Hi! My name is Chris Shirley. I am a 23 year old Structural Engineer. I currently live downtown and am moving out of my current apartment on 1 June. I work on 45th Street. Your apartment looks great. I would like to meet up with you and check it out.  He moved in on June 1, and after a summer spent going to the beach, camping out for Shakespeare in the Park tickets, and walking my dog around Central Park, we fell in love.'
p2699
aS'Christopher proposed in Central Park three years later, and we were married in City Hall with my mother and our best friend as witnesses. We told only our close friends and family, but Christopher wanted to keep our City Hall wedding a secret, because he feared that no one would fly half way around the world for our real wedding if they knew we were legally married. I managed to keep it secret for two months, and then posted this on Facebook:  Christopher Shirley & I got married on November 23, 2011 at NYC City Hall. We weren t going to announce it until after our actual wedding ceremony, but I ve waited over 2 months and I have no patience left. We re married and I love the boy! '
p2700
aS'Christopher is from Johannesburg, South Africa and we love the South African countryside. We wanted to hold our wedding ceremony at his family friends  home and Country Inn, the Caversham Mill in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Luckily, Christophers mother is an event planner, because we both work full-time and are in graduate school part-time. I emailed my mother-in-law a million photos from Style Me Pretty and told her we wanted  summer camp for grown-ups.  We wanted to go river tubing and midnight swimming, and romp around the hills with our best friends. We wanted to sing loudly at night, and take our friends on a game drive to see the Big 5 after the wedding. We also needed a vegan wedding, which was difficult but not impossible to pull off in South Africa. We are both vegans and animal rights activists, and to hear our meat eating friends proclaim that our wedding menu was so delicious they may actually consider going vegan was pretty incredible.'
p2701
aS'The rest, as they say, is history. My mother got her very first passport and flew 14 hours to South Africa. Our best friend married us under three beautiful old trees, and we had the most amazing time with friends and family who flew in from five different countries and four different continents to celebrate our marriage with us.\n'

S'I ve seen a lot of amazing weddings grace the pages of SMP, but this desert beauty at Sossusvlei Lodge captured by Dror Eyal Photography and planned by Christelle Du Toit  is in a a league all of its own. Incredibly intimate and ridiculously stylish (hello gorgeous Jenny Packham  gown from Little White Dress Bridal Shop, I m talking to you ), every moment sitting in this gallery is one for the books.'
p2753
aS'From Little White Dress Bridal Shop Carl and Megan met while serving as Peace Corps education volunteers. Their paths crossed at a Peace Corps conference just outside of Namibia s capitol city, Windhoek. However, the schools they taught at were 200km from each other. This meant for the first 8 months of their relationship, seeing each other meant hitchhiking on the desolate Namibian roads from one town to the next. In 2008 Megan s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and although she was only fifteen months into her Peace Corps service, Megan decided that returning to Salt Lake City was the right thing to do. Carl finished his twenty-four months of service and opted to join Megan in Salt Lake instead of returning to his hometown of Great Falls, Montana. Carl and Megan both started graduate school as they supported Megan s mom through cancer treatment. Fortunately, the cancer treatment was successful.'
p2754
aS'During their time in Salt Lake City, Megan and Carl took every opportunity to travel. In 2011 they traveled to Gold Coast, Australia for the wedding of a dear friend. After the wedding, Megan took Carl around her old stomping ground in Sydney, where she studied in 2003. On the final day of the trip, Megan and Carl visited Taronga Zoo, which Megan bragged to Carl had the best views of Sydney Harbor. While at the zoo, the two came upon a deserted amphitheater used for bird shows that just happened to have a spectacular view of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Then Megan realized Carl was kneeling down next to her. Carl proposed and pulled off nearly the impossible: he managed to surprise Megan. She had been so busy preparing to be in her friend s wedding and planning for the trip that an engagement of her own was the last thing on her mind. The next day, they flew home elated and to a very excited family who, of course, had been in on the whole scheme.'
p2755
aS'Megan and Carl had decided that they would return to country they first met, Namibia, to get married. They knew that marrying in Namibia would pose interesting logistical challenges, but the two agreed it had to be done. Not only were Megan and Carl dying to return to the county they loved, where they fell in love, but Megan s family had planned to visit during her Peace Corps service, but couldn t due to her mother s illness. In the summer of 2011, Megan contacted the Sossusvlei Lodge in the southwestern part of Namibia, located on the border of the Namib-Naukluft National Park, in the Namib Desert. The Namib-Naukluft National Park boasts some of the world s largest sand dunes that are colored an intense burnt-orange, contrasting markedly to the deep blue African sky. The largest dunes are located around an area of the park called Sossusvlei, which is where the Sossusvlei Lodge takes its name. Such a tourist destination would perhaps help entice friends and relatives to join in on the journey. Christelle du Toit, hotel manager and event coordinator of the Sossusvlei Lodge, responded to Megan s initial requests, and they exchanged a few emails coordinating logistics, and in one email, Christelle wrote:  It will be our pleasure to make your request come true.  It felt like a fairy godmother granting a wish, but the requestors had not given much detail. Megan and Carl wanted the wedding to be simple, personal and elegant, but neither had given much thought to wedding details. They two just wanted to travel! Christelle mentioned the menu was pre-set due to the logistics of being literally in the middle of nowhere, flowers would be difficult due to the location and heat, there was no electricity at the ceremony site, they could not accommodate more than seventy people because they only had seventy chairs and they had never put together a rehearsal dinner before.  Fine, fine, fine,  Megan and Carl said. The location and being together were all that mattered. In August of 2011, the bride and groom s parents hosted an engagement party and announced that in two years time, on August 26th, 2013, Megan and Carl would wed at the Sossusvlei Lodge in Namibia and anyone interested in an African adventure should consider joining.'
p2756
aS'Since there were two years to go until the wedding, things did not feel rushed. Megan looked here and there for a wedding dress, but couldn t find a dress that felt right, and would fit the occasion. She d just about settled on a simple, white sundress when she came across Little White Dress Bridal Shop online. The reviews were outstanding and Denver wasn t too far from Salt Lake City. Megan and her mom flew to Denver for a ladies weekend and were blown away by the experience they had at Little White Dress Bridal. The moment Megan tried on Jenny Packham s  Eden  she and her mom were both in love. It was just right: unique, non-traditional, easy to travel with and simply stunning for a Namibian desert setting. Megan always says it wasn t until that moment she realized why women get so excited about a dress. When you find the right one, you just know it.'
p2757
aS'At the beginning of 2013 family and friends got serious about booking their trip. Megan got a little nervous as the guest numbers grew and she considered how little she knew about what the actual wedding would be like. It was a bit of a leap of faith, except that forty closest friends and family were leaping too and there was no turning back. The anticipations and unknowns were thrilling.'
p2758
aS'Arriving back in Namibia put all of Megan and Carl s worries at bay. The country is simply incredible: from the people to the scenery, it felt like returning home. Megan and Carl caravanned with twenty guests, driving four vehicles for five hours, along the lengthy gravel roads from Windhoek to Sossusvlei. At the Sossusvlei Lodge, Christelle was calm and collected as could be, and so happy to meet everyone. She went over the wedding schedule with Megan and Carl, but the details including the actual site would all be kept secret. In the two days before the wedding, guests enjoyed hiking the windswept dunes and photographing wildlife, indulging in delectable food and being consumed by a twinkling, vast, endless night sky.'
p2759
aS'Christelle s team planned a rehearsal dinner at Desert Camp, which is the sister campsite to the Sossusvlei Lodge. While music was not allowed because it could have disturbed the other guests staying on the property, it was not necessary. Namibia is known for its incredible night sky, which is what everyone enjoyed while alongside a bonfire, enjoying ceremonial toasts with delicious South African wine. It was intimate and perfect.'
p2760
aS'Sossusvlei is one of the most famous places in the world to take a hot air balloon ride, and many guests planned to do so the day before the wedding. Unfortunately, a violent windstorm prevented that from happening on August 25th, so the only possible day was the actual wedding day. Megan and Carl along with 20 other guests arose at 4:30am to catch sunrise from a balloon. The rainbow-colored balloons were magnificent as they were slowly heated and filled by huge bursts of fire in the pre-dawn light. Megan and Carl spent their wedding morning silently floating over the Namib Desert, the landscape scarred only by the mysterious fairy-circles below.'
p2761
aS'Carl and his groomsmen, including his best man and the officiant, Ghidewon Arefe, made due by ironing shirts on footstools. Megan s flower girls came to get ready with the bridal party. Christelle told everyone except the bridal party to be ready to leave at 4:15 PM sharp to be shuttled via sand buggy to the wedding site (wherever that was). The bridal party was shuttled out at 4:30 in a sand buggy Christelle and her team tied with a simple ribbon and wreathe. Christelle also personally made a bouquet for Megan of grasses from around the lodge so she would have something to hold as she walked down the aisle. The driver set off straight into the desert, and nothing but grass, sand, mountains and a few sparse trees were in view. Finally the group arrived at a nook at the base of a rocky outcrop with a giant camelthorn tree set between two huge boulders. Christelle hung wooden hearts on the tree that swirled in the desert breeze and lined the aisle with native grasses. Carl and Megan chose a rendition of  Fools Rush In  performed by Megan s aunts for the processional. A lot of time and effort went into the ceremony program, which Megan and Carl were so excited to share with their guests. The first reading was Goodridge vs. the Department of Public Health, the 2003 ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Court that legalized gay marriage, which is an issue close to the hearts of the couple. The bride and groom s parent s helped honor relatives that couldn t be there, those that had passed and also offered advice for the couple entering into their marriage. Next, Megan s brother, Zach, debuted a song he wrote called  Your Someone  on his Key-tar, which he d lugged from Salt Lake along with a battery powered amplifier, since there was no electricity at the site. The  Dude of Honor  read a passage from one of the couple s favorite books, Travels with Charlie. Carl s dad performed the Hungarian tradition of placing a gold and silver coin in the shoe of the bride to symbolize never having to go without, which honored Carl s Hungarian grandmother and the couple concluded the ceremony with the breaking of a wineglass to honor Megan s Jewish heritage.'
p2762
aS'Following a celebratory champagne toast, guests were whisked off to the hidden reception site, which was another five minutes into the middle of nowhere. By this time it was pitch black in the Namibian desert. Megan and Carl were driven separately to the reception behind the rest of the guests. Suddenly the driver stopped in front of a large boulder and told Megan and Carl to walk around the corner. Around the corner was a walkway made of dozens and dozens of flickering candles that seemed to lead into darkness. Arm in arm the new couple moved into the night with faint music as the only promise of life at the end of this path. The music grew louder and louder (luckily the reception site, although incredibly remote, did have electricity, thanks to a well-concealed generator). The couple came upon bonfires, a line of waiters standing before many tables of food and grills. The candles continued up the mountainside and seemed to climb into the starlit sky. DJ Stefan Piem who had traveled five hours on dirt roads from the coastal town of Swakopmund played a mix of old and new songs along with Namibian tunes. Friends had traveled from the USA, Europe and Australia to be there. The late-winter Namibian weather was cold, so guests piled pants, jackets and blankets on top of their formalwear and danced in the firelight darkness of the Namibian desert until 2:00 AM. Many of these guests remarked that they never would have considered traveling to Namibia, but it ended up being the best journey they d ever had. Megan and Carl could not have dreamed up a better way to start their lives as husband and wife.\n'

S'I m a firm believer that travel is the absolute best way to get inspired. There is nothing like stepping out of your comfort zone to really make you stop and look around for a minute. And we can thank  Orange Blossom Photography s trip to Thailand for inspiring this beauty of a shoot. With the help of Occasion9  and One Girl Cookies, that trip came to life on the rooftops of Brooklyn, and you can see it all here. '
p2789
aS'From Orange Blossom Photography .I wanted to capture the elegance of a simple wedding and the mystery of Thailand in the images. The photo shoot was held at one of my good friends rooftop in Brooklyn at sunset. It was hot in New York as it was in Thailand, so it felt pretty realistic.'
p2790
aS' I was inspired after visiting Thailand. I was immersed in such a different culture while I was there and it was simply amazing. That is why I decided to do a Thai infused wedding photo shoot. Though Thai culture gravitates towards bright colors along with gold and silver, I wanted to go for more modern New York style that has hint of Thai culture. We used lots of gold and silver but made the overall feeling more elegant by adding white and lush greens. The model was a good friend of mine who happened to be Thai, so I asked her to be part of it because she was a perfect fit. I purchased her dress while shopping in Bangkok because it was simple yet elegant. I added a sash to the dress for a right amount of sparkle.'
p2791
aS'The pillows, gold and silver chargers and napkin rings were purchased from the local stores such as Pier One Imports and TJMaxx. I couldn t forget to incorporate the elephants! So I purchased the elephant lanterns to remind that its a Thai inspired photo shoot! With incredible floral and table designs by Occasion9 Team, I was able to take a modern, simple rooftop to another level. It was as if we all were transported to Thailand for that time-being.'
p2792
aS'From Occasion9 Floral & Table Design When Julieanne reached out to us for collaboration, we knew this was going to be a fun project. She was sweet and full of enthusiasm. She came to our studio to talk about her trip to Thailand and how she was inspired by the colors of the Thai culture. We could tell that she was totally in love. She wanted to incorporate that into a modern style wedding- a typical New York style.\n We brainstormed together for an hour and came up with an idea of mixing gold, silver, white and green to make it Thai infused New York Wedding photo shoot. It was very fun for us to design the table settings and floral arrangements because it was unique! Everything was handmade. We wanted to make every piece meaningful by keeping the originality of Thai cultural colors.'
p2793
aS'The photoshoot began at 5PM when the sun was still out. As the time went by, the movement of the sun created magical lighting. Even for people with no special photography background could tell how the lighting changed from the first picture to the last. It portrayed true beauty of the nature. It was simply.beautiful. The pictures came out great. Julieanne captured the main theme of this project really well. Our favorite part of all was the great teamwork! We all worked together in timely manner and made this session fun and successful!\n'

S'Simply stated, this wedding is pure elegance and perfection. The getting-ready moments alone are worth their own little slice of time to devour. Anastasia Belik captured every single inch of this powder blue soiree in such a way that they are more than moments, they re works of art. And they re all sitting beautifully in this unparalleled gallery.'

aS'From the beautiful Bride When we got engaged, we already knew we want to have wedding on the countryside. Our good friends recommended us  Oh Marriage!  wedding planners, and we fully trusted them. First they found an awesome country club with Province style interiors for us. So all together we made a decision to do our dream wedding in this stylistics.'
p2820
aS'All the decor on our wedding   work of art from Peony studio. I was totally fascinated by Nastya Belik photography works. Everything   the color, the places, and surely decor! Immediately I realized I want her and only her to make pictures of our wedding   her works are so different from any other pictures of local photographers   Nastya works wonders!) As for the decor from Peony studio   everything is oh so beautiful and harmoniously, you just can t take your eyes off! So I had no doubt they ll create something brilliant for us!'
p2821
aS'I was really lucky to meet all those wonderful people   Katya from  Oh Marriage!  wedding planners, girls from Peony studio   Lyuba and Nastya,   I just felt in love with them, and getting prepared to my own wedding was a great pleasure with their help! They were thinking over every single detail of the wedding and sometimes just in time dissuade me from my crazy ideas, so it helps to have the same style throughout the ceremony, and I m very grateful to them!'
p2822
aS'We ve chosen wedding color palette based on country club s restaurant interiors. Light blue, ivory and beige   everything was created in these shades: from groom s outfit to cupcakes in candy bar! The second wedding s leitmotif was flowers of hydrangea in light blue and ivory colors. It was used in my awesome bride s bouquet, in beautiful decor inside the restaurant and outside at the wedding ceremony area: arch s decoration, flowers on bicycle s basket, sweets in candy bar and much more! Also these flowers were used in polygraph   paper with light blue hydrangea print was pasted into crafted envelopes for invitations. The same hydrangea s print was on seating plan, seating cards and so on.'

aS'Overall I think with decorators prom Peony studio help, awesome Nastya Belik pictures and  Oh Marriage!  wedding planners we ve created the wedding of my dream   so tender end elegant, with a subtle hint of Province.

aS'From Tuscania Events Anna & Christian a beautiful couple from Sweden, chose Italy to celebrate their wedding. Their love for Italian food, the Tuscan countryside and the warm climate made Florence the right choice to celebrate their dream wedding. They rented a recently restored 5 star Villa for all their guests. Villa Tolomei is immersed in the Tuscan countryside but only 5 minutes from the historical center of Florence. Guests could enjoy both the tranquility of the countryside and the beauty of the Renaissance city. The Bride s elegant gown was a reflection of Nordic minimalism and the tuxedo clad guests followed the typical tradition of a Swedish wedding celebration.\n'

S'When it comes right down to it, a wedding shouldn t follow any rules. Because when you throw the  traditional  mind set out the window, you re bound to be surprised how meaningful and true-to-you your wedding day can really be. I m talking about this sweet duo, who threw caution to the wind when they decided to elope in Buenos Aires with a little bit of help from Carmela Hartman and Clari Firmat. One look at Sarah Kate s images of the day and you ll see why this was the best. idea. ever.'
p2901
aS'From the beautiful Bride I ve always known that I wanted to get married abroad. My love of travel and adventure has taken me around the world, even leading me to Florence, Italy, where I lived for six months of my life. I met Jordan soon after moving to Austin, TX, and I realized very quickly that I had found the thrill-seeking and passionate person that I had always been looking for; on our first date, we talked so long that we ended up closing down the restaurant! After dating a little over two years, Jordan proposed and I said YES! Now the biggest question was figuring out where to go.'
p2902
aS'Throwing caution to the wind, we decided to elope in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Jordan lived there after college and was yearning to go back, and it was a destination that I had always wanted to visit. Being a wedding photographer myself, it was very important that I immediately found an amazing photographer to capture our day, and it was such an easy decision once I spotted photos taken by the uber-talented and incredibly lovely Sarah Kate. By happenstance, we were also introduced to Clari Firmat of Tepeino Puntocom who is a native of Buenos Aires. While she started out simply as my hair and makeup artist, our friendship quickly grew over e-mail, and soon she was helping us pick our hotel and shooting locations, offering to drive us around the widespread city and we even decided to have her officiate our wedding. We could not have done this without her. '
p2903
aS'Our  weddingmoon,  as we came to lovingly call it, was more than we could have ever imagined. Among the bustling cobblestone streets, the Paraje de Almas hotel provided a gorgeous backdrop for both getting ready and our ceremony. Although I was an emotional wreck getting through the vows I had written, I knew at least that the blooming jasmine and whitewashed walls would look great for the photos! Alongside Sarah Kate, we had the honor of wedding videography by Ohana Producciones, capturing our story to perfection. After the ceremony, as we were posing for some of the last photos of the day, we heard music across the street. On a whim, Jordan and Sarah Kate pulled me over to the open auditorium where street musicians were performing and we had our first dance right then and there in front of a hundred San Isidro locals. It was a moment I will never forget. The next day, we all piled into Clari s car and went zipping around Buenos Aires, using the city as our backdrop. Traveling in our wedding attire from La Boca all the way to Palermo and Puerto Madero, we felt so fortunate being able to immerse ourselves in the city and its culture.'
p2904
aS'We knew that planning a wedding halfway across the world would bring unexpected and spontaneous moments, but we didn t realize just how sweet this time would truly be. From the incredible people we met to the rich events we experienced, Jordan and I are so happy we took the leap. While it wasn t traditional, our celebration completely reflected who we are as a couple  a perfect way to invest in our memories and lifelong love.\n'

I would hug Julia Wade if I could for the stunning imagery she s filled our galleries with!'
p2948
aS'From Julia Wade  Liz and Jesse are a very special couple for me. They knew their style through and through and knew immediately they wanted their wedding on Block Island, as the destination offered a beautiful blend of their worlds. Liz grew up on a marina in Rhode Island, and Jesse on sprawling acres of farmland in Connecticut. Block Island boasts just that.. 10 square miles of gorgeous beach front, and undeveloped green farmland. All of their details were put together with care, by Liz herself, an event planner from Manhattan. And Waterford Crystal, one of her clients, generously offered the crystal for her big day. Her maid of honor lovingly hand painted all of the escort cards on driftwood, oysters were shucked at the cocktail hour, and the beautiful palette of corals and navy blues was only highlighted by the beauty of the island. My favorite detail was the engraving of Block Island s coordinates inside Jesse s ring.'

aS'I can t begin to tell you the *joy* that was their day. Even the island celebrated with the beautiful weather. I hope you can feel that in these photographs. Thank you again!\n'

S'When a charming, vintage wedding meets the stunning shoreline of Maui, we tend to pay attention. So when this beauty (planned to perfection by Lori Lawrence Of Tropical Maui Weddings and styled by Opihi Love) landed in our laps, we couldn t help but put everything aside and devour all the sweet details snapped up by Kaua Wedding Photography. This gallery is pure pretty, and you can see it all here. '
p2999
aS'From the Bride Maui was the perfect destination for us. The island is gorgeous, the weather is fabulous, and the spirit of the island and its people are exactly what we envisioned for our big day. We decided on our venue   the Olowalu Plantation House   the second we visited it. We had read about it online but when we saw it in person, we knew it would be our spot. Because it is such a naturally beautiful venue, we knew that we wanted to keep our decorations soft, rustic, and romantic, so that everything would blend seamlessly with the ocean, the vegetation, and the gorgeous plantation house on the property. We chose neutral tones for Mike and his brother s suits and a soft buff color for the bridesmaids (and for the handmade ties worn by all the boys), and we combined rustic elements such as burlap runners and old wooden tables, with softer, more romantic touches such as lace, old books, and vintage vases. My stepmother made linen flower girl dresses and ring bearers  shirts, along with an adorable linen ring pillow, which was adorned with lace, a handmade wooden heart with our initials and wedding date, and a buff fabric flower to match the ones on the bridesmaid hair clips, the flower girl headbands, and the flower girl belts (all of which made by my amazingly talented cousin). The gorgeous flowers on the tables and in the bouquets tied all of the colors and themes together and were absolutely stunning.'
p3000
aS'The most important thing to us, though, was that the wedding be as personal and meaningful as possible. We wrote every word of our ceremony and our vows, and we asked one of Mike s childhood friends to officiate for us. It was such a special way for us to share with all of our family and friends exactly how we feel about each other   and also how we feel about all of them. It was a truly magical ceremony and we will never forget a moment of it.'
p3001
aS'We also wanted to incorporate personal touches throughout the wedding d cor. We have two small dogs who we absolutely adore and, although we couldn t fly them out to Hawaii, we wanted to make sure they were there in spirit. So, we had professional photos taken of them (wearing tuxedos, of course) and displayed the photos at both the welcome dinner and wedding. We also put a picture of the four of us on the back of our programs, along with an explanation that our  kiddos  had requested that we make a donation to the ASPCA on their behalf in lieu of a wedding favor. We also incorporated our love for travel with a vintage globe and suitcase, and placed books about knowledge and exploration on each of the tables. Our brilliant stylist, Melissa Padilla, also came up with the super creative idea of cutting out pages of old books and using those to wrap each of the napkins. She also individually potted succulents for each of our guests in lieu of escort cards, which turned out exactly as we had envisioned. (At the welcome dinner the night before, we used old pictures of us with each of our guests as escort cards, and although it was insanely time consuming to find pictures of us with each of our 100+ guests, they turned out great!).'
p3002
aS'A few other small personal touches that we loved: our save the dates looked like vintage Hawaii postcards (tying together our love of travel and our vintage theme); I hand wrapped each of our invitations in lace and ribbon to make each one slightly different and personal; we made super fun welcome bags for all of our guests and stuffed them with lots of goodies and a detailed itinerary for the week; my amazing sister had an adorable sign made for my nephew to carry down the aisle letting Mike know that his bride was on her way; Mike and I wrote and exchanged private, handwritten notes just before the ceremony (and we wrote them in awesome, handmade books that we ll use each year to write notes to each other on our anniversary); we had a rubber stamp made with our initials and wedding date that we incorporated into various decorative elements, from the invitations to the welcome bags to the fans provided to the guests at the ceremony; we made  ring security  shirts for the ring bearers (which they wore very proudly!); we had a bananas foster station that was way more fun than a cake; and we served doughnuts as late night treats since doughnuts hold a special place in each of our hearts (my dad used to leave doughnuts for me and my sisters on Saturday mornings before he would head off to work, and then later on in life, during law school finals, Mike and I would often eat doughnuts from a shop right near our law school).'
p3003
aS'Honestly, we couldn t have envisioned a more perfect wedding and are so thankful to all of our family and friends who joined us in Maui to celebrate, and to all of our incredible vendors who made the day as beautiful and as seamless as it was. We will cherish the memories from that day for the rest of our lives.\n'

S'It s no mystery why Greece is such a sought after destination for weddings and getaways  it s crazy beautiful. It s ranking on my  wanderlist  is pretty high and thanks to Mood Effects and George Pahountis, it just earned a jump up on the  ole list. Blue waters to white-washed chapels and all the love in between, you can feast your eyes to an abundance of pretty right over here.'
p3029
aS'From Mood Effects  We had the pleasure to organize the wedding of a couple that came from New York to Greece to celebrate their wedding. The wedding took place in the middle of August in the suburbs of Athens close to the sea. Coming from different cultures, the bride embraced the Greek origins of the groom and both of them wanted to share and introduce to their guests the Greek customs of a wedding as well as the beauty of Greece within few days. And so they did! With few touches of New York elements. The ceremony was in a small white, very traditional chapel surrounded by beautiful tall trees. Just before the sunset the ceremony begun and it was one of the most romantic and emotional moments of the day.'
p3030
aS'After the ceremony everyone joined the couple for the reception and the party to a private venue next to the sea. The colors of the sunset were enhancing the minimal but impressive architecture as well as the decoration that was placed as centerpieces and all around. White hydrangeas and roses, ivy and candles were selected to match the blue scenery of the view. Few gold details were glowing through the candlelight and kept the  sunlight  after dark.\n'

It would give them a chance to celebrate with family and friends a for a week in the sun, let the resort take care of all the details they did not want to fuss with.

aS'Guests were welcomed with refreshing Mexican fruit waters in bright pink   watermelon flavor   and peach   cantaloupe flavor   that coordinated with the couple s color palette as well as cool towels to keep them comfortable in the warm afternoon. The wedding ceremony took place on the villa garden and beach area where the bride and groom stood beneath a uniquely-styled chuppah created from hand-made Mexican origami fabric, and as the groom kissed his new wife, trumpets sounded from the awaiting Mariachi band while guest shook hand-painted maracas with the words Beso, Kiss, Love and Amor!'
p3115
aS'Cocktail hour ensued, and creative renditions of traditional Latin cuisine were served in bite-size portions; from Agave-glazed shrimp to Chipotle tamales, guests sampled a scrumptious variety of Mexican delights! Lounging areas created from clean white couches and ottomans provided seating for guests in the villa garden, and sweet arrangements of peonies and succulents among other florals added pops of color along with a stunning variety of throw pillows! Vintage chandeliers hung above seating areas and provided a touch of glam and beautiful illumination later on in the night!'

aS'Their love for Greece is what they made them start thinking of having a destination wedding since they live in Seattle. They wanted an island, that was certain. From all the beautiful islands the one that they were feeling very strong about was Paros. Angela had spend most of her childhood vacation there and it was her love of this particular island and Greece that made Jason to see through her eyes that this was the best place to celebrate their wedding. A place full of wonderful memories!'
p3144
aS'Paros has the same architecture as all the Cycladic islands. Blue details to match the color of the sea on all the small white houses that are getting brighter when the sun is shining. The venue and the chapel finally selected, were at the same premises, next to the sea. They agreed to follow the traditions of an Orthodox ceremony and be more romantic and modern as far as the party and the decoration was concerned. Been so close to the sea we thought it would be nice to add few matching details to the decoration.'
p3145
aS'White tends and chairs were placed outside of the small white chapel that was decorated with arrangements of white hydrangeas, white and light pink peonies as well as David Austin roses. During the ceremony the couple followed all the steps of the typical Orthodox ceremony something that was different but impressive for the guests coming from abroad. Everything said and done during the ceremony is symbolic and  prepare  the couple for their common life. The candles, the wine even the three rounds around the table that represent the first steps of the bride and the groom as a married couple.'
p3146
aS'After the ceremony, guests enjoy their Mimosa cocktails while waiting to enter the reception. At the entrance there was a nicely decorated table with small local candies and the  wish pebbles . Sea pebbles inside a sandy colored burlap bag for every guest to write a wish for the couple. A small gift was placed at each guest s place on the table, few sugar coated almond candies wrapped with white and light pink cloth. Every table was named after the name of a Cycladic island and written on a big white pebble placed in the center of the table along with the minimal arrangements of flowers that was surrounded by candles. As the sun was going down the candle lighting was creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.'

S'I think it s safe to say that this wedding will sit high atop my favorites list for a long, long time. First off, Ann-Kathrin Koch, you ve stolen my heart with your insanely gorgeous moments. And the South of France? With surroundings as pretty as this, a simplistic approach to decor complemented by lush florals from 1000 Fleurs was all this fete needed. The result is breathtaking.'
p3176
aS'From the beautiful Bride  We live in NYC but our gracious and kind aunt and uncle opened up their French country home in the south of France for our wedding. A bit off the beaten path an hour south of Toulouse in a town called Castelnaudary. A region known for its rolling hills of sun-flower fields, and le cassoulet, a rich French casserole with duck and sausage.'
p3177
aS'My goal was to achieve as classic and natural a look as possible! I envisioned Carolyn Bessette Kennedy in her wedding gown how modern and elegant she looked! Both the veil and hair-piece were custom made by Sara Gabriel; shoes by Valentino. The bridesmaids wore Jenny Yoo dresses that were convertible, as well as jewelry from Lizzie Fortunato Jewels, a NYC jewelry designer and longtime girlfriend of one of Josh s groomsmen.'
p3178
aS'I was less interested in the  major  wedding gown stores where it felt intimidating and a bit less personal. So I searched for smaller and unique boutiques and found a quaint, warm wedding gown boutique centrally located in Soho New York. I knew I wanted a gown that was simple, with contrasting lines, and a silhouette that was elegant and timeless. I ended up choosing a gown by Ulla Maija called the Felicite. It was simple and unassuming and had a detachable train that I could take on and off if I wanted more of a punch!'
p3179
aS'The photographer was actually one of the vendors I spent the most time making sure to get it right. We spoke with quite a few different photographers that we were recommended as well as one s we found on wedding blogs in the U.S., and U.K. After sifting through portfolio after portfolio we ended up choosing Ann because of her approach to photography. We really wanted to avoid using anyone that was on the  cheesy  side, albeit all wedding pictures can be a bit cheesy to begin with! Ann was fantastic at capturing candid moments and the natural beauty of the setting in France. Ann has a laid back style, where she fit s right in and has a great eye for detail. We absolutely loved the story that Ann ended up capturing on camera for us. It was as if we were re-living the event from start to finish!'
p3180
aS'We had 3 groomsmen and 3 bridesmaids. The bridesmaids wore Jenny Yoo convertible dresses in blush and charcoal, with earrings and necklaces by Lizzie Fortunato Jewels. The groomsmen wore a combination of heather grey suits with a matching blush tie by Emerillo Zegna.'
p3181
aS'Overall the surroundings really were the theme, with us adding accents and details to bring out the natural beauty. We didn t have to do too much, but the tables really turned out beautiful with the chic flower arrangements and rustic finishes.'
p3182
aS'1000 Fleurs, a local florist in the town of Castelnaudary was our florist. She did a wonderful job helping put together bouquets that had warm earthy tones, such as faded pinks and blushes. We brought all of the tins, vases, and table arrangements for the tables, and the florist added her beautiful arrangements to them. We had a few finishing touches of burlap and ribbon runners, and lavender tied in bunches to the end of the tables and chairs.'
p3183
aS'We had a lovely outdoor ceremony and were fortunate to have good Fall weather. Our favorite part of our wedding was reading our vows that we wrote ourselves. We also had a reading from Paulo Coehlo s The Alchemist. We loved having an intimate small wedding of just 50, which allowed us to connect and spend time with each of our guest s throughout the evening and the weekend. The sun came out just as we screamed Mazel Tov, and we were on cloud nine (or the dance floor) the rest of the night!\n'

aS'The scenery was just perfection; it was located in one of the most beautiful terraces of Esperanza Resort. The ceremony was the perfect moment to make a statement, with a bright and joyful setting full of red, orange and pink flowers. We mixed different textures and styles to make it fun and interesting. Working with floral designer Pina is a guaranteed funfest, not to mention her talent for creating the most beautiful arrangements.'
p3227
aS'The reception took place at the restaurant terraces. We created a very graceful, festive and amusing atmosphere. We had fun mixing fabrics, colors, patterns and textures. We added little touches of the desert, like mini cactei and wild flowers. The funniest part was probably the Burro Photo Booth   hard to pick one, but it was probably the most successful element of the wedding; people didn t want to get out of the Burro area where we had props, mask and sombreros.'
p3228
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Find a good wedding planner! I was so fortunate to find Martha and Sarai whom I immediately clicked with and was able to trust fully with executing the perfect weekend. With destination weddings, you have to be able to put your trust in your planner because it is impossible for the bride to take care of the details the way they would if the wedding were in the city they live in. Since I trusted Martha and Sarai so much and spent a lot of time with them before hand going over each detail many times, I was able to just give them some basic ideas on what I liked and envisioned and let them take it from there. When I arrived for the big weekend, I didn t have to do a thing. I was able to enjoy my guests the entire time and everyone commented that I was the most calm bride they have ever seen. Having that calmness was priceless.'

aS'Things I loved the most: The chuppah was absolutely stunning, and the table settings were the most beautiful I have ever seen!!! The donkey was so much fun   our guests loved taking pictures with him when they entered the reception.

Nothing gets a party going better than good music!!\n'

S'France will forever be the land of pure romance. From the streets of Paris, to a wildly gorgeous chateaux in Burgundy it s a total destination dream. And this modern meets classic garden affair crafted by F te In France with blooms by Sol y Flor and photography by Ian Holmes is proving just that. Romance, and a crazy good backdrop like Ch teau de Varennes can all be found right here.'

aS'Jennifer and Julien s wedding took place over a weekend in June at a luxury ch teau in Burgundy. With Jennifer s family coming from North Carolina, and Julien s from all over France, the celebration was truly a fairytale.'
p3274
aS'The theme of Burgundy wine ran throughout the wedding weekend   the couple and their guests spent the weekend visiting wineries, and all of the meals were accompanied by the region s finest  crus .'
p3275
aS'On the day of the wedding, the couple decided to have a  first look  before the ceremony. They were chauffeured to the ceremony area in Julien s father s classic Citro n Traction. The ceremony took place outside on the ch teau grounds where guests watched the couple recite their vows under a beautiful trellis decorated with greenery and white roses. Family friends, who also happened to be priests, performed a touching ceremony. Jennifer and Julien brought a custom-made keepsake box to incorporate into their wedding. The two placed a bottle of wine and love letters to be opened on a later anniversary.'
p3276
aS'The cocktail took place on the patio outside the Orangerie where guests enjoyed signature cocktails based on the  kir royal : champagne with a choice of the traditional cassis (blackcurrant) liqueur, peach liqueur, or coquelicot (poppy) liqueur. Musical entertainment was provided by the talented members of both sides of the family   a cousin of Jennifer s played during the ceremony and cocktail, and a surprise performance by Julien s twin brother and several of their friends rounded out the end of the cocktail. Afterwards, the party moved inside the Orangerie, where the decoration was inspired by the idea of a wild garden, with the colors of sage, pale pinks and peaches, and touches of beige and chestnut.'
p3277
aS'A traditional French dinner was followed by dancing and a dessert buffet complete with a traditional French croquembouche (accompanied by sparklers, of course!). We wish Jennifer and Julien the best as they start their new life together!\n'

S'Just sit with that title for a minute. An intimate winter wedding in Paris? I do believe that equals perfection. And from the looks of all the downright stunning images from One And Only Paris Photography, it most certainly does. Every image sitting in this gallery is frame-worthy to say the least, and you can get lost in the lovely right here.'
p3304
aS'After discussing many options for our wedding (big, small, Australia, Europe, eloping..) we decided that all we wanted was an intimate and relaxed ceremony where all of our family could attend. We wanted the day to be about us and the promise that we re making to each other   rather than table arrangements and co-ordinated bridesmaid dresses! We wanted to make sure that at least our immediate families could attend so location wise, it needed to be near Steve s father in London as he did not fly at the time. My parents were already planning to visit us in London for Christmas; my little brother Sam was due to also be in Europe travelling & my older brother James studying so it made sense to hold the wedding at the end of the year and bring both families together for the holiday period. When we decided this, we had originally planned to host the wedding in London. We wanted a small ceremony followed by dinner, but when we researched locations and venues none seemed  good enough  to warrant us having out wedding there   we d either dined at the restaurants before, visited areas with work and so on. '
p3305
aS'One day Steve stumbled across Weddings in Paris blog, forwarded it to me and we were sold! Whilst Paris wasn t particularly momentous to either of us then, the beauty of the city and that it is foreign feels  special . It is a 2hr train ride from our home in London, the backdrops are just stunning for photography and as everyone says   it s the city of love! Once we had made the decision that the wedding was to be in Paris, our smaller guest list was secured and we knew exactly the  type  of wedding we were going to have. We never really thought to enlist the services of a wedding planner; with a degree in Event Management, wedding planning is something that I always wanted to do before I fell into Marketing, so myself and Steve set out to pull it all together in 8 months. We started by deciding what key elements we wanted in our day, and looked to real wedding blogs of marriages in Paris to get inspiration for locations and vendors. Then it was all about late nights spent on Google researching no end! We had a spreadsheet of all the elements that needed to be confirmed with a rough budget and just worked through that one by one by order of urgency. Some details were more difficult with no local knowledge of Paris & without speaking French but we persisted and at times enlisted the help of Parisian & French-speaking colleagues and friends to make key phone calls, but on the whole it was quite an easy process. '
p3306
aS'I was addicted to wedding blogs (SMP being a favourite!) and was glued to Pinterest for 2012. We loved reading about other people s weddings in Paris, mainly elopements actually, and that s how we fell in love with the idea of an intimate wedding. One & Only s photography was also a constant source of inspiration. I loved the whole day! But if I had to pick just one moment then mine would be finally walking into the beautiful chapel and seeing Steve. It was such an exciting time knowing that the day we had planned for so long was finally starting, as well as our lives together. We had had so many last minute dramas in the week leading up to the wedding and they really didn t stop until I arrived at the chapel (45 minutes late!); but from that point on the day was perfect and ran so smoothly; and as soon as I arrived to him I knew it would as nothing else really mattered anymore. '
p3307
aS'Advice to future brides planning a wedding in Paris: It takes a lot of time and planning; if you are not able to be there physically, or speak the language then it can be frustrating at times   but it is doable! If you re not up for the challenge the enlist the help of Wedding Planner early on to make the most of their service (I suggest Fete in France; we didn t use them but Nancy was very kind to suggest another venue for our evening drinks when our bar closed without notice a week before our wedding!). A lot of vendors will not be flexible so be very clear with your briefs (pictures help!) so that there is no confusion; and be prepared to take matters into your own hands if all else fails, for example   our wedding car hire company did not offer simple white ribbon decoration (just fake flowers which we didn t want), so I brought my own & had my dad affix it to the car when it arrived!

S'It s hard to top a first date on Lake Como, but not impossible! Proof: Julie and Yves whose stunning wedding served their extraordinary international love story perfectly. Masterfully incorporated details like map-themed stationary and curated out-of-town bags for guests that traveled far and wide, gave a tasteful nod to their history together. Just take a look at Michael Moss s photos of the event.'
p3335
aS'From the bride  Let me start by saying that Style Me Pretty was our go-to advisor throughout the entire wedding planning process. Because of Style Me Pretty, I knew the photographer we had to have BEFORE we even got engaged. (I had done lots of research for a friend s wedding.) I think my fianc  and I called Michael Moss within two days of getting engaged because we knew he  needed  to be our photographer. With the help of this indispensable site, I found the amazing Megan Lipke Kenney of Ruby the Fox, who patiently walked me through each step of the invitation design process, giving us the letterpress wedding invitation suite of our dreams and a design for the inside of the envelope that we loved so much we used it for the favors, programs, out-of-town guest bags, and even our seating chart! Because of Style Me Pretty, we also found incredible Lee Morton of Clickspark, who might just be one of the nicest, most passionate-about-his-craft people I know Style Me Pretty was invaluable. Seriously.'
p3336
aS'I first met my husband Yves while I was in Chicago. He was visiting from Switzerland, and I from Naples, Florida. We exchanged email addresses, but I wasn t really thinking too much of the whole thing and then he emailed. Short emails turned into daily tomes turned into gmail chats and then five hour long Skype sessions. Soon I was traveling to Italy for work and Italy just happens to be right next to Switzerland! :) Our first  date  (if you don t count all the Skype sessions) was in Lake Como. Not too long after our time in Italy, Yves quit his job and moved his whole life to Florida. Before I knew it, we were engaged. We couldn t have made this up   it was too extraordinary   reminding the both of us that God writes the best stories '
p3337
aS'That line,  God writes the best stories,  became a sort of theme for our wedding. We wanted to celebrate the fact that we had an international tale for which we were so grateful. :) We enlisted a lot of professional help, as you can see from the list above, but I was really excited to take part and carry certain elements/metaphors throughout the planning. The design on the envelope liner was a map with a thread and a heart linking Switzerland and Florida. Our tables were designated with names of towns of places we d been together and photos we d taken. Because almost of all our guests were traveling to Florida (Naples is not the original home of either of us), from all parts of the US, Canada, Switzerland, and even Australia, we really wanted to show our gratitude to them for sharing in our day. We made guest bags (with the help of dear local friends!) filled with homemade granola, muffins, Swiss chocolates (for Yves), oranges (for Florida) and Naples  magazines. We also love this quote from C.S. Lewis about a  secret thread  which unites certain people. We made sure that from the design of the invitation, to the program, to the guest book (a dictionary!), to the favors, there was a  secret thread  throughout.'
p3338
aS'Even though we live in a beach town, we didn t want to have a beach wedding. Even though we were getting married in the fall, I didn t want the normal fall colors. So, we had an indoor wedding, in a church and with a hotel reception, hoping that the design of both would be fresh and clean not at all  stuffy.  Our goal was to be simple and classic to have the kind of wedding that we ll still love in ten or twenty years, while also being very  us,  too, and where everyone present would feel loved and important. :) I think that s why a combination of professional vendors with some DIY details worked well for us.'
p3339
aS'In the weeks leading up to the wedding everyone couldn t have been more wonderful. I d been really sick, and had to let go of a lot of the details I d planned to take care of myself. So many amazing loved ones (including Yves!) stepped in to get everything done for us. We are so thankful to our family and friends for all their help in pulling it together. Although it sounds trite, it s true that we couldn t have done it without them. On top of that, each professional we worked with was so kind. They were encouraging, flexible, and just plain excellent. One of the band members even got out on the floor to teach us all a certain dance. From beginning to end, the whole event felt so intimate and familial it couldn t have been a more perfect day.\n'

This duo took the fab factor up about a thousand notches by hosting a f te where cozy and elegant styles mix and mingle - leaving us with a gallery by Angie Wilson Photography that will forever live in my brain as the perfect winter wedding.'
p3367
aS'From the Bride I am writing to share with you our amazing wedding experience at The Ritz Carlton Bachelor Gulch this past December. Marty and I were married Friday, December 6th at 4pm on the back terrace, outside. My husband and I were relocated to Toronto February of last year for his job. We had both been living in NYC for the past 8 years when the opportunity to experience expat life presented itself, the offer was too great to pass up so we packed up and moved North- to the great white North! Being from Florida and my husband hailing from NJ and living in Canada a destination wedding was an easy pick. My friends had been to a 100 beach wedddings and several our shared friends already did the NYC wedding. We wanted to offer our guests an experience- a chance to do something different. Marty is an avid skier (read: heli ski kind of skier) and I am doing my best to keep up! For several years we ve been heading out to Vail with a large NYC group to ski on the long holiday weekends. New Years Eve In Vail was becoming quite the tradition. We chose Bachelor Gulch because of its unique location and incredible presence when you pull up. We knew we wanted a winter wedding, giving us just a year to plan (which was necessary given the big move). With a venue in place by Jan 2013 we got to planning right away. I loved every minute of the process, it also kept me busy in my new town where we had made just a handful of friends (mostly co-workers!).'
p3368
aS'I would describe our wedding vision as warm, rustic and cozy and it was just that and more! One of the big reasons we also chose Bachelor Gulch was the opportunity to create an outdoor wedding. I know many of our guests thought we were crazy but it was so important to us that we got married outside. And even though it was 2 degrees on our wedding day with the help of the heat lamps. hand warmers and lovely hot chocolate/cider we pulled off the perfect outdoor ceremony right at the perfect time of day- dusk! Our vendors were the most amazing people to work with. Being a bride trying to plan from afar we couldn t have asked for better. It was easy and seamless and the staff at the hotel was so delightful. We received so many complements after our wedding on the staff and guests experiences. With 170 guests all traveling from a far it was really nice to hear how pleased everyone was.'
p3369
aS'I could go on and on about how much we loved our wedding week. We spent 8 days at the hotel and another night at The Ritz Denver before heading back to Canada. All in all we can t wait to return and we already have friends asking us to renew our vows .'

S'What s more romantic than Paris? A Paris themed wedding in Hawaii? Correct! Prepare yourselves for this one, readers. Jasmine Star Photography was there to capture this gorgeous ceremony in Oahu. While the couple is based there, we think the elegant details (matched to the perfectly pink venue), manages to nod at both influences flawlessly. See what we mean below.'
p3396
aS'From the bride '
p3397
aS'Theme: Jeremy proposed to me in Paris, where we first fell in love five years before. We briefly toyed with the ideas of having a destination wedding in Paris, but our ultimate goal was to throw an unforgettable party celebrating both our love for each other and for our closest friends and family, too. Since we couldn t afford to send all 200 guests to France for the weekend, this meant trying to bring a little Parisian romance and glamour to our island home.'
p3398
aS'Venue: My middle name, Hime, means  princess  in Japanese. So naturally, the Royal Hawaiian (nicknamed the  Pink Palace of the Pacific ) was the only place I could imagine for our celebration. We held the ceremony and cocktail hour on the lawn fronting Waikiki beach and moved indoors into the ballroom for the reception. It was perfection.'
p3399
aS'Colors: Our wedding colors were blush and gold. I picked blush pink because it is pretty and romantic and gold because it is glamorous and fun. Luckily, we found a stationer (Bella Figura) that was capable of doing shiny gold foil stamping with pink letterpress for our invitations. We picked a design that looked like confetti and champagne bubbles that really set the tone for our celebration.'
p3400
aS'Flowers: I wanted our flowers to be romantic and whimsical. We chose four types of vintage garden roses, pink hydrangeas, ivory and pink astilbe, ranunculus, and white veronica. Although most ballroom weddings nowadays seem to have big, tall centerpieces, I think they make it a little difficult for guests to converse. Our talented florist, Michelle Maeda of Flowergirls Hawaii, proposed a great solution: half the tables would have round, cakestand centerpieces and half would have mason jars. They turned out so beautiful, and they weren t so obtrusive that they got in the way of socializing!'
p3401
aS'DIY: We had lots of DIY elements. My mom handmade our lovely little ring pillow and helped me make our gold and pink escort cards. I handmade all the balloon streamers and the bar signs decorating the cocktail hour space, the table numbers (using gold glitter paper on pink stock in white Ikea frames), the display frame for the photo booth pictures, and the flower crowns for our five adorable nieces/flower girls. Jeremy and I dined on beautiful heirloom china from his Grandma Bessie. After planning and creating for two years, it was magical to see everything come together on our wedding day. Lauren of L4Love was instrumental in making our dreams become reality: Lauren and her team set up and executed everything flawlessly.'
p3402
aS'Bridesmaids: I had ten gorgeous bridesmaids and picking out their dresses was one of the most fun parts of the planning process. I wanted a mixture of hues and textures, so I worked with my bridesmaids so that everyone would look great together. Whenever I found a dress that I thought would be a good match, I would email all the girls (or pin it on a pinboard) and see if anyone wanted me to order it for them. It really worked out well: they got dresses that they loved and felt comfortable in, and they looked stunning both individually and as a group. Some people were incredulous that I had ten bridesmaids, but I was so happy to be able to spend that quiet time on the morning of the wedding surrounded by my best friends.'
p3403
aS'Advice for Future Brides:\n Relax, breathe, smile, sip on some champagne  enjoy your day! What really helps is to hire good vendors that you like and trust. On that note, pick a photographer who does beautiful work and whose company you enjoy. We picked Jasmine Star both because of her timeless, ethereal photographs and because she is just so easy and fun to be around: I knew we would be able to relax and be ourselves in front of the camera with her behind the lens. Our coordinator, Lauren was also amazing: organized, efficient, and dependable. And hire a videographer! My husband was skeptical, but he really is so grateful that we hired Fisheye. The day you have been planning for months or years really does go by so quickly, and you will want as many memories captured on film as possible.'
p3404
aS'Favorite Moment: I truly loved each moment of the day, but my favorite part had to be the ceremony. Listening to my sister Kelike sing  At Last  with the string quartet; seeing all our friends  and family members  faces radiating with love as my mom, brother, and I walked down the aisle; listening to my favorite person in the world saying the vows we wrote together  all of it just makes my heart fill with joy.\n'

aS'From the Bride We decided to celebrate our wedding at a wonderful and absolutely unique place   the palace and park ensemble of Gatchina (close to our hometown, St. Petersburg), a monument of Russian architecture of the XVIIIth century, located on a hill above the Silver Lake. The palace combines the spirit of a medieval castle and a country residence. It was impossible not to fall in love with it. We wanted to be outdoors, surrounded by the closest people, as Oleg and I wished this special day to hold an intimate atmosphere. In our climate, it was quite risky, but we were lucky with the weather. For the decoration of the wedding I chose a picturesque style (natural sensuality and randomness), vegetable still lifes on the tables and the bouquet in the OvOwi style. '

aS'The main mission for me as a decorator and florist   weren t to break the garden s&palace s image integrity and carefully enter the desired decor   close to their natural view as possible. And one more thing   to cope with the my nervous tension. Because it s not easy to combine the role of the bride and the decorator. However, I do not regret this precious experience. Impressions were amazing and absolutely unforgettable. It was the best day of my life!\n'
