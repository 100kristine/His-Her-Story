S'Love knows no borders and this couple proves it by crossing the country to wed in their native Golden State. From East to West, with romance front and center, Lovely Little Details coordinated a day filled with gorgeous blooms by Cherries and custom cocktails for sipping. Kate Harrison was behind the lens to capture every blissful moment in a gallery that could make time stand still. '

aS'From The Bride  Andrew and I met our freshman year at the University of Arizona and as they say, the rest is history. The military brought us to the East Coast but we knew we wanted to be married in our home state of California and near my hometown in the Bay Area. When we picked the Legion of Honor as our wedding location, we were warned that August is the foggiest month of the year, earning the nickname of  Fogust . Not only is the Legion of Honor an architectural masterpiece, the property has stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the perfect backdrop to a wedding ceremony. Fogust lived up to its name and there was no bridge to be seen during our wedding ceremony but the photos are breathtaking even without the iconic bridge.'
p118
aS'Planning our wedding from Virginia, Andrew and I put together a dream team to make our big day everything we had imagined. We never went in with a true theme, except we knew we wanted it to be classic and to incorporate charcoal gray and purple as those are Andrew and I s favorite colors. Two other necessities for our wedding was a custom cocktail and awesome 80s music to dance to.'
p119
aS'Andrew picked out a charcoal gray suit that looked great on all the groomsmen. The boys all wore a purple madras tie to match Andrew s bow tie. The charcoal gray and purple looked great together! Following the theme, the bridesmaids wore Jenny Yoo Aidan charcoal dresses. All five bridesmaids picked a different way to wear the dress and had amazing pink and purple bouquets in their hands. Katherine of Cherries made my dream floral arrangements a reality. We met two times while I was in town and showed her my dress, shoes, swatches of the bridesmaid s dresses and she went to work with my pink and purple flower request. She has great vision, and we were blown away by her abilities to pull everything together.'
p120
aS'Andrew contacted Julibox, about coming up with a signature cocktail for our wedding. They came up with a  Summer in Paris  cocktail with St Germaine, that accompanied an Old Fashioned. Melon s Catering was gracious enough to let us bring the items needed to make the signature cocktail!'
p121
aS'We are so happy we had Kate Harrison there to capture our day in all its gorgeousness, the flowers were stunning against the foggy backdrop and inside the caf  which transformed into an elegant spot for dinner and dancing. Jacin Fitzgerald of lovely little details was an amazing coordinator and stylist. Every couple needs to have her on their wedding team. She has amazing ideas and made everything come together as if the Legion of Honor does weddings all the time after the museum closes! We could not have been happier with the wedding planning process and the actual wedding itself. She made it a breeze, even if we were planning it from 3,000 miles away.\n'

S'There aren t enough adjectives to fully describe a KT Merry wedding. Her camera can turn even the ordinary into art, so when you put her in front of an absurdly gorgeous Sonoma affair (despite a downpour of rain just minutes before the ceremony!) and she won t disappoint.

aS'From The Bride Andrew and I finally met in early 2009, after more than a year of hearing each other s names. I would come home from grad school and one of my best friends would tell me about this  Dobies  guy who plays professional baseball with her boyfriend. Apparently Andrew had also been hearing my name from my best friend s now-husband. After graduating from the University of Michigan, I moved back to Seattle and in with my best friend. Andrew must have heard my name one last time, since out of the blue he contacted me and slowly we developed a really great social media, then phone relationship. We had been dying to meet and a couple months later while I was in Michigan visiting my sister and he was playing baseball in Akron, Ohio, I did what anyone would do and drove 2.5 hours south to the middle of nowhere (at least that I had ever been), to meet this Dobies guy for our first date. When my nerves finally wore off, we found this magical little park in the middle of nowhere and spent hours matching each other s faces and expressions to the voices we were used to only hearing. It was a pretty perfect day.'
p178
aS'Since that day, we knew we had to be together no matter what else happened, or despite that little fact that I lived and worked in Seattle and he played baseball all over the country. So we did what love makes you do, and we traveled madly across the country to be together whenever and wherever we could, with me racking up frequent flyer miles flying, and Andrew racking up miles every off-season driving to Seattle to live with me. As a result of his career in professional baseball, Andrew and I have always had moving and changing variables in our relationship; ones that literally and figuratively moved him and us around, and at times brought chaos and uncertainty to both of us. But we always found ways to adapt and keep our love and commitment to one another strong. All those years of adapting and adjusting, all the uncertainty and separation only made us stronger as individuals and as a couple. One of the most important lessons we ve learned is that staying each other s teammate and constant throughout and despite all those changing variables is what has made our love so strong and enduring.'
p179
aS'Andrew proposed on a Florida beach at sunset the day after Christmas in 2012, he d been playing Winter baseball in Mexico for the past two months, but he apparently pulled it off with the help of our friend (and ring designer extraordinaire) back in Seattle. So sneaky! Since then, we ve had many transitions; we ve moved together cross-country to NYC and we were married in Sonoma in April 2014.'
p180
aS'Our wedding day was absolute perfection. Despite it raining all morning and even pouring (and hailing, I was told!), just ten minutes before the ceremony, the skies opened up and it stopped raining. Since visiting Trentadue Winery that weekend exactly one year before, Andrew and I had envisioned being married outside with the rolling hills and vineyards as our backdrop. So when the rain stopped Andrew insisted that everything be moved to the lawn, it was go-time. The Groom, his dad, his Groomsmen, all took off their jackets and hauled everything outside. If there is one thing about Andrew, he will move mountains to make me happy, that s just him (even if it meant getting his tux dirty right before we even said  I do ). Our ceremony was perfect, even better than we had envisioned it. One of our guests told us later it was like someone came and vacuumed the lawn, it was completely dry. Not even ten minutes after the ceremony, it started to sprinkle, so we got extra good luck that day and even a rainbow out of it! I have so many favorite moments from that day, but one of my most favorites was when Andrew and I were walking out into the vineyards at dusk with our photographers and KT Merry spotted a wild bunny in the vineyards, it was a symbol that always lets me know that my parents who are in Heaven are with me, and they were right there with us that day.'
p181
aS'We wanted every guest at our wedding to feel comfortable and have a good time, to feel like they had just been invited to a really great dinner party with amazing food and wine, where could also dance and laugh and even a sit outside by a fire pit with a cigar and glass of port wine. I feel like we accomplished that! We worked with the best professionals in the business and they all made our Big Day feel absolutely seamless. It was certainly our most special and favorite days of our lives so far, and one that we will treasure in our hearts forever.\n'

S'Speaking as a bride-to-be, this lovely shoot is exactly what my wedding dreams are made of. Kurt Boomer captured the innocence of a quite morning echoed by the Gossamer gown and perfectly pink lips. Meanwhile, the anticipation of her complexion draped in a delicate veil perfectly flatters Heirloom Design House blushing blooms. You will want to light a candle in honor of one of the most beautiful galleries ever. '
p211
aS'From Kurt Boomer The idea behind this inspirations shoot was the feeling of the morning of Theresa s wedding. Capturing the anticipation and nervousness a couple goes through when the start of their life together is imminent. Rehearsing the day in her mind, repeating the vows written down and reading the love letter left the night before.'
p212
aS'Every bride has been a unique experience in photographing before the ceremony. The times I enjoy the most are the reflection on the relationship that both couples seem to go through. The small bit of quiet in the sometimes hectic nature of the wedding day. I hoped to capture this time of the day in these images.\n'

S'Los Angeles weddings continually catch my eye. They always seem to have a certain flair; they re elegant yet comfortable, sophisticated but fun. And this wedding just reinforces all those beliefs and more. The amazing style of this couple is evident throughout the whole chic celebration, and Mi Belle Photography captured it all, ready to add some panache to your day right here.'
p261
aS'From The Bride Leo and I met on a train 6 years ago when we were both living in New York City. We moved to Los Angeles 3 years ago for Leo to attend business school at UCLA and fell in love with the sunny weather, gorgeous beaches and SoCal lifestyle. We quickly realized that Los Angeles was the place we saw ourselves living long-term and Leo popped the question on the beach in Santa Monica. We decided we wanted to have our wedding in LA to share with our family and friends the place we now considered home.'
p262
aS'When starting to discuss the type of wedding we wanted, we knew we wanted it to be intimate, classic yet unique, and a true representation of our relationship and life together. We also knew we wanted delicious, healthy, California-inspired food that our guests would love and a super fun (non-cheesy) DJ.'
p263
aS'We were smitten with Carondelet House the moment we stepped inside, and loved the combination of both a downtown and rustic feel that the gorgeous space offered. The historic building is full of warm touches like a fireplace, exposed brick walls, and long communal style tables for dinner. Our wedding was fairly small at 110 people, so being in a smaller space felt so intimate and special. One of the best things about Carondelet House was their in-house catering company, Tres LA. The food is locally sourced and seasonally inspired and was beyond delicious! Sitting down to the communal tables with friends and family to share a such a great meal together was truly special. The biggest compliment we received from guests was that our wedding felt so personal and like a true celebration of our marriage and life together!'
p264
aS'One of the most memorable parts of the day was a morning yoga class I organized for my bridal party, mom and mother-in-law. I am a dedicated yogi and thought a class on the morning of the wedding would be a fun, positive and inspiring way to start the day! Plus, I wanted to treat my bridal party and lovely mom and mother-in-law to something special to thank them all for being part of the big day. One of my favorite yoga teachers, Laura Conley of YogaWorks, led an amazing class and had everyone laughing, relaxed, and filled with love!'
p265
aS'I think the most special part of the day was our ceremony. We had a friend officiate and had the shortest ceremony in wedding history (10 minutes!), but it was the most special, personal, best 10 minutes of our lives. From the funny and emotional dinner toasts to the dance party that ensued (complete with plenty of Leo s favorite type of music genre   rap), we could not have asked for a more perfect day filled with love, family and friends.\n'

aS'From The Bride Andy surprised me with a beach bonfire and a gorgeous emerald cut diamond while visiting the charming Carmel one weekend last November. We chose Pebble Beach almost immediately after getting engaged   it s hard not to fall in love with a location as beautiful as Pebble Beach and it s surroundings! We have done a lot of travel together over the years so we decided sharing a destination dear to us would be the best reflection of what we had hoped for our wedding day.'
p313
aS'We wanted our wedding to be timeless with romantic details and classic, casual style. The ceremony was held on the legendary 18th Lawn with a harpist playing and white rose petals scattered down the aisle overlooking the water   a pretty iconic location to say  I do . The reception setting tied in perfectly to its surroundings and was a picture-perfect image of it s own. It was held at The Lodge at Pebble Beach, a stunning space with floor to ceiling windows, and our very favorite Carmel Beach as the backdrop. The tables were set with white and blush linens, gold chiavari chairs, and soft, loose florals which helped lend the California-casual vibe to the day.'
p314
aS'It was important to us that our guests, all of which had flown in from all over the world, to love the area as much as we do and have an amazing time. We served our favorite regional wines, a five course dinner, and brought in only the best DJ to keep our guests on their feet the entire night. We had a ball! Andy and I are forever grateful for the memories of our wedding day and our closest friends and family who were there with us. Daryl Griffith and the entire Pebble Beach team pulled together our vision brilliantly and were a complete joy to work with during the short 7 months we had to plan our wedding. It was the perfect celebration of our union and it s warmed our hearts to hear our guests compliment how amazing the day was for them, too. It will be a cherished destination to return to for years to come!'

aS'From Bright Blue Events Josh, a director, and Narelle, a top high fashion model s wedding could compare to almost a mini coachella! They had a amazing wooded paradise at Topagna s, The 1909 to bring in some of the most fun and unique musicians to be found half of which were good friends chiming in for their incredably cozy romantic ceremony on top of a melange of carpets and pillows under an ancient oak tree.'
p348
aS'The ambiance was groovy, hip, relaxed and filled with so much brilliant music. The amazing quartet Trash Honey went acoustic, creating a super hip hominess to the entire event. Guest moved upstairs on the property to dance to the high energy Ukelele Group, Ukes of Hazzard for the remainder of the evening but not first sending the couple upstairs with a sparkler lit first dance around the fire in an open meadow surrounded by all of their friends. Brilliant florals were put together by Hollyflora simple, eclectic and rustic. And the whole day was captured perfectly by Docuvitae Photography.'

S'I ve got a serious crush on this wedding, and admittedly, this stylish couple. Aren t they snazzy? The Bride in her Inbal Dror dress, fancied up by Artistry By Danika and the red bow-tied Groom looking dapper in a white jacket. Oh, and cruising around in a vintage Porsche, too. See? I told you they were awesome. And their wedding is just as fun as they are. Tyler Branch snapped it all up right here.'
p419
aS'From the beautiful Bride The beautiful home where we chose to have our wedding is named Casa Contenta, and has been in my husband s family since the 1940 s. Many a great parties took place here, where my grandparents-in-law would host the likes of Clark Gable and The Reagan s. On the night of our wedding, a distant relative informed us that Cary Grant was actually wed there as well! As we planned our wedding together, it became our mission to bring these old parties to life for our friends and family: a big bash on the very first day of Summer!'
p420
aS'I m originally from South Carolina and my husband grew up in London. As if these three converging settings weren t enough, let me add that my mother-in-law is from Oaxaca, Mexico! It was very important for us to incorporate our unique, respective backgrounds into one special day. The result was a collection of incredible local vendors, and many DIY elements that were unique to us.'
p421
aS'My aunt, who owns a slip cover shop in Charleston, SC created custom green & white striped covers for the wrought iron cabana beds and chairs   while another aunt lent the most beautiful calligraphy to our place cards and table numbers. My father and brother-in-law spent countless hours creating heart pine signs and an elegant card box, reclaimed from an old school house from the 1800 s in South Carolina. My mother lent me my great grandmother s handkerchief for me to take down the aisle, and perhaps most impressively of all   my dear friend, Emma (who introduced my husband and I!) created every last flower arrangement (including the giant bouquets of peonies) for us as a gift.'
p422
aS'We started setting the vibe for our party long before June 21st rolled around   with the help of our stationer, Lilly & Louise. She incorporated old newspaper clippings from some of the fabulous parties that were thrown at the Casa Contenta! On the day of our wedding, I surprised my husband with a vintage Porsche   what ultimately ended up being one of the most popular aspects of our wedding (hello photo opp)! Guests mingled in different areas of the estate among vintage copper tables and in a special room of the house called  The Copper Room  that took everyone back to another place and time.'
p423
aS'For as much as we debated throughout the planning process, the one things we completely agreed on was the food! We were so fortunate to have Chef Alejandro Ruiz (one of Latin America s 50 Best Chefs) fly up from Oaxaca to treat our guests to some of the local specialties he creates at his restaurant, Casa Oaxaca. Guests nibbled on garnachas and ceviche before sitting down to a three course meal followed by red velvet cake from Sweet & Saucy and cooling down from the dance floor with organic ice cream selections from Sweet Lucies.'
p424
aS'Seeing all of our hard work and preparation come together was one of the great joys of my life. My advice for any bride is to do your research. Take time in selecting your vendors. If you re like me, you could spend up to a year with these great folks, developing a relationship with many. Don t be afraid to get  Pin Happy , but know WHEN to ultimately put down the Pinterest Button (great advice from my friend / floral stylist), about a week out from the wedding)!\n'

S'When I lived in California, I had the pleasure of visiting the ever-so-lovely Strawberry Farms and remembered thinking,  this would be such a perfect place for a wedding . So I just love that I get to see just such a perfect day unfold through this couples  gorgeous wedding captured by Palos Photography. From start to finish, it defines charming and you can see what I mean right here.'
p481
aS'When we found Strawberry Farms we instantaneously fell in love. The white long picket fences, the blossoming flowers that align the courtyard, the fantastic food (and wine!) selections, and the AMAZING barn were just some of the aspects we loved about this venue. Also, since a large portion of our guests were flying in from out of town, it was really important to us to have our ceremony and reception at the same venue.'
p482
aS'From there, we started diving into the details of our  theme  of the wedding with our wedding planner Lynsay from Lux Events. Can I first say how amazing she is? Hands down, one of the most creative, inspiring, professional, and thoughtful people I have ever met. She really took the time to get to know us as a couple, and just took the extra time to ensure all the details were perfect. Considering we are so passionate about our careers, Lynsay gave us the idea to give our wedding a bit of a medical twist. Luckily, my maid of honor is a graphic designer and was able to whip up some amazing sign-in cards with each of them saying please write a  Prescription for a Happy Marriage  for the bride and groom. Also, for party favors we bought mini-brown glass bottles (to resemble a pill bottle), stuffed them with jelly beans, and had stickers made that said  There is no remedy to love but to love more.  All the guest loved them and were able to bring them home for treats the next day!'
p483
aS'One last important detail that was really important to us  MUSIC! Ladies and gentleman planning a wedding .. You will NEVER go wrong with live music. After months of researching we came across a community college that specializes in art and music. We were so impressed with them and hired them right away! Needless to say, there were about 35 college students singing, playing instruments, and dancing at our wedding  highlight of our night!! They made our night a BLAST!'
p484
aS'The day of the wedding of course a few things went wrong. The groomsmen corsages would not stay on their suits (so we instead used the flowers to decorate the gift table), but it s all about having a great attitude and knowing that all these little things do not matter. The day of the wedding I was as relaxed as could be. I was just ready to have FUN and get married to the man of my dreams.'
p485
aS'To all the brides out there here is my best advice: get a videographer. Hands down, one of the best decisions we made that day. Second, look up when you are walking down the aisle. I think I was nervous because there are so many pictures of me looking down! Lastly, the more fun you have on your wedding day the better the party is! Your guests will sense that you are having fun and they will want to join in with you  trust me!'
p486
aS'Our wedding day was perfect for us, and we wish we would re-do this day over and over and over again! Thank you to all of our vendors for putting on such a great event for our friends and families  it was the BEST day!!!\n'

S'There s no denying this affair is dotted with pin-worthy details. But what I love most is the infusion of unexpected treasures that put smiles on guests faces and love in their hearts. My favorite? Old school CD favors with the Bride & Groom s most-loved songs. So 90 s and sooo fun. And their approach to DIY, or rather, DIWF (do it with friends) is the best idea ever. WINK! coordinated the entire day to perfection and our friends at onelove photography made sure no moment went un-captured.'
p520
aS'From the beautiful Bride Creating a wedding celebration that was fun and personal was our guiding principle throughout the planning process. It s pretty easy to get caught up in what everyone is doing on Pinterest and the like, but we frequently tried to remind ourselves that what we really wanted was for our guests to have a great time at a celebration that paid homage to the people, places, and life experiences that got us where are today.'
p521
aS'First and foremost was the music. We re pretty big music people, probably a result of the families we come from. There s always something playing in our household   and usually more than one genre depending on which room you re in. Naturally our DJ choice was critical and we loved ours. We worked with them to curate the majority of the night s soundtrack including the 15 minute reprieve of traditional Cambodian dance music that got all the aunties and uncles out on the dance floor.'
p522
aS'Then as parting gifts, we gave all of our guests CDs (old school right?) with some of our favorite songs. In the days following the wedding it was so awesome to receive messages from friends saying how much they loved this track or that track. See, who says CDs are obsolete?'
p523
aS'Instead of a traditional wedding sign-in book that would probably get shelved away, we thought we d change it up a little bit and have guests sign a poster frame we could mount on our wall. Vi is an optometrist so we created a Snellen eye chart that read,  And they lived happily ever after.  Now whenever we re walking down the hallway we can glance through great words of advice from friends including,  Happy wife, happy life.  :)'
p524
aS'Last but not least was our tribute to the city that really transformed our relationship from boyfriend-girlfirend status to marriage material. Over the course of three years, Philadelphia became our second home. There, in our little one bedroom apartment on Ben Franklin Parkway, we squabbled over dishwashing duty and cooked our first grownup meals. In honor of Philly and the wonderful friends we made there who were flying cross country to celebrate with us, we had a cheesesteak station during happy hour, complete with an instructional  How To Order  sign a la Pat s King of Steaks. We also topped off our cake with a mini version of Robert Indiana s LOVE sculpture, a replica of which stands in the center of Philly s Love Park, located only minutes from our old apartment.'
p525
aS'All of the decorations were DIWF (DO IT WITH FRIENDS). I had the best bridesmaids a girl could have ever hoped for, truly. They flew into town from all over and showed up at my doorstep with glue, scissors, double-sided tape, etc. in hand and got to work. There were separate stations set up all over my house and I floated through each of them, never ceasing to be amazed at their artistic eye and craftsmanship. These ladies are tax accountants, doctors, marketing and business consultants by day, and Martha Stewart by night! Everything actually turned out even more amazing than I had envisioned. That night doing crafts and drinking boba with my girlfriends was definitely one of my favorite memories from our wedding weekend.\n'

S'Fall-lovers unite and feast your eyes on this slice of autumn pretty from Betsi Ewing Studio and Pretty Lil Details. It s the marrying of dusty plum, pomegranate red, sweet fall peach and earthy olive green. The table is set with gold sprinkled cake pops, cinnamon sugar-rimmed spiked ciders in mini milk bottles, goblets and vessels galore from Pretty Vintage Table, overflowing blooms from Knot Just Flowers and one seriously gorgeous cake from Frost It Cupcakery. There s even more in the gallery!'
p557
aS'From Pretty Lil Details Me and my amazing team of gals wanted to colab on a styled shoot for Fall. For this particular event I chose a  Fall in Love  themed wedding. I wanted to capture the regal side of Fall   a season not just filled with whimsy, but also grace. My vision was to highlight the bounty of fall through both the food and d cor. I mixed amber tones with a blush pink and added some rose gold for that romantic flare.'
p558
aS'I stopped by Pretty Vintage Rentals showroom in Westlake Village and picked out some timeless charming pieces. I fell in love with the stunning amber and pink pressed glass goblets, amber pedestal bowls for florals, beautiful gold mirror trays and florentine trays, as well as some statement furniture for desserts, drinks and a vintage farmhouse table to complete my vision of creating a romantic ambiance.'
p559
aS'Next, I thought of a signature cocktail that ties in with my theme. I decided to make a  spiked apple cider , which highlighted an apple cider mix, champagne, and vodka. I used milk jugs and a beverage dispenser to create a drink station, I then tied cinnamon sticks using twine to each mini vintage milk jug for a special touch. Dinner was a hearty family style with heavy hors d oeuvres to start.'
p560
aS'For dessert, the amazing Frost It Cupcakery created a delectable naked vanilla cake with crystallized ginger layered with pomegranate buttercream. To incorporate the fall theme, the cake was embellished with pretty lil gold acorns.'
p561
aS'For florals, the uber talented Sharon Lopez from Knot Just Flowers created gorgeous arrangements with loose fall greens, amber flowers with a lot of texture in crystal glass vases. She wanted to incorporate dried flowers into the arrangements and bouquets to reflect the harvest aspect of fall.'
p562
aS'On the table, I chose a pretty rose table runner with white organic napkins. Ceramic plates sat upon antique books used as chargers. I also brought in a variety of staging props such as decorative pumpkins in orange and gold, tons of candles, apples, pumpkins, pomegranates and sprigs of fall leaves and acorns.\n'

This wedding does just that and more, from the bilingual ceremony to the Trolley Refreshment Hour (best. idea. ever). Nicole Wasko snapped the pretty and I ll be happily poring over every last moment. Join me, won t you?'
p599
aS'From The Bride  Our wedding day was also our 11th anniversary so it was quite a meaningful day for Donald and I, along with our families, many of whom came all the way from Mexico! We wanted the day to be a celebration of our togetherness and represent what we love, so it could only be in Santa Barbara, our beloved getaway destination from life in L.A. We had our ceremony on the Historic Courthouse Lawn because it s a place we often visit for its beauty, and chose the Greenhouse at Stella Mare s for our reception, for its romantic location across from the Andree Clark Bird Refuge.'
p600
aS'As a graphic designer, printed materials and customization is hugely important to me, so I spent much of my time designing wedding details that would incorporate our love story and excitement for the day. I designed the invitations using photographs that I took on our weekend trips to the city, as well as hand-painting the map for our city-guide. Since the wedding was a bilingual affair, that meant that I designed everything in both English and Spanish, which ended up being a beautiful way to blend our two families together. The ceremony programs told our story, of how Donald moved from Wisconsin when he was 18 to live with me in California over 9 years ago. It was another way for us to honor our partnership, which is what made the day so special!'
p601
aS'One of my favorite aspects of the day was the Trolley Refreshment Hour. We decided to forego a traditional cocktail hour and instead take a trip through the city, so that our loved ones could sightsee and unwind. We had the trolley stop at the Santa Barbara Mission for it s romantic views and garden and then made our way towards the beach. For the refreshments, I printed custom designs onto muslin bags and packed them with our favorite lemonade blends, snacks, and our own homemade nut mix (yes, I even designed the label with obligatory California palm trees!). It was a blissful time, as we drove by the beach as newlyweds and listened to Phoenix, Al Green and vintage Julio Iglesias with our families in tow.'
p602
aS'The reception mixed many of my favorite things together; watercolor motifs, vintage style, paper decorations, organic flower arrangements and even a cat figurine for the dessert table. We never made specific favors, but we had wildflower seeds that went along with the escort cards and cookies and milk to take home at the end of the night. We wanted things to feel casual and relaxed, just as we normally are. We also set up a polaroid photo area for guests and I made typographic photo props with English & Spanish phrases. Seeing these photos at the end of the night was definitely a highlight! My absolute favorite moment of the day was during our first dance, which was to Roy Orbison s,  In Dreams  and it was the only time that I thought that the  ugly cry  might come out! Luckily Donald said all the right things to make me laugh and enjoy the moment.'
p603
aS'All in all, it was a decidedly DIY affair since it was important for us to personalize the day: from writing our own ceremony, to designing the style of the his & her cakes (Mexican chocolate for mine, banana coconut for his), to arranging the flowers with family and even creating the trolley route   our love and effort was everywhere.\n'

S'I ve been told that this wedding took place in California but if I had to guess, I would have sworn the magic occurred in some far-away secret forest. The celebration radiates pure joy, filled to the brim with romantic details, and Sposto Photography was there to make sure nothing was missed. Soak up this beautiful happily ever after from start to finish right here.'
p655
aS'From Sposto Photography  Jenny and Jeff chose a soft pastel pallet for their wedding. Perfect for spring! Nestled in the back woods of Temecula, CA the 350-acre property of Temecula Creek Inn offered some incredible locations for photos. The girls all got ready in an adorable cottage on site sipping champagne, telling secrets, and gussying up! The boys got ready nearby and enjoyed drinks out of their custom whiskey decanter grooms gifts. After the intimate first look under the canopy of an old oak tree, the bridal party all moved up the road to the secluded wedding site featuring a gorgeous stone cottage built in the 1800 s. Live piano music played as guests arrived and found their seats amongst the beautiful tree canopy backdrop. It truly felt like walking through a forest fairy tale. Everyone laughed and cried as the groom shared his memorized vows while looking into the eyes of his beloved. Everyone cheered when the bride and groom shared their first kiss. As everyone moved towards the reception area just over a tiny bridge, they found their seats by looking at the hand lettered window panes creatively decorated in floral draping. As the sun went down the candlelight lit up the party that was about to begin. The photo booth was packed all night as dinner was served in the stone house. The cake was cut on it s small porch while people watched from the dance floor. The party rocked all night with Jenny and Jeff s choice of a live funk band who tore it up! '

S'As a born and raised Northeaster, California weddings hold the allure of never-ending sunshine and beauty, and this Golden State affair once again proves me right. Under the direction of Savoir Flair Weddings and Gilly Flowers, this rustic meets classic affair was brought to life. Escape back to summer bliss with all the gorgeous photos by Heather Kincaid found here.'
p698
aS'From Heather Kincaid  Though Bridgette is from Malibu, she and Tyler currently live in Connecticut, so their wedding at the gorgeous Saddlerock Ranch in Malibu was a destination event. Set amongst the vineyards of the ranch, this wedding was the quintessential California wedding- a gorgeous couple, rustic details with a sophisticated finish, a blush Monique Lhullier gown  it all screamed relaxed-yet-elegant California vibes.'
p699
aS'From the Bride  After 7 years together and 10 years as friends, our wedding was a long time coming. We decided to get married in my hometown of Malibu, which was special to us since we are both originally from Southern California, but neither of us has lived there in a decade. We knew we wanted to get married outside, and after we saw Saddlerock Ranch, we never visited another venue.'
p700
aS'Our coordinator, Ryan Larson, was instrumental in helping us design the warm, relaxed, and fun wedding we had envisioned. This was no small task, since we live on the East Coast and planned most of our wedding from out of state. From flowers to music and everything in between, Ryan s vendor recommendations were invaluable to us. In the end, our wedding day was more perfect than we could have imagined, surrounded by our closest family and friends in a truly beautiful setting.\n'

S'Now that your Halloween sugar high is in full effect, we decided to round out this Friday with one of the prettiest white-on-white weddings we ve ever come across. It s what happens when My Bride Story takes the style reigns for a day anchored in classic design + glam winter whites, and the captures from Erin Hearts Court? Well, they re the kind of photos that ll remain timeless forever.'
p745
aS'From The Bride Jon and I met in Santa Monica on Carmageddon weekend when the 405 was closed and everyone stayed put and hung out in their neighborhoods. We met at a pizza parlor and spent the next year and a half living and enjoying life at the beach. Jon proposed on a sunny afternoon while we were walking on the beach. He had the whole thing planned out perfectly and we stayed the night at Casa del Mar, which is just down the street from our apartment. I knew right away that we should also get married there and he agreed. Step one of wedding planning was done.'
p746
aS'The only thing I knew beyond the location was that I wanted a white wedding with no bridal party. We have five families between the two of us and we wanted each one of our family members to be a part of the wedding. We chose one of my brothers to be the wedding officiant and everyone else would walk down the aisle wearing whatever they chose.'
p747
aS'While searching wedding websites for ideas I saw a wedding that I thought was beautiful. I contacted the planner, Esther Kim, we met and I knew she was perfect. The rest of the planning was fun and easy. Esther and I worked so well together and the finished product was better than anything I could have ever dreamed of.'
p748
aS'Jon and I designed a wedding ceremony that matched our personalities and showed the tremendous amount of love we have for one another. The room for the ceremony was lit with candles and filled with white flowers. It was truly breathtaking and our favorite part of the day. It really was the best day of our lives, getting to celebrate with all our friends and family from near and far. We can t thank our families enough for all their love and support. We look forward to working with Esther to help us celebrate future milestones.\n'

S'The lovely Stephanie and I were chatting, and we ve come to the conclusion (especially after seeing this gem prettied up by TOAST Santa Barbara!) that we absolutely must come up with an excuse to visit Sunstone Winery. It s impeccably gorgeous. And it just so happened to be the change of course destination this beautiful couple chose after their first venue was sadly flooded. Captured by Khanh Hogland and Made U Look, this day is filled to the brim, darlings. Filled with pretty.'
p789
aS'From the Groom (yes, the Groom!) After a perfect proposal on the beaches of Mexico, we thought we had found our wedding site in Lyons, Colorado. Weeks later, a historic flood washed through the area and completely demolished our wedding venue. We took this as a sign and decided to completely change our idea of our perfect wedding from a large wedding to an intimate, destination wedding at Sunstone Vineyards and Winery in Santa Ynez, California.'
p790
aS'Emily s first walk down the aisle was on the airplane from Denver to LAX, where she walked down the airplane aisle from row 5 to 24 with a pile of brightly colored trash as her bouquet, accompanied by family singing  here comes the bride.  Our 8 total wedding guests shared laughter (the kind that makes your stomach hurt) that would set the tone for the rest of the weekend.'
p791
aS'We arrived to Sunstone Villa and were immediately struck by the breathtaking views of the Santa Ynez mountains and the romantic ambiance. The Villa is built from imported limestone from a small village in France, and wood beams and roof tiles reclaimed from a 19th century lavender factory, once owned by Queen Victoria. The Tuscan-inspired Villa boasts 8,500 square feet of luxury living space on the winery s 55 acre estate. After settling into our new wedding getaway, we had a tasting at the winery and enjoyed the final product of the perfectly manicured vineyards surrounding the Villa.'
p792
aS'On our wedding day, we awoke to the beautiful misty landscape of the Santa Ynez valley and hummingbirds peering through the window. For breakfast, Emily s Mom made her famous Dutch pancakes. Our Event Planner Kim from  Toast Santa Barbara , began setting up the ceremony and floral designs. We saw them setting up our Chuppah with Birchwood entangled in elegant peony and rose bouquets settled under a massive tree. The vintage lace Chuppah cover was made from Ben s Grandma s beautiful wedding veil, the same Chuppah cover Ben s sister and brother-in-law were married under one month earlier. We knew the beginnings of the most beautiful wedding site we had ever seen was in full swing. The sun started to set as Emily walked down the aisle from the Villa to the Chuppah to the music of Chris Fossek playing acoustic guitar. Emily was very close with her  nana,  who did not live to see her get married, but she was certainly there in spirit. We were reminded of this by Emily s gorgeous wedding bouquet, which had a small picture of Emily s nana pinned to it. We re sure her nana was smiling with Emily when she walked down the aisle. Suffice it to say this was a much different scene than the airplane aisle walk! Our Ketubah, created by  Ink with Intent,  encompassed a blend between the outdoors of Colorado and Oregon. Chelsea, Ben s sister, officiated our wedding with an amazing ceremony script and unique ring ceremony where each family member individually held our wedding rings and mentioned one thing they hoped for in our marriage.'
p793
aS'We re very grateful for making the choice to have an intimate ceremony and we wouldn t have it any other way. It was a perfect day and we ll remember it forever as we do our best to live by the words of our vows as we share the rest of our days together.\n'

S'One consensus I hear while planning my own nuptials is that the day goes by in a blur. So why not take note from this darling couple and their after wedding portraits - I mean, any excuse to slip on that Monique Lhuillier and a flower crown by Tango & Fox Trot again? Yes, please! Through the haze Coco Tran captured so many sweet moments they have me wishing for a post wedding session myself.'
p819
aS'From Coco Tran Kevin and Nancy wed in June in San Diego, working with Nancy in the past ( Her engagement session) she wanted to book a after session with me for a Bride and Groom portrait session. She wore her stunning Monique Lhullier wedding dress. The flowy dress on a foggy Marin afternoon alongside with Flowers by Tango and Foxtrot made this session truly fine art and one of a kind.'
p820
aS'I love photographing my couples after their wedding. The wedding day seems to go by with a blink of an eye, and sometimes there isn t enough time in the wedding day to include romantic bride and groom portraits. It s a great opportunity to relive your wedding day and it gives me more time to creatively photograph my couples! It s also nice that we get to pick any venue/location the couple would like. Sometimes, I m booked for my couples wedding dates, so this is a great way for us to work together to create stunning wedding images without having to change your wedding date .'
p821
aS'Nancy & Kevin brought some wedding day props to dress up their after session. The wooden sign, Nancy s flower girl was holding that down the aisle before Kevin saw Nancy. The DIY letter box made by Nancy with their wedding colors. All little details that were a special part of Nancy and Kevin s big day.\n'

S'This sweetly smiling Bride and her handsome Groom have stolen my heart for the day. Their story, their strength and their undeniably powerful love. Just two short months before their big day, her dear father lost his battle with cancer yet the twinkling chandeliers that were hung above the backyard (at her parent s home) were a special reminder of Dad. Furthermore, A Savvy Event prettied up the entire day with beautiful details galore and Allyson Wiley snapped every bit of gorgeous that this gallery holds.'
p860
aS'From the beautiful Bride Chris and I met in August of 2009. I had recently been hired as a tasting room associate at a winery in Livermore and Chris walked in and I immediately asked as he walked by   Who s that guy  with a big grin on my face. As life sometimes flows  we both went our separate ways in relationships and I moved on from my job at the winery but we always stayed in touch, wishing each other happy birthday, and sending random texts here and there. Chris had always held a special place with me and he crept into my thoughts more than I would like to admit during that time apart.'
p861
aS'Then in 2012 via text, of course, we both figured out that we were available. And luckily for a UPS delivery gone wrong  after a roundabout conversation  I asked Chris to meet me for a drink, Yes I asked Chris out. We met at our friends beer bar Tap25, neither one of us sure of whether or not it was a date, but after a beer or two it became clear that we were going to be more than just friends. We ended up going to dinner, then he took me back to the winery and let me sample his wine. It was an amazing first date!'
p862
aS'As as they say the rest is history  I don t think we have been apart more than a few days after that first date, and by the time our wedding came around we had been together almost two years and I still fall in love with him a little more each and every day. He asked me to marry him on June 14th of 2013 at the beach in Incline Village in Tahoe and made me the happiest girl in the world. I have found my soul mate and was so excited to put a ring on his finger and call him mine for life. Although I think he pretty much had me at that first smile back in 2009.'
p863
aS'Our wedding was everything we could have ever imagined. We had it at my parents home in Sonoma, Ca. After visiting many of the beautiful venues in the area we just felt like home was where it was supposed to be. In April of 2014, just 2 months before our wedding my father passed away from a short but courageous battle with cancer. Having our wedding in his backyard just made it feel so right and that he was there the entire time. Both my mom and dad were very involved in helping to plan this beautiful day. We couldn t have done it without them.'
p864
aS'Our colors were blush, gray, and neutrals. We wanted the look to be elegant, but still have that wine country backyard wedding feel. Our reception area was full of beautiful flowers from Tesoro, personal touches (my mom made a variety of amazing chalkboard art signs), and a giant tree that was lit and hung with 3 beautiful chandeliers (my dad s idea). It was breathtaking at night. We had market lights strung over the pool area, and a rustic barrel bar for refreshments. Chris and I own a winery Caddis, so we had plenty of wine to share with our guests.'
p865
aS'Chris and I decided to do a first look, we saw each other for the first time in the vineyard setting and was able to share a very special moment with just the two of us. This is where we shared our own personal vows. It was touching and private, and so very us. The ceremony was held on the far side of the house with two beautiful bouquets by Tesoro flanking the ceremony site. It was gorgeous. My mom walked me down the aisle and I couldn t keep my eyes off of Chris. It was a beautiful ceremony.'
p866
aS'After the ceremony wine and appetizers were served by the pool. Guests found their seats by checking the window pains of two vintage french doors that were hung for them to walk through. We worked with Dovetail Catering for our plated dinner and everyone is still talking about how fantastic the food was. Guests dined on the beautiful grass set beneath a lit tree with three chandeliers. Each table had a beautiful full flower centerpiece with hues of blush and white and large pillar candles to set the mood.'
p867
aS'At each place setting glass chargers were placed with beautiful blush napkins from La Tavola. I was a graphic designer in my last career so I designed escort cards and menus for each place setting.'
p868
aS'Our cake was delicious from A perfect ending. It was vanilla, with butter cream, and fresh strawberries. In addition to cake Chris and I both love ice cream so we had mint chip with a chocolate donut hole, or vanilla with a caramel donut hole for guests.'
p869
aS'We kicked off the dancing with our first dance to  on a night like this  by Dave Barnes and we didn t stop dancing for the rest of the night. At around 9pm Dovetail brought out the juiciest little sliders on brioche buns. It was the perfect snack for those still dancing the night away. Our guests left with a smores chocolate from Woodhouse Chocolates in St. Helena. It was the perfect little sweet to thank all of our guests for sharing this special day with us. We worked with Kelly from A Savvy Event through the entire process, she was able to provide amazing design ideas and really helped bring our whole vision to life.'

S'When an event planner ties the knot, there s no denying a little added pressure. And for this event pro turned bride, that meant pulling off a day her guests would remember forever. Designed with a French-vintage flair, these Sonoma lovies planned a wedding that set the style bar high, and Chestnut & Vine and Sweet On Cake made the details unforgettable. See it all from Onelove Photography right here.'
p915
aS'From The Bride My now husband (!) and I have been together for 10+ years. We really wanted to showcase our love for our family and friends. Being an event planner, everyone was expecting something GREAT! So, naturally the pressure was on. Our number one goal was for everyone to have the most amazing time. So many things contributed to this .the location, the music, the food and of course the drinks! We had gone up to BR Cohn many years ago and fell in love with their wine and Oyster Bar on Sundays. We remember thinking so many years ago what a great place it would be to get married. To be fortunate enough to have that dream come true was the best. Next, we LOVE food. It was super important to us for people to love the food and to keep it coming. Lastly, we don t get the opportunity to let loose and dance too often. Music was key and having a full dance floor from beginning to end is what we hoped for and came true!'
p916
aS'I am a lover of all things vintage! The wedding was designed around a French-Vintage feeling. I had so many ideas for what I wanted, almost too many! In the end it was exactly what I wanted with the perfect touch of elegance.'
p917
aS'I have been going to the Alameda Antique Fair for years and have been collecting antiques for quite some time. My husband always jokes with me and says how I love anything antique/vintage. Over a year plus span, I collected vintage mirror trays that I used for the centerpiece.'
p918
aS'Another significant piece were the skeleton keys on each mirror tray that had a wooden tag with a significant word hand written on each. Each word (cherish, love, family, adventure) represents our past, present and future. They were words that describe us as a couple.'
p919
aS'The day honestly could not have been better! Thank you to Amy, who is both my good friend and coordinator, everything went off without a hitch. Everything I had imagined came to life and could not have been more beautiful. During the reception, my husband told me to stop and take a look around. There was nothing more amazing then seeing all your closest family and friends together in one space and enjoying themselves. We never felt so much love from everyone as we did that day and particularly at that moment.'
p920
aS'We had a last dance planned for everyone,  I Left My Heart in San Francisco,  a nod to our favorite team, San Francisco Giants and the DJ had everyone make a circle around us as we danced just the two of us. This wasn t planned, but it was the absolute best way to end the day, surrounded by all of our loved ones.\n'

S'When black tie meets seaside, the result never fails to wow. Something wonderful always just seems to happen when bow ties and lace mix with toes in the sand. This new Mr. and Mrs. treated their guests to just such a perfectly elegant California evening where even the sunset right on queue, and thanks to Daniel Cruz s stunning images we can soak up all the lovely here.'

aS'While ethnically Korean, Joseph is pretty American as you get. And aside from her clerkship that led to her meeting Joseph, home has always been in Korea for Woosun. So as they began preparing for their wedding, with friends and family on two separate continents, they decided to hold two weddings. Along with the purpose of celebrating their marriage, each would also provide a time to highlight their own personal cultures and unique traditions. Woosun managed the planning of the Korea wedding, which was held in the intimate mountainside resort of Sam Cheong Gak in Seoul. The couple wore formal Korean wedding attire and were married in a very traditional Korean wedding ceremony. On the other hand, Joseph was the mastermind for the wedding in the States. The fact that he loves to surf and also lives only a few blocks away from the beach, easily convinced him to reserve a beachfront location for their U.S. ceremony and reception. While the occasion still required a suit and tie, the couple enjoyed a nice relaxing walk on the beach following the ceremony and appreciate together a beautiful California beach sunset before re-joining their guests and enjoying the American tradition of first dance as husband and wife!'
p962
aS'Regardless of location, backgrounds, and cultures, the one thing that resonated throughout both wedding occasions was the love that Woosun and Joseph shared and were committed to. And how wonderful they had not one, but two opportunities to make happy wedding memories!\n'

We have been inseparable ever since. Kyle proposed on a family vacation in Hawaii the week right after Christmas. we went on a date night, walked down to the beach to watch the sunset, and Kyle popped the question underneath a palm tree right as the sun was going down! With the help of Lara our wedding coordinator/planner, we selected the colors; gold, white, cream elegant, formal flowers- white hydrangeas, white roses to decorate our special day.'

S'If I had to sum up this LA lovefest a few words  chic,   glam  and  cool  would be at the very top of my list. Of course, a wedding this stylish comes as no surprise with a vendor team including The Little Branch, Bella Figura, Studio Castillero and Inclusion Films. Take a jaunt through the stunning affair here   Oh, and you just might recognize the Bride s famous aunt and uncle in the mix!'
p1052
aS'From The Bride After the surprise of the proposal (although we had been dating for 11 years since we met in sophomore English class) the reality set in that we had to plan a wedding. First on the agenda was a date and a venue. Surprisingly, those came easily. We knew we weren t country club, hotel ballroom, yacht club, or beach types and we weren t rugged outdoors types. That certainly limited our options in Los Angeles. But, as soon as we discovered the Smog Shoppe venue with its blank canvas, urban vibe we were sold. Since we live out of town in San Francisco, we knew we needed a wedding planner to coordinate. I found Nira DeLuna of Amber Events and right away I knew her laid back, confident energy was a perfect fit. Nira kept us on track from day one!'
p1053
aS'The Dress'
p1054
aS'The minute Jared proposed, my mother was in the car with the motor running wanting to just  go look  at dresses. Most brides-to-be have a vision of the perfect dress; I did not. This probably was good because I was willing to try on anything and everything and that was really fun. But, nothing felt like  the one.  After several trips to department stores and designer boutiques between Los Angeles and San Francisco, I happened on a San Francisco boutique, And Something Blue, which carried Trish Lee, a local designer. As soon as I put on the Trish Lee dress, I knew it was right! I paired it with my grandmother s antique diamond and jade hanging earrings for a pop of color ( something old ) and I had my mother s wedding veil recut for the perfect accompaniment ( something borrowed ). Jared surprised my on the day with a beautiful diamond necklace for  something new!  And the groom looked handsome in his Hugo Boss tuxedo!'
p1055
aS'The Venue'
p1056
aS'As soon as we set foot in Smog Shoppe, we knew we didn t have to look any further. It s a unique venue because it has a lot of quirky details: the succulent walls, bookshelves with knickknacks, and vintage furniture were great additions to our vision for the space. Smog Shoppe has a great open vibe and indoor-outdoor space which is great for a May wedding in LA.'
p1057
aS'  The Invitations '
p1058
aS'Bella Figura designed letterpress invitations in simple, classic black and cream, a themed which we carried throughout the wedding with our printed menus and table numbers. We really liked the contrast of the classic font with our asymmetric, bohemian floral arrangements. We also loved the fact that Bella Figura will include complimentary table cards that in lieu of wedding favors, we would be donating to our favorite charities.'
p1059
aS'D cor & Design '
p1060
aS'Beyond a few inspiration photos found online, we really needed some help crafting an overall look for the space. I liked the idea of having a lot of gold candlesticks on the table and small vessels and arrangements and a seasonal palate. When we met with Meg and Annie from The Little Branch, they did a really great job to guiding me toward look we really loved. This began a very organic process of building our design concept; one layer at a time. Together we chose saturated gilded tones of burgundy, mustard, brass, gold, rose gold, dusty rose and corals. The big blooms and whimsical flowers were wrapped in gold for my bouquet. The groom s bout was textures with mustard and burgundy tones.'
p1061
aS'They also designed our birch chuppah with simple branchy asymmetrical florals in Boho style to set against the backdrop of the succulent wall at the Smog Shoppe. The gold mercury urns, vintage brass vases and gold and glittered bud vases were filled with arrangements of flowers they used including: Ranunculus, Anemones, Peonies, Garden Roses, Butterfly Hydrangea, Spanish Moss, and Gold Painted Succulents. I had collected large vintage varied gold frames that they suspended on the wall behind the dessert table with floral arrangements within the frame. One hundred varied gold mercury votives were on the reception tables and throughout the room. Various sized glass vases were filled with brass candlesticks and candles.'
p1062
aS'The chestnut wood tables included gold flatware, gold-rimmed china, mixed-matched vintage glassware and custom made linen runners and mixed cloth vintage design patterned napkins from an amazing Etsy designer, Dotandarmy.'
p1063
aS'Since our beloved basset- hound mix, Verne, couldn t attend the wedding, we wanted to show our obsession with dogs in a few of the details The escort table was made up of gold spray painted dogs with hand calligraphy names. Everyone loved the dogs so much  they were almost as popular as Heirloom s chicken and waffle appetizer. We had an entrance table with photos of family members who were with us in spirit. Also, a large glass vessel was filled with mini chocolate bars with a hand-wrapped picture of our dog in a top hat and tux!'
p1064
aS'The Food'
p1065
aS'We chose Heirloom LA for their organic, farm-to-table philosophy. From the tasting salon to the menu preparation to the final day s execution, they were professional, easy to work with and so delicious! We had hot and cold tray passed appetizers for the cocktail hour including their famous chicken & waffles. When guests arrived at their tables they found an Heirloom LA crostini platter with fresh milk cheeses, organic vegetables and house-made crostini and dips. A plated salad of the chef s choice of seasonal market green and fruits was served before a meal of Beef Shank Osso Bucco with Risotto and Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Pan Roasted John Dory with Green Artichokes, Sauteed Papini & Cherry Tomato Bruschetta, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Chef s  Trust Us  Vegetables were served family style. Our guests loved that they were able to try everything!'
p1066
aS'The Sweet Buffet & Coffee Bar'
p1067
aS'The Little Branch and Heirloom LA designed a spectacular Dessert Table around my vintage throw and cake platters. We chose his and hers 9 cutting cakes in Red Velvet with Cream Cheese Frosting and Vanilla with Fresh Seasonal Berries and a selection of Heirloom desserts including: Seasonal Pie Squares, Chocolate Locket Cookies and  Nside Out Smores.  Our guests enjoyed the dessert and coffee bar all night as they danced the night away!'
p1068
aS'The Music'
p1069
aS'We chose Jason Sulkin s alternative string trio (guitar, cello and violin) to provide the live ceremony and cocktail hour music. We chose a different song for the groom and bridal party s procession, the bride s procession and the couple s recession. The Smog Shoppe doesn t have a very long aisle but, Jason edited the music seamlessly. It was beautiful! Tony Liebetrau of Red Shoe Productions was our live DJ/Master of Ceremony and he set the perfect tone for the reception while keeping the party moving with music that all ages could enjoy!'

aS'Photography & Videography'
p1071
aS'I knew the look I wanted for our photos so Nira recommended Megan and Brent at Studio Castillero. Jared and I wanted to do our family photos before the ceremony so we wouldn t miss the cocktail hour while taking photos. The reveal was at The Culver Hotel where we were all staying. This historic location is so beautiful and we knew it would make our photos special. I was so nervous I told my parents and Jared s mother in our suite that it would be just us and the photographers for the reveal, but Jared invited his groomsmen and his family! Luckily, the photographers were so amazing and they captured everything from the reveal, the ceremony, all the decorative details of the reception and all our guests and family!'
p1072
aS'My father s film crew (Andy and John) from Inclusion Films captured the whole event and along with my dad created a beautiful video memory. The Stylish Fox provided the  photo booth.  They set up the booth utilizing the beautiful chuppah/succulent wall background. They provided a photographer and props then printed out 4  by 6  photos right there on the spot. We added our touch by having a lifesize cut-out of our dog to take photos with  it was the biggest hit of the night! We had a scrapbook table with scrapbooking paraphernalia and guest were asked to add a page to the book. This made for a hilarious keepsake.'

S'Some venues are so gorgeous that they end up guiding the rest of the wedding planning. For this couple, Vine Hill House in California s luscious wine country proved to be that dream spot. And with florals by Poppystone, it s no wonder their day is becoming one of my all-time faves. See each lovely detail captured by Christina McNeill in the full gallery here.'
p1167
aS'From the Bride  We always knew we wanted to get married in the northern California wine country, and when we toured Vine Hill House we knew right away that it was perfect for our wedding. The venue is so stunning on its own, I wanted to keep the design of the wedding simple and elegant, but still warm and just a little country. We ended up with mostly white flowers with accents of natural greens and yellow. We also added some beautiful natural wood pieces, like the chairs and the lounge area benches. All together the wedding turned out so beautiful and tasteful   even more so then we could have imagined!'
p1168
aS'Our favorite part of the wedding was our first look! The moment we saw each other all of our nerves melted away. Anything is possible with your best friend by your side! It was one of the most intimate moments we had on our wedding day, and it was so easy to go with the flow and enjoy the entire wedding after that! '
p1169
aS'One piece of advice another bride (she was also one of my bridesmaids!) gave me was to not start looking at too many design ideas until you book your venue. The venue can add so much to the design and feel of the wedding it is easier to pick your colors, theme, and d cor after that is locked down.\n'

S'Vespas and umbrian feasts are two very awesome ways to incorporate Italy into a California wedding. It also helps to have a team of wedding elves to take that vision and make it a reality. Talents like Sweet Marie Designs, LVL Weddings & Events and wildly beautiful images by Ashley Kelemen. Together they masterminded an elegant affair filled with white blooms and al fresco details. See it all unfold here.'
p1222
aS'From Ashley Kelemen Kate and Nate s wedding was an absolute dream. They carefully incorporated so many personal details, and created a Umbrian feast to remember. From their custom Italian meal from Heirloom LA to the rented Vespa the Kate surprised Nate with, the wedding day was special from beginning to end. Sweet Marie Designs  signature florals were stunning as always, and included a hidden artichoke in the brides bouquet (which held special meaning to the bride and groom) and cumquats in the arrangements for a touch of whimsy. Kate and Nate s wedding artfully highlighted the things they love most as a couple   family, friends, food and wine.'
p1223
aS'From Heather of LVL Events...Washington DC love birds imagined a California wedding that was more than going through the motions of tradition, that truly encompassed who they are as a couple and provided an intimate dinner party to share with friends and family. The dinner party theme was born and allowed us to incorporate the textured, details and feel of their travels and celebrations in Orvieto, Italy.\n'

aS'From Mirelle Carmichael Photography I had the pleasure of photographing this adorable couple s engagement session on a perfect day in San Francisco. We started at the Bernal Heights hill with an epic view of the city, then headed to Stern Grove and discovered a gorgeous flower bed, and ended the day at Ocean Beach, where they got engaged! The beautiful bride, Morgan, wore a swoon-worthy skirt from Modcloth, a dress from Gap and a gorgeous yellow sweater from Urban Outfitters. The handsome groom, Zach, wore a shirts from Uniqlo, boots from Red Wing, and a denim jacket from Rag & Bone.\n'

S'These two classic cuties have me swooning hard today. Not only is grandma s sweet smile while watching their first dance completely heart melting, but every little detail is tradition at it s finest. From the venue selection, the Lakeside Olympic Club where the Bride s family have made many memories to the wedding cake replica of her grandparent s cake, Lyndsay Undseth made sure every moment made it s way into this gallery.'
p1290
aS'From Linen & Lilac The vision for this wedding came together with a lot of special attention from all the vendors, but most especially from the bride and her mother. The jumping off point were the colors peach, brass, and gold- simple, classy, and perfect for the bride and groom s venues of Calvary Presbyterian Church and the Lakeside Olympic Club in San Francisco. Since the Lakeside Club holds many family memories for the bride and her family, they were thrilled to host the reception at this elegant traditional venue. From hand selected vintage brass vases to the heirloom cake cutting knife to the hand painted trinkets placed atop each table setting, many items were lovingly collected by the bride and her mother. One especially touching example of the family s attention to detail was the wedding cake, which was a replica of the bride s grandparent s wedding cake complete with her grandparent s vintage wedding topper! The flawless venue, collaboration of all the vendors, warm colors, and special family touches made this a wedding to remember.'

S'I find rainy day weddings seriously dreamy, and this stunning nuptial is all the proof I need. This couple was literally showered with love on their big day, a lucky omen that proved to be incredibly romantic. Overflowing with beautiful arrangements by Reina, and magical moments captured by Stacey Pentland you can t help but smile when you see the outpouring of love here.'
p1349
aS'From The Bride Ashley and KC s big day had been nine years in the making. They met the first day of new student orientation in undergrad and their backgrounds could not have been more diverse. KC was a well-traveled, international tennis player and Ashley was a small town, country girl with an upbringing in rodeo. But, 2 people, 9 years later, picked March 2-9 as the perfect date to tie the knot.'
p1350
aS'Holman Ranch, one valley over from Ashley s family ranch, was the perfect combination of rustic, ranching roots and timeless, classic style to complement the bride and groom s divergent backgrounds and unique tastes. And, their love for the outdoors made Holman s breathtaking views the obvious choice.'
p1351
aS'To lessen the chances of rain, the couple picked a date in late spring. With California experiencing an unprecedented drought, the odds were in their favor. Go figure, the selected date turned out to be the only Saturday rain day of the year, with record rainfall.'
p1352
aS'Disappointed at first, the couple soon realized they could not have asked for a more romantic, mystical day, showered with true love and heavenly tears of joy. The heavy rainfall above the tents during the couple s vows was refreshing and cleansing. Being drenched in pure bliss and soaked in endless happiness, the weather forecast was nothing short of a miracle!'
p1353
aS'The old superstition that rain on your wedding day is a lucky omen surely flooded true. As one friend analogized,  Tying a wet knot will hold tighter than any other. \n'

aS'From The Bride Justin and I are both from Canada originally, but we met and got engaged here in Los Angeles, by the beach. We wanted our wedding to be romantic and traditional yet unstuffy, and to reflect what we both love so much about California. Having our reception at Casa Del Mar, an oceanfront hotel rich in Santa Monica history was the perfect fit. Our color scheme of blush pink, white and gold ran through all aspects of the event from our invitations to the bridesmaid dresses to the florals. Our bouquets and arrangements also had plenty of greenery in them which helped to lend a lush, California-casual vibe to the decor. It was really important to us that our guests, many of whom had flown in from other countries, have an amazing time and our band did a great job of getting everyone up and dancing from the second the reception started to the last song of the night.\n'

S'I love this elopement story. First off, two artists tying the knot under the entwined branches and lemon trees at Echo Park is pure romance in my book. And when they serendipitously bumped into the lovely and talented Betsi Ewing on the way to their wedding dinner? Well that s a fabulous story, I d say, and makes for a one-of-a-kind gallery.'
p1409
aS'From the beautiful Bride About two weeks before we departed for Los Angeles, we booked the trip thinking it would be a great opportunity to soak up inspiration from California to be used towards our separate creative projects Ryan creates instrumental hip-hop and I (Mandy) work with leather, primarily children s moccasins from the pattern handed down by my grandmother. A few days before we left Canada, we had the discussion with one another and decided that this would be trip that we come home married from.'
p1410
aS'We locked down an officiant to do his duty a few days after we arrived but only brought the ceremony clothes for Ryan, as I hoped to find a vintage dress in Echo Park or Silver Lake. The day before we eloped, I finally found a beautiful vintage Indian cotton dress with lace across the chest from a truck called Selvedge Dry Goods who was parked on Sunset Blvd in Echo Park. As for a location, we were lucky enough to stumble on a charming and hidden path in the hills of Echo Park that featured a small stream of running water, a beautiful view, and a wide selection of vegetation (lemon trees, overgrown cacti, black bamboo and palm trees) which surrounded tiny artist cottages. In addition to my dress, we bought wedding bands from downtown and a bridal bouquet from Silver Lake, that included sage, which is a sacred plant from my culture.'
p1411
aS'During our private and intimate wedding ceremony, we exchanged rings and we pledged to honour and tenderly care for each other, to cherish, and to encourage each other s growth and fulfilment through all the changes of our lives.'
p1412
aS'After the ceremony, we ordered a taxi via email (since we were without cell service to call) to drive us to our dinner reservation to a French restaurant in the neighbourhood, but it didn t show. Since we were already cutting it close, we decided to walk. Thankfully we did because as we headed in what seemed to be the right direction, we were lucky enough to run into Besti and her cute dog, Stella, on the street. She asked us if we had just gotten married and mentioned that she could spot a bride from a mile away because she was a wedding photographer and she very generously offered to snap some photos of us! It was very serendipitous and the photos that Betsi took captured the moment perfectly! Instead of calling us a cab, she and her friend were kind enough to offer us a ride to our wedding dinner. We arrived ten minutes late, and thankfully the restaurant offered free wifi, which is how we shared our elopement and all of the events that occurred afterwards on Instagram and Twitter under #elopedincali so that friends back home could enjoy the evening with us despite the distance.'

S'It s hard for any of us to imagine planning a wedding this beautiful in just three weeks, but when you combine a talented bride with a network of incredible vendors well, anything is possible. Oh, and if the gorgeous photos from Buena Lane Photography are any indication, their big day went off without a hitch. Treat yourself to the full gallery here.'
p1450
aS'From the Groom  I d been thinking about marrying Alissa as long as I ve known her. There was something about that morning. On her birthday I woke up and said,  This will be the day.  I didn t even have a ring. We went for a hike in Harper Canyon, a special place to us. At the top of the trail I shouted,  Will you marry me?  so loudly it echoed through the canyons. She said,  Yes. '
p1451
aS'From the Bride  We made our guest list in 5 minutes while driving home. After sharing the big news with our families we also let them know we had a short engagement and quick wedding in mind. We considered eloping but decided that we wanted our closest family and friends to be present to support our commitment. Our idea of a dream wedding was intimate, stress free, delicious, warm, and simply beautiful. We wanted to do each detail well and not be concerned about expense. '
p1452
aS'Anthony first told me  I love you  in Santa Barbara. That is one reason why we thought it would be the perfect town to return to for our wedding. Anthony loves being near the water and I love the Spanish influences present in the town. Most of our close family and friends reside in Northern or Southern California so Santa Barbara is a perfect mid-point. San Ysidro Ranch was the dream location to host 45 of our favorite people. Anthony took the train from LA to Santa Barbara and I drove down from Monterey to visit the property. We booked our wedding for 3 weeks from that day! '
p1453
aS'With 3 weeks to plan the wedding we only had to make 5 major selections to make. Having a swift wedding prevented us from getting lost in the minutia and allowed us to focus on doing a few things quite well: 1. dress 2. flowers 3. photographer 4. location 5. suit '
p1454
aS'I am a letterpress printer and work in the wedding business. Thankfully I ve been exposed to many talented people in the industry and it was simple for me to ask the best folks to be involved in our wedding. I trusted each one explicitly and was so excited to have their talents poured into our impromptu day.'
p1455
aS'It is important to note here that our wedding was on a Tuesday. We were really on an unconventional kick it seems. We picked that day because it worked for our families and businesses  we both work for ourselves. Plus, we wanted the day to feel like an island   away from the rest of the world. Having the wedding on a Tuesday delivered that feeling like a weekend never could.'
p1456
aS'On the day of our wedding, my best friend Cassie, my mom, and I got ready in a cottage at SYR. We did our own hair and make-up and relaxed with a bottle of champagne. Anthony spent the morning with his best friends. The wedding was at 11:00am so the ceremony really snuck up on us! I will note here that the day involved lots of happy tears. I started crying in the cottage  first when my mom prayed with Cassie, my sisters and me, then when my Grandpa came to say goodbye, and finally just when I thought I would make it out of there without crying anymore my dad pulled me aside and said a few of the kindest words to me. Thank God for fake eyelashes.'
p1457
aS'From Buena Lane Photography  Alissa and Anthony had planned to elope or have a simple ceremony at the courthouse, but when they visited San Ysidrio Ranch in Santa Barbara, they couldn t resist the idea of an imitate celebration on this stunning property. Their ceremony and reception were so elegant and stylish, it s hard to believe the whole thing was planned in THREE WEEKS. Not only that, but the bride spent two of those weekends in friends  wedding parties and the last moving her letterpress business from the Central Coast down to Los Angeles.'
p1458
aS'Alissa and Anthony knew their priority was to be married and living together in LA and Alissa knew she d end up filling a long engagement with new tasks to fuss over and worry over decisions that hadn t been made. '
p1459
aS'After a touching ceremony beneath the mountain, guests were invited to the hacienda lawn for lemonade followed by lunch on the wine cellar patio. Alissa and Anthony s classic style complimented the charm of San Ysidro, which is rich with Old Hollywood lore. In the end, they created a lovely, romantic soiree reminiscent of the days when Audrey Hepburn and Jackie O. holidayed in Montecito.\n'

p1545
aS'From Kaysha Weiner Photographer Our super sweet couple met at the UCLA Library 9 years ago, and they both love to read so it makes sense that they d want to incorporate such a personal touch to their wedding. Thoughtful details like library card invitations, the couples initials made out of books for the sweetheart table, and a collection of vintage books that belonged to the bride s mother and her family were pulled in to enhance the library romance.'
p1546
aS'The Smog Shoppe was the perfect setting for family and friends to witness this union. They were treated to yummy bites and a delicious dinner courtesy of Angie Orsino and her fantastic team from Tender Greens Catering. The seriously gorgeous florals were created by Twig & Twine, and the perfect ending to a lovely and heartfelt evening were the desserts by Sweet & Saucy.'
p1547
aS'Beautifully, what was more apparent then any theme was the true love these two felt for one another. Throughout the planning process I was able to see how much they cared for and complemented one another. It was a happy lesson in love and understanding and so wonderful to witness. I ll admit I tend to get a tiny bit fluttery during wedding ceremonies, but usually no tears. That being said, I honest to goodness choked up when I heard her say during her vows  If someone had told me 9 years ago that I would marry the boy from the library, I would not have believed it. But I am so grateful and happy that my life has lead me to this moment with you  Gah. Love them.'
p1548
aS'Everything was perfectly encapsulated by the talented Kaysha, of Kaysha Weiner Photographer. She thoughtfully captured their personalities and family dynamic along with all of the prettiness of the day.'
p1549
aS'From The Bride We met at a library where we both worked in college. When it was time to decide on a theme for our wedding, I knew I wanted it to be something that represented who we are but still simple. We re both big readers, so a wedding that was inspired by books and libraries just made sense. The books in our centerpieces were mostly books that belonged to my mother and her siblings when they were growing up in the 60s. It was really special to me that I got to use something from my family in the wedding.'
p1550
aS'One of my favorite parts of the wedding was the soundtrack. Our DJs were amazing. There were so many moments during the wedding where I was smiling just because the music was so good.'
p1551
aS'My advice for people planning a wedding is that vendors are important. We asked a lot of questions before we hired our vendors. We looked for things like professionalism, punctuality, and attention to detail. By looking for these traits during the hiring process, we were more confident that our day would run smoothly.'

aS'My other advice is to do what you want. Weddings are expensive, and they go by in a flash. So don t do what you think other people want or need, just focus on yourselves. Spend your money on what s important to you.\n'

S'Now that you ve swooned part one of this perfectly styled lovefest, it s time to dive into the celebration that follows. I m talking a reception table decked out with sprawling blooms, gold accents and an Edison bulb chandelier that ll rock your world. Cloudless Weddings filmed the affair designed in the hands of Brooke Keegan, and Marisa Holmes snapped the gallery with so much more.'
p1605
aS'From Brooke Keegan Weddings And Events For the dining table, we wanted to bring in a little bit of the industrial feel from the Ceremony into the Reception. AK Johnston Group hung vintage Edison bulbs over the table top and we once again used the metal  X  back chairs. The wood table and romantic and lush flowers were accompanied by a screen printed hemstitch napkin. We gathered them with a leather band with the guests name beautifully written on it in gold by KA Kalligraphy. '
p1606
aS'Who needs bread? We had the sweet B. Toffee treat on each b&b plate. Instead of a traditional cake, we went with a B.Toffee cake. Something that the guys were able to break a piece off of and still do the ceremonial exchange. We set up a Cigar and Scotch bar for later that evening. It is always a fun idea when you have a group of guys that love to sit around and chat. Once the guests got back to their room, there was a Hangover Kit waiting so that they could prepare themselves for the morning that was to come from all the fun drinking the evening before. Doesn t the Bloody Mary look amazing!? It is the Alchemy Hail Mary, which is bacon infused vodka, homemade bloody mary mix and pickled vegetables.\n'

aS'At first, they had both thought Carmel, CA would be a beautiful place to have their wedding. However, as the planning process began Erica started to want the wedding to have more significance by hosting it at Spencer s family ranch in Tahoe or in a church in her family s home town in Italy. They picked Tahoe and started planning right away, however a few months of trying to make the wedding work in Tahoe, they realized the location was not ideal to have a wedding there. They decided to give up that plan, regroup, and start planning the affair in Italy (which had always been Erica a dream wedding location). The process was going very smoothly with all the plans for their Italian wedding, up until there was an earthquake in Italy that made the church not safe to have their ceremony in anymore. You would think any bride would be at the point of giving up and emotionally tired of trying to plan anything at this point, but Erica didn t let any of it bother her one bit and laughed at the all the unfortunate events. '
p1657
aS'They finally both decided that the wedding was meant to be where they had originally decided at the Mission Basilica in Carmel, a Catholic Church very similar to the one in Italy that Erica s Grandparents were married in.\n\nThe wedding turned out BEAUTIFULLY, every detail was simple and sweet. Also, just like Erica and Spencer, it was a down to earth and classy affair with all their close friends and family. A day to truly be remembered. The part I loved most about this wedding were the flowers. The flowers were perfect in every way possible. Fleurs Du Soleil filled the church and reception room with lovely smelling pink peonies (Erica s favorite) and other beautiful flower arrangements. Erica is a floral designer herself, so of course the flowers would be beautiful and very memorable just as she is.\n'

S'Brooke Keegan is one of those planners who can do no wrong. So when she set out to design a masculine-yet-totally-romantic shoot you better believe she nailed it. With details like leather letter-pressed invites alongside moody hues and lush blooms (kudos, Holly Flora!) the resulting shots from Marisa Holmes are nothing short of wedding heaven. Psst: there s even more pretty coming up next.'
p1710
aS'From Brooke Keegan Weddings and Events I really wanted to do a wedding inspiration shoot that displayed masculinity without losing the touch of romance and elegance. JP and Julz are my clients, a real couple, getting married in the Fall of 2015. I knew they were the perfect couple for this project! There are so many details that go into a destination wedding and I wanted to feature several of those elements. '
p1711
aS'The letter pressed leather invites and paper goods were created by Wiley Valentine. Masculine yet formal. A Welcome Gift is the perfect touch upon arrival. You always want to include 3 elements in the gift: hydration (non-alcoholic more importantly than alcoholic), snacks and pampering items. After a long flight, most guests like to throw their feet up, grab a drink and a snack and relax! The Ceremony was created by Holly Flora   lush and romantic, yet industrial with the metal  X  back chairs. '
p1712
aS'We did small scotch bottles for the escort cards and served specialty mixed drinks at Cocktail Hour. The signature cocktail was a Smokey Mora from Alchemy San Diego: 2 oz Mescal (preferably single village) mixed with 6 fresh muddled blackberries, 0.5 oz Lemon Juice, then strain over ice and top with a splash of soda water, garnish with a blackberry and fresh mint. They were accompanied by several mini hors d oeuvres. Food presentation can really add to your overall decor!\n'

Events, every image snapped up by Alders Photography makes my heart sing, and I m pretty sure they will make your heart sing too. '

aS'The couple chose to be alone when they saw each other for the first time and it was such a sweet moment. Soon their wedding party joined them and we were off for photos. Then the ceremony took place at just the tight time for the perfect light. Lauren was just the sweetest during the nuptials, her emotions overwhelming her. Between tears of joy were smiles and laughter as well. It was so wonderful to document!'
p1757
aS'The reception was just gorgeous. This area at Calamigos might be my favorite for the reception. I really love being able to get above the tables to gain a unique perspective! Touching speeches from the groom s brothers and the bride s friends and mother kicked off a really fun night. Mindy Roderick of Mindy Events ensured that the day ran flawlessly!\n'

aS'From the beautiful Bride Dean and I met in San Diego in 2012. After convincing myself that I could move all of my furniture on my own, moving day came and I realized that I was in some serious need of help. I called my nearby friend Phil and asked that he bring as many friends as he could to help. Turns out, most of these friends were not in any condition to help the morning after an  all nighter . The only person willing to help was Phil s friend, Dean.'
p1777
aS'Dean showed up with the biggest smile on his face and I specifically remember thinking to myself; now, this is the kind of man that I want to marry. I actually remember being upset after meeting him because I was under the impression that he was already taken. I guess I just assumed that someone this incredible and kind had to already be taken off the market. Turns out, he wasn t and I couldn t be more grateful. The week after we met, I went to my home state of Colorado to visit. Upon returning, I learned that Dean had been trying to get a hold of me, but was (without his knowledge) given the wrong number by our mutual friends. The next time I saw him, he was overly apologetic thinking that I hadn t returned his calls or texts because he was too forward. After assuring him that he just had the wrong number we finally went on our first date and have spent almost every single day together since.'
p1778
aS'Together for nearly two years, I was more than ready to become his wife but with no indication from him, figured an engagement was still a long time away. When I woke up one Sunday morning, Dean handed me a cup of coffee and a note explaining that he was taking me away for a couple of days on a surprise trip for our  birthdays . The note was complete with a packing list and the reassurance that he had already called my boss to tell him I wouldn t be at work Monday morning. I had no idea where we were going until we arrived at the Dana point marina. I then knew we were headed to Catalina Island, a place I had been longing to visit since we started dating.'
p1779
aS'Once we finally set foot on Catalina we enjoyed an amazing day of exploring the island, eating to our hearts content and just enjoying one another s company. After lunch, Dean mentioned that we needed to start getting ready for dinner and told me that he rented a sailboat and wanted to have a sunset cruise before our dinner reservations that night. I thought this was a little suspicious (and over the top) for our birthday but refused to let my mind wander to the thoughts of our engagement in fear of being let down if it didn t happen.'
p1780
aS'After spending about an hour on the boat we came to a point where we were literally surrounded by hundreds of dolphins and sea lions all swimming together surrounding the boat. Even the captain of the boat mentioned that he had never seen anything like it. At this point I was so distracted with trying to capture pictures of the circus happening in the water around us, that getting engaged was the furthest thing from my mind. Not even a minute later, Dean got down on one wobbly knee and asked me to be his fianc e. Turns out, this weekend was to celebrate the beginning of the rest of our lives together. That moment is one that I wish I could relive a million times over because I don t think I have ever been so overwhelmed with joy in my life.'
p1781
aS'When the incredible Carmen Santorelli and I started to brainstorm where we should take our engagement photos it seemed only fateful that a sailboat engagement session was something she too had been dreaming of and gathering inspiration for, for quite some time. When she told me about this, I knew that this would be the perfect backdrop to tell the story of where this chapter in our story began.\n'

S'Every now and then a wedding comes along that nearly leaves me without words. I m talking those weddings that push the envelope of pretty and make me thank my lucky stars to be a part of this little ol  blog. But sure enough, when it s vendors like Joy Proctor, Camellia Floral Designs, Aria Studios and KT Merry behind the scenes, events like that just naturally unfold. The story starts with this duo s gorgeous engagement and ends in the full wedding gallery waiting right here.'
p1837
aS'From the Bride  James and I are both very close to our families, so when searching for a location we envisioned a venue where we could celebrate the coming together of our two families. When we first set foot on the grounds of Sunstone Villa, we knew it was absolutely perfect for us! Not only were the Villa and surrounding vineyards utterly breathtaking, but our families were also able to stay with us at the Villa through the weekend. Looking back now, we realized that our families being together in the days leading up to our wedding was just as precious as our actual wedding day. We could not have imagined a more perfect location!'
p1838
aS'James and I wanted our wedding to be simple, timeless and romantic, yet also full of fun and warmth. We wanted our decor elements to be very personal and selected items we knew we d eventually display in our home. We made several trips to our local antique faire searching for vintage trays, frames and containers. Our favorite find was the large antique gold frame we used as our escort card display. When we first found the frame, it was in desperate need of a little TLC. After a couple visits to the hardware store and through some trial and error, James and I were able to bring the frame back to life! The fact that we pulled an all-nighter restoring the frame made displaying it so much more meaningful. We also spent months collecting candles, votives and hurricanes and placed them all over the Villa to add a beautiful glow. We especially loved working with Carolyn Jane and Angelique Ink to create custom hand calligraphy signs, escort and place cards, menus and programs. They added the perfect personal touch to our wedding day.'
p1839
aS'Music is very important to us and we wanted the music at our wedding to be a reflection of our relationship. Over the course of our engagement, we continuously added songs to our  wedding playlist.  By the end, we had enough songs to fill the entire day! Hearing our selections played throughout the day was incredibly special, in particular our first dance song, which we had chosen on our very first date!!'
p1840
aS'The best advice I could give any bride is to choose experienced vendors they can wholeheartedly trust to execute their big day. We were told that our wedding day would fly by quickly but had no idea what that truly meant until it was actually happening! Luckily, we had an amazing team to support us and ensure every detail was attended to so that we could focus on spending time with our family and friends. Our coordinator, Joy, of Joy Proctor Design, was a dream to work with and quite possibly the sweetest person we ve ever met! From day one, she gave us amazing advice on the planning process and was an invaluable partner. On top of that, she has an amazing eye for design; we knew we could trust her to bring our wedding vision to life! Our photographer, KT Merry, and her assistant, Chad, made the perfect team and captured the precious moments of our big day beautifully. KT and Chad were by our side the entire day and made us feel extremely comfortable in front of the camera. They were super sweet, patient and consummate professionals who executed with expert precision. We also absolutely adored our videographers, Aria Studios. They were so nice and fun to hang out with, like being with old friends. They re based in Hawaii and braved not one, but two(!) hurricane warnings just to make it to our wedding! Watching their incredible Same Day Edit video at our reception was the perfect way to end the best day of our lives.'
p1841
aS'The SDE video, together with the quiet excitement of our first look, our adorable nieces and nephews as our flower girls and ring bearers, our first dance, the reactions we had to our SURPRISE horse-drawn carriage ride, making lifelong memories with our families, hearing the amazing speeches from our closest friends, and especially seeing James at the end of our ceremony aisle were some of the best moments of our wedding. All the planning and focusing on the details were definitely worth it! We could not have asked for more!'
p1842
aS'From Joy of Joy Proctor Design  I had the pleasure of helping Inga and James with planning for their beautiful wedding at Sunstone Villa. Inga chose a muted color palate of blush and peach paired with soft greens and greys to compliment the understated elegance of the venue.'
p1843
aS'Guests were greeted with lavender lemonade before making their way to the ceremony. Estate urns filled with organic florals by Cameilla Design sat on either side of the aisle, creating the most elegant entrance to the  I dos  which were held under and old oak tree. After the ceremony, Inga and James invited guests to join them for cocktails and bean toss before taking a quick moment to look out over their wedding from a balcony above. As a wedding gift, the grooms sister surprised them with a horse drawn carriage ride at sunset. Before making their way to dinner, guests found their calligraphy seating assignments by Carolyn Jane Design on a large gold frame backed in dupioni silk. Walking through the home to the reception, guests were greeted with more than 200 candles lining the stairwell and foyer tables   creating a truly romantic welcome to dinner.'
p1844
aS'The dinner reception was held in front of the house, with European market lights hanging over head. The bride and groom sat with their bridal party at a long wooden table from the Tent Merchant with a beautiful ivory dupioni silk runner from La Tavola linen. Guests sat at round tables covered in the same ivory dupioni linen with two beautiful centerpieces mixed throughout the tables. Rustic stoneware chargers and ornate silver flatware sat at each place setting, with a dinner menu tied in jute and a sprig of rosemary.'

S'If classic, understated glamour is your jam, you might want to brew another cup of coffee and feast your eyes on this loveliness SMPers. I personally blame my obsession with this gallery on the Bride s dress. That gorgeeeous custom Pronovias dress. Isn t it a dream? It sets the stage for each timeless detail that follows. Lyndsay Undseth Photography sits behind every darling moment right here in the gallery.'
p1910
aS'From the beautiful Bride Chad and I are college sweethearts and having lived in California since I moved from the east coast for school, he thoughtfully proposed in my home city of Boston. We decided to be married in San Francisco where we currently live, and chose April as it is the month of our dating anniversary. My mom is originally from the Bay Area and I had dreamed of being married in the iconic Grace Cathedral where she was confirmed as a teenager. Chad and I wanted our wedding to be classic with a simple elegance that would stand the test of time, and the Fairmont across the street was perfect for the reception with its traditional glamour and rich San Francisco history. We had guests travel from 15 different states, so we were thrilled that they could stay on Nob Hill and easily walk to both venues!'
p1911
aS'I planned and designed our big day myself with the help of my incredible mom but without a planner, so you can imagine the hours I spent scouring the internet for inspiration and vendors during our 16 month engagement! We didn t have a theme or even  wedding colors  per se  I just made sure the printed and d cor items were any combination of cream, taupe, white, gold and/or silver and let everything coordinate rather than match perfectly. I chose long chiffon dresses in pewter for the bridesmaids and they carried pale pink and white bouquets. For the reception, we added a bolder pink to the mostly white flowers for a pop of color. Because the Gold Room was so ornate already, we were careful to keep the d cor understated rather than opulent.'
p1912
aS'One of my favorite parts of the planning process was designing my dress with the delightful alterations team at Novella Bridal. I knew I wanted to look traditional with a modern twist (whatever that meant!!) and have always loved the idea of long sleeves on brides, but did not want to look old or outdated. Many years ago before weddings were even remotely on my radar, I stumbled across a picture online of a stunningly simple one of a kind dress made in Italy. I remember thinking it was the most beautiful wedding dress I had ever seen. So I found that picture again and used it as my inspiration. I ordered the Pronovias  Dalia  dress and completely transformed the top (for a mere fraction of the price of other dresses I considered!). I am a less is more kind of girl and the final result was exactly the classically traditional yet modern look I was going for.'
p1913
aS'Deciding who would document our big day was not easy, but hiring Lyndsay Undseth Photography and Luke Goodman Cinematography proved to be two of the best decisions we made. They were so calm, kind and unobtrusive, and captured all of the candid moments of joy with ease. They are truly incredible artists and we are thrilled to be able to relive it all through their beautiful work. All of our vendors went above and beyond to make sure the day was flawless and stress free, and we are so thankful!! Our wedding day was incredible and having everyone we love most in one room was the most amazing feeling. I will never forget how I felt walking down the aisle toward the love of my life surrounded and supported by our amazing families and friends.\n'

There s just something so wildly beautiful about the intimacy of a small wedding and with Kurt Boomer on hand to photograph and Lunch Pail Pictures capturing the magic on film, this gallery is where you want to be. It s a mix of gorgeous calligraphy by Valentina Glidden and blooms by Brier Rose Design.'

We had only our immediate family there and 3 very close friends and that was it. We wanted it to be us and something that represented our lives and relationship and that it was! It was a celebration of our marriage and starting our lives together and it could not have been any more perfect! Our photographer Kurt Boomer and cinematographer Lunch Pail Pictures did an absolutely incredible job capturing our day and telling our story for us! We will forever cherish what they have captured!'

aS'From the beautiful Bride Derek and I started dating in high school and have been inseparable ever since. Naturally, I started browsing for wedding inspiration years before getting engaged. When it finally came time to plan our own wedding eleven years later, there were so many different details I wanted to incorporate but nothing seemed to flow. Once I picked out my wedding dress, which was the very first wedding dress I tried on, everything started coming together. My wedding gown inspired the romantic and classic feel of our wedding, while our outdoor venue added a rustic touch. The hand sewn lace on my wedding dress inspired my bridesmaids  bouquets of soft astilbes. My dress had touches of silver beading, so I made sure to incorporate silver and gray to our wedding palette and softened it with blush colors. To highlight our outdoor summer wedding, I included sunset colored garden roses for added pops of color. I love weddings with details and personalization, so I immediately took on multiple DIY wedding projects. I spent the most time on our wedding invitations, designing different versions to set the mood for our romantic outdoor wedding. After deciding on the final design and purchasing our tools, Derek and I lovingly hand letterpressed each set of invitations. Touches of lace and ribbon and a metallic leaf-patterned envelope liner tied it all together. My other DIY projects included monogram moss letters to hang outside the garden gates, thank you cards for each place setting, a framed chalkboard seating chart, and dinner and signature drinks menus. With the help of my bridesmaids, I put together over a hundred program fans and labels for our mini wine bottle favors. Seeing everything come together on our wedding day made it all worthwhile. Our handwritten personalized vows, the wine box ceremony, our self-choreographed first dance and the DIY projects added personal touches and made our wedding day so much more special. When Derek and I finally got a chance to sit down at our sweetheart table, we took a moment to soak it all in. It was so much more than we had envisioned. The venue was gorgeous with rolling hills and lush trees, the bistro lighting added to the ambience, and the flowers were soft and dreamy. Most importantly, our closest family and friends were enjoying themselves and sharing with us one of the most important days of our lives. We cannot thank all of our vendors enough for helping us make our special day a successful one. '

S'Fold a soft color palette into an already gorgeous backdrop and it never fails to evoke all out romance. Delbarr Moradi Photography also helps. Her images are the kind we want to hang on our walls and pin feverishly to our wedding boards. We first met this duo here and now their story is coming full circle. With styling by Amanda O Shannessy Creative, florals by Huckleberry Karen Designs, and a gorgeous dessert spread by Dolce Cakes, this gallery is sure to be one of your faves.'
p2060
aS'From Amanda O Creative When I initially met with Naomi and Vic to discuss their vision for their wedding they told me the story of how they ended up dating. They were in college and had been friends for a while but secretly they both had feelings for each other. One night they both had a dream that they kissed! Eventually they told each other about these dreams and of course   started dating soon after! Their dreams, which brought them together, played such an important part of their love story that we knew we had to incorporate them into their wedding design in some way. To help create a romantic, dream-like setting we decided on lots of soft, sunset inspired colors with washes of watercolor to give the design an ethereal vibe. Romantic florals and flowing chiffon framed Naomi and Vic as they exchanged vows overlooking the golden hills of Northern California. Guests found their way to their seats by picking up escort cards which were calligraphed by Naomi s talented bridesmaid. Pieces of sea glass, which brought in a beautiful mint color, served as weights for each card and were also used as sign holders. We incorporated the same mint color and lush florals into their dessert display where a watercolor sign that read  a dream is a wish your heart makes  was framed by greenery and soft pastel flowers. The same lush, romantic pastel flowers were found in the centerpieces and bouquets where pops of gold added just a little bit of sparkle and glam to the outdoor affair.'

S'We love weddings that are full of personal touches and romantic details. This bride and groom fell in love with Big Sur, California and knew right away it was where they wanted to make it official. With the help of some awesome friends and family, Evynn Levalley, and all the loveliness that Big Sur has to offer, this wedding is definitely something to swoon over. Get lost in the dreamy gallery!'
p2107
aS'From the Bride  When my now husband and I first stood at the edge of the cliffs in Big Sur, something inside of both of us changed. It s one of those amazing places in the world where nature has formed something so dramatic, so awe-inspiring, that you feel humbled and grateful to get to experience it. More than three years later, when we got engaged and started planning our wedding, we knew that it was the perfect place for us to begin our life together as husband and wife. '
p2108
aS'Deciding to get married in Big Sur was the easy part   convincing our friends and family to fly across the country and then take a three hour drive down a winding remote highway was a bit more challenging. We were blessed that more than 25 of our closest friends and family   none of whom had ever visited Big Sur   decided to make the journey. '
p2109
aS'Because this was such a big investment for our guests, I wanted to make sure that they could soak up as much of the Big Sur spirit as possible. I made all of the invitations by hand, integrating natural wood and moss elements so from the moment they first experienced the wedding, we were starting to tell the story of the natural beauty of the area. We kept that theme going in every other printed detail   with moss and wood embellishments following through to the placecards and menus. Ripplewood Resort   where most of our guests stayed   is a quaint gathering of cottages nestled in a redwood grove along the Big Sur River, so when they arrived, these details came to life in nature. '
p2110
aS'When it came to the ceremony and reception we felt fortunate that we found an amazing team of extremely talented local vendors who ensured that every detail was 100% Big Sur and showcased the best of the area for our guests.'
p2111
aS' Our officiant, Soaring Starkey, helped us find the ideal spot for our ceremony   a tucked away clearing high in the dunes above Pfeiffer Beach, away from the wind and crowds and shadowed by towering cypress trees. While the  aisle  to get up there was a bit tenuous in heels and a long lace train, my dad handled it like a champ and our harpist, Susan Bradley, created a scene that to me, felt like it was out of a fairy tale. '
p2112
aS'Following the ceremony, we celebrated with a champagne toast with guests before our shuttle drove everyone to the Big Sur Bakery for our reception. Every detail was local   from the flowers our florist harvested from her garden to the fresh salmon that was just caught that day in the bay to fresh strawberries from a garden just down the street (which my husband kept getting bowls of all night long). The best part was that the intimate, family feel that our vendors had created translated perfectly to our guests   at the beginning of the weekend, many of them didn t know each other very well, but during the ceremony and reception, we all became a tight-knit group, on the dance floor toasting and celebrating well into the night. When it came time to leave, our guests got to take a bit of Big Sur with them, as we had custom totes designed with a map of all of our venue locations and filled it with local treats and snacks for the journey back home. It was honestly more than a wedding weekend for us   it evolved into a celebration of friendship, love and all of the natural wonder in the world. Which was beyond anything we could have ever hoped for.\n'

S'You know The Secret Garden? Well, it was one of my absolute favorite books growing up. I couldn t get enough of the enchanted mystery and believe it or not, it s exactly the inspiration behind this gorgeous shoot. Ellamah put together the abundance of blooms, The Vintage Table Co. provided the place settings, and Carolly Fine Art Photography captured the gallery just waiting to be swooned. Get started here.'
p2157
aS'From Carolly Fine Art Photography  If anyone has read the Secret Garden by Frances Burnett, I am sure they remember it very fondly. I ve had this idea to do a romantic Secret Garden shoot for a long time now, and finally gathered the perfect vendors to bring this vision to life. I still remember the way I imagined the Secret Garden   lots of greenery and flowers with brick walls surrounding it, birds everywhere, and a buried key. I wanted to photograph all these sweet, innocent elements from the book as an inspiration for brides looking to do something similar for their wedding.'
p2158
aS'Sunny Gables Estate is a relatively new wedding venue with a gorgeous stone courtyard, brick walls, and iron gates. I fell in love with it immediately once I saw how fitting it was for our romantic and intimate garden wedding. There aren t many venues like this in Los Angeles, so we were lucky to find it!'

The long and elegant Vivienne gown by BHLDN could not have been more perfect, with a silvery beaded bodice, soft cloud-grey silk tulle, and a sheer back. We adorned our bride with a set of gorgeous BHLDN crystal earrings, and a dreamy cathedral veil handmade by Veiled Beauty. Just as handsome was our groom, who wore a dapper navy blue Zara suit to complement her classic gown.'

aS'In the garden courtyard is an inviting aged wooden table with linen seating from the fabulous Found Vintage Rentals. Laid out gracefully on the table are the antique floral dinnerware, clear crystal glass, and shimmery gold flatware all curated by the Vintage Table Co. Just like the abundant blooms discovered inside the secret garden, the table is decorated with the most exquisite florals   pink peonies and roses, while draped with lots of ivy, all picked by the amazing Jessica of Ellamah Florals. Guests can also find their escort cards clipped onto the old birdcage dressed with more blossoming flowers.. And as a sweet gift, each guest receives a vintage skeleton key that unlocks the gate to the secret garden where love is being celebrated.'

aS'One of the most exciting parts of the wedding day is having cake! We loved the gorgeous rustic cake designed by the talented Leslie of Fantasy Frostings in Pasadena. This tiered cake has a very subtle hint of pink and is embellished with beautiful crafted flowers to match our theme. We all know that a wedding isn t complete without a set of invitations and gorgeous calligraphy by Nelly of Modern Elements to set the tone for a romantic secret garden wedding. Everything came together with such sweetness, elegance, and romance. Thank you to all the hard work of our vendors as well as our models Michelle and Anthony!\n'

S'This couple was inspired by Josh Ritter s song Lantern, and incorporated this into every aspect of their day. By combining California coastlines with Southern barbecue, and childhood memories with grown-up glamour, they brought a little piece of each of them to the celebration. It s a perfectly intimate affair with every moment captured by Brian Tropiano waiting for you here.'
p2198
aS'From the Bride  We wanted a very simple wedding, one in which every part of the day was something meaningful to us. So we skipped a lot of the traditional wedding formalities and opted for things that represented our families, backgrounds, and the things we care about most. Tim s dad was the pastor for our wedding, and my dad read a passage from the Velveteen Rabbit in the ceremony, a book that he often read to me and my sister when we were growing up. Because we wanted the wedding to represent both of us, we combined identities and came up with a Kentucky-Bourbon-County-meets-California-Coastal theme for the day. The ceremony was over the rocks and water in beautiful Pacific Grove, California, and we had a big Southern BBQ garden reception, complete with mac n cheese, corn hole, and even a few songs from Tim s old bluegrass band.'
p2199
aS'We also wanted our wedding to capture a promise of love, not as something that is always easy, but as something that is hard but beautiful and enough to get you through difficult times. We drew inspiration from a song by Josh Ritter called Lantern. In the first note Tim ever wrote to me, he quoted the song,  so throw away those lamentations, we both know them all too well. If there s a book of jubilations, we ll have to write it for ourselves, so come and lie beside me darling, and let s write it while we ve still got time.  We wanted our wedding to capture this idea of choosing joy and carrying lanterns for each other as we get to write the rest of our story together.'
p2200
aS'Our wedding was small and intimate, with our closest friends and family there to celebrate. It was such a wonderful experience that we ll never forget! And . the dance party was awesome.\n'

S'Whenever I come across a ballroom wedding, more specifically one filled with sleek modern details, I do a little happy dance. It s not every day we get to dive into one of these beauties after all. The all white tablescapes designed by Alexandra Kolendrianos mixed with centerpieces a ripe with tulips and succulents by Camellia Floral Design are the perfect amount of glamour. And seen through the lens of  Michael Costa? There s nothing like it!'
p2244
aS'From Michael & Anna Costa Photography Nico and Anne met in 10/2007 at Urth Cafe in Santa Monica for  coffee . Hardly an auspicious start since Anne hates Urth, and Nico hates coffee! Nevertheless, they spent the next few hours chatting on the at the beach until it was too cold to stay any longer. Luckily, Nico invited Anne to dinner to continue their chat, and later, Anne invited him to drinks. Their first date lasted about 13 hours ending in a parking ticket for Nico, which he claims he wasn t even mad about!'
p2245
aS'A few weeks later, Nico left for 6 weeks to shoot a movie in Alabama. Though Anne usually hated talking on the phone, she found herself making frequent exceptions. By the time Nico came home, they knew they were both very i interested in spending more time together, and that they had a ton in common. They both love the outdoors, Edward Abbey writings, skiing, the beach, and that Anne was going to have to get over her cell-phone phobia if this was going to work! Many years and many adventures later, Nico and Anne got engaged in April, 2012 on a camping trip in Grand Gulch National Park in Southern Utah in the pouring rain.'
p2246
aS'They started planning their wedding, and knew that they wanted a beach wedding. They had spent many  LA getaway  weekends wine tasting in the Santa Ynez valley and immediately thought of Santa Barbara. After stopping in at The Four Seasons in Montecito on a whim, they fell in love with the location, and knew that was where they would be married. It was magical! The couple have made their first home in Venice, CA, where Anne works as a physician, and Nico as a Sound Supervisor.\n'

S'When Mike Larson, Danae Grace Events, Krista Jon, Laura Hooper Calligraphy and Just Cake join forces we know we better sit down, because the pretty they produce is just knock you out of your chair gorgeous. Just take a peek below, it will have you pinning the day away, and you can get started right here. '
p2288
aS'From Danae Grace Events  This rustic grandeur shoot was the perfect style that showcased a new wedding venue, Devine Ranch. Encased by the California rolling hills and towering redwood trees, Devine Ranch s timber frame estate naturally creates a luxurious aesthetic. Using soft wood tones, and French lounge furniture, this escape turned into a romantic haven. Secluded from the rest of the world, this venue offers incredible locations for brides to get married at. As a designer, I am constantly inspired by unique design concepts and wanted to style an overall look that was not only inspiring but a statement look. We used hints of the pantone color of the year and added a lot of charm with chandeliers and exquisite accessories and dresses.'
p2289
aS'The summer tuscan wood table was full of blush vintage stemware, bright florals, and statement chairs all coming together for a romantic dine-in evening. The couture theme was interwoven in every detail from floral design by Krista Jon, and table scapes by Archive Rentals. Vintage trophies were stuffed with luscious blooms with hues of pink, purple and vibrant greens to pull in the venues equestrian flair. We used an exposed cake, which paired well with the natural texture of the mountain river rock fireplace at the estate. Every element of this shoot would be perfect for a bride looking to create a romantic setting for her wedding celebration.\n'

S'This wedding has it all. A touch of glitter, the perfect amount of gold, stripes galore, a gorgeous Bride and a handsome Groom   it s honestly overflowing with gorgeous. And thanks to the stunning images from Sorella Muse Photography, we can get lost in all the lovely here.'
p2331
aS'From Sorella Muse Photography  On July 20, 2013 Carly and Ethan said I do in front of 90 friends and family at the beautiful Memory Garden in historic downtown Monterey. '
p2332
aS'The Memory Garden is a gorgeous outdoor venue with a secluded feel, lovely flower gardens, and Southern Magnolias that act as natural arbors providing shade. Theirs was a glamorous garden wedding filled with love that took its design cues from the elegant Art Deco color palette of black, white, and gold while working in vibrant florals. It was such a fun interplay between elegant, sparkly, and organic! '
p2333
aS'What s truly amazing is just how much Carly, Ethan, and their family were able to DIY. They put so much love and care into every detail! Carly crafted the  Here Comes the Bride  sign that was held by the ring bearer, the gold jars for all the floral centerpieces, and the custom tuxedo bibs, which doubled as seating assignments when rolled up with DIY gold name tags. With help from her mom and sister, Carly also sewed the table runners, and she and her groom made the peanut brittle which served as favors, wrapped up in little striped bags at each table setting. They also hand glittered all of the table letters!'
p2334
aS'Carly and Ethan got ready at Hotel Pacific, which was just a short walk from the Memory Garden. Before arriving for their ceremony, they met in the lush Stevenson Garden, a smaller enclosed garden that was in between their hotel and the venue, for a sweetly emotional first look. Carly looked every inch the glamorous bride. Her bridal look started with a Tara Keely gown that she paired with appropriately sparkly gold shoes, and her classic updo and flawless makeup came courtesy of the girls at M.U.A.H.'
p2335
aS'After their ceremony beneath the trees, there was a festive cocktail hour complete with a taco stand and a delicious signature cocktail, followed by a barbecue style dinner prepared by Grapes of Wrath, including cornbread, salad, and much to the bride and groom s delight  an entire pig!'
p2336
aS'Later in the evening, Carly s sorority sisters sang  Oh Pat , which is sung to Kappa brides on their wedding days, and the bride and groom didn t leave the dance floor. Their party lived up to the promise of their Save the Dates which read:  Barbecue, Booze & Bad Dance Moves \n'

p2384
aS'From Mike Larson College sweethearts Jessica and Brian fell in love celebrating the holidays with their family on the shores of the lake and decided to have their gorgeous, Tuscan inspired wedding on the stunning beach of the Rubicon Bay. Set against Caribbean blue waters with their toes in the sand, the lovebirds said their I do s in front of their closest friends and family. One Fine Day Events planned and designed the wedding to incorporate simple Tuscan elegance with various accents that complimented the mountain and lakefront setting. From the cross-back wooden chairs to the lights swaying overhead amongst the trees, the setting was set for the perfect evening full of laughter and merriment. Cocktails took place amongst the towering pines with dinner hosted on the lawn overlooking the lake. Fresh baked baguettes adorned each place setting and the cream flowers were the perfect accent to the mahogany farm tables and touches of aqua. The evening ended with a cocktail bar and sweets set up on the beach, lounge furniture sprinkled throughout, and a live band for them to dance the night away!\n'

aS'From IQphoto  Elaine and Jeff met through a couple of their mutual friends what seems like eons ago. They became joined at the hip ever since the first date. It was the beginning of their lifetime journey together. They laugh, cry, go on adventures, party hard, yell and pout, throw tantrums, and cuddle with dogs together.'
p2460
aS'Unbeknownst to either of them at the time, Jeff bought the engagement ring of her dreams only a couple of days before Elaine bought the watch of his dreams, which she presented to him on their wedding day. Great minds think alike! Elaine planned a mini weekend trip to Carmel to celebrate their 3 year anniversary. Jeff sneakily planned around her plans and proposed on Carmel Beach next to the crashing waves under the cloudy starry night sky.'

S'Vintage books and pretty garland by INTHEMIX Events are just the tip of the iceberg with this winery wedding. If you peel back the layers, you ll find beautiful details hand-selected by the Bride and Groom as they spent weekends at local flea markets, choosing just the right wares for their affair. A day built around love and personalized to a t with gorgeous imagery captured by Delbarr Moradi.'
p2520
aS'From The Bride Adam and I were both extremely hands-on with planning our wedding. We wanted it to feel very intimate and personal, so we spent a lot of time picking out all the details to make it special. Sundays at the local flea markets became our usual routine, collecting everything from vintage books (I am an avid reader and lover of all things paper), to an antique inkwell and the clutch I carried on our wedding day. We also utilized etsy a lot for unique decor items. We tried to fill the space with things that we genuinely loved, not just what was  on-trend  or that had been done before. We actually now have boxes of vintage frames and books and so many other decor items we used that are now in storage because we can t fit them in our current apartment but want to have them to display in the future. Music was also a big deal to us both, so we spent a lot of one picking out songs for the various events of the day, and hand picked every song that would play during cocktail hour. We wanted the reception to be one big dance party, so we picked out a few songs that we love, but told the dj just to keep everyone dancing, which he definitely did! When our guests told us that the whole day  was so you guys , we knew we had accomplished our goal.'
p2521
aS'It was also important to us that we got to spend quality time with all of our guests. Almost every person that came was from out of state and it meant so much to us to have them there. We incorporated a whole weekend of activities for everyone to enjoy, starting with a night out near our home in San Francisco at one of our favorite bars. On Thursday (Halloween day) we all headed to Santa Rosa where we had rented a bus to take us wine tasting. Halloween is my favorite holiday, so we made it a costume optional event. I was so happy when almost every one of the 45 people showed up in costume! It was so much fun, and was a great opportunity to see everyone before the rush of the wedding day. Friday was the rehearsal dinner, which all of our guests attended.'
p2522
aS'The wedding day itself was more that we could have dreamed of. Aside from a delay in the guests  transportation, everything was perfect. To see all our hard work and planning come together was amazing. We are lucky enough to share a common group of friends and we are both very close with our families, so to look out and see all of these people we love so dearly in one room, celebrating our marriage, was so surreal. Between the two of us and all of our guests, there was so much love in the room I swear you could feel it.\n'

S'There are many perks to working in this wedding industry, but the one topping my list? The amazingly talented, creative and genuine people you meet along the way. It s people like Jacin of Lovely Little Details who never ceases to inspire, and when she shared her own anniversary sesh we kind of jumped at the chance to share. Photographed by Jessica Burke, it s one perfectly sun-kissed image after another.'

aS'From Jessica Burke One of my favorite things about my job is meeting amazing people in the wedding industry and Jacin of Lovely Little Details is no exception. Jacin and I worked one of our very first weddings together   which became our first feature on Style Me Pretty   and have been close friends since! When she told me she was moving to Atlanta, I immediately thought of photographing her and her little fam here in California to commemorate their time here. The rolling hills of the Bay Area are just so beautiful, and I was happy to have the chance to document these memories for them to look back on for years to come!\n'

S'Jessica Burke is an office favorite here at SMP and her pretty, pretty images are a major reason why. The light, the emotion, the sheer beauty of a wedding all wrapped up in photographs that double as art; it s enough to make anyone fall hard. And her latest installment, which started with this pretty engagement, is filled with wildly elegant al fresco details crafted by Trisha Dean Events and pastel blooms by Michael Daigian Design. Have a look at the full day unfold here.'
p2653
aS'From The Bride  Clear to anyone that knows me, I am definitely a planner. Lucky for me, Chris and I had a 16 month engagement (due to the popularity of the Mission at Santa Clara). This allowed lots of time to articulate every detail of our wedding. I used the beautiful weddings shown on Style Me Pretty and created a Pinterest account solely to help plan our wedding.'
p2654
aS'My mom and I flew to Monique Lhuillier in Los Angeles on a few occasions. I kept debating on a dress and worked with their associates to re-design one of my favorites to become my dream dress. My dress was a labor of love. I didn t see the final dress until I put it on, on my wedding day. Jessica Burke s beautiful photography captured the moment perfectly.'
p2655
aS'We wanted our wedding to be traditional, classic and beautiful. We both attended Santa Clara University, so getting married at the Mission was an obvious choice. The Adobe Lodge was the only reception venue we looked at. We loved the idea that our guests could walk straight from the ceremony to cocktail hour in the beautiful mission gardens.'
p2656
aS'With 16 months to plan, and Trisha Deans help, we found the perfect group of vendors who helped us craft the vision of our wedding. Kerry at Olive and Emerald did an amazing job producing the color palette and theme for our wedding. Her designs became the inspiration for our flowers and linens, provided by Michael Daigian Design and La Tavola Linens. The banana cake from Icing on the Cake was a childhood favorite of ours, our guests must have also enjoyed it because there was not a slice left! I worked at The Creamery in Palo Alto for many years and they were kind enough to provide the whoopie pies for our wedding favors. In an ode to Chris s favorite meal, we served grilled cheese and tater tots for our late night snack.'
p2657
aS'The weather could not have been more perfect for our outdoor July wedding. The backdrop of the Mission and historic olive trees provided the serene and intimate feeling that we were hoping to achieve. Jessica s photography highlighted everything we loved about the most memorable day of our lives.'

S'I am a self-confessed brunch addict. Mimosas, cappuccinos and pancakes by the stack  just where I want to be on a lazy sunday. Now fold all of that goodness into the prettiest Marvimon House wedding crafted by Pluck and coordinated by WINK! It s a day that brunch dreams are made of and one that finds guests with tambourines in their hands and pancakes in their bellies. See it all captured by onelove photography right here.'
p2705
aS'From WINK! The bride and groom are lovers of Los Angeles. They incorporated their love of: brunch, Dodgers Baseball, Bicycles, and Coffee. Featuring a bona-fide  cereal bar  and pumpkin pancakes! Their bridal party serenaded them live to  Hey! Ho!  for their processional with adorable handmade signs. '
p2706
aS'From The Bride We actually built our wedding backwards. We started with planning the most basic option (the two of us, in jeans, at the courthouse) and from there, we began adding back in the things we would miss if we did that simple scenario (having our friends and family there, etc.) It was interesting to discover the things that ended up mattering to us (I had no idea, until then, that I cared about wearing a white dress or having an aisle to walk down). Turned out, both of us wanted more of a wedding-type wedding than either of us expected. We just wanted to make sure that everything we did, we did because we wanted to, not because we were supposed to. And, we wanted to do it our way. It was so much more fun and liberating, then, to go through and put our signature on each of the elements we kept.'
p2707
aS'D cor was a huge part of the experience we wanted to create. Most of our friends and family are scattered all over, so our time together with them has been limited and their knowledge of our relationship has been based on the cliff notes versions we ve given them over phone calls and Skype. We wanted to create a sort of museum experience in the space- a walk through the history of Chase and Tami, if you will. We incorporated artifacts from our relationship into the displays and we took advantage of each element to tell a story about us. Instead of a standard dinner, we designed a unique brunch since that s our favorite meal. Instead of a full bar, we had a bubble bar and then added the Handsome Roasters coffee cart, because coffee (and Handsome, in particular) has been a huge part of our relationship. The table themes were inspired by our adventures together. Our refrigerator at home is covered in photo strips from every booth we ve ever encountered, so we rented a photo booth. We created encyclopedia entries (a reference to my Match.com profile, where Chase first  met  me), which served as mini story captions to explain the significance of each piece. We really wanted the whole day to be interactive and for our guests to participate in the celebration instead of just sitting down and watching everything happen from their various assigned seats.'
p2708
aS'Anything else you want to share with other brides about what you learned while planning your wedding?'
p2709
aS'1. Everyone tells you that your wedding day will go by fast. But it goes by even faster than you imagine when someone tells you how fast it goes. Create an instagram hashtag and encourage your guests to use it- even starting with the beginning of their day leading up to the wedding. There are also tons of apps and websites your guests can use to upload and share their photos and videos. It s so much fun to go through and re-live your day that way and experience it through your guests  lenses.\n 2. Make sure that the two of you are at the heart of everything. This is just one of the hundreds of amazing days you re going to spend together. It s really easy to lose that perspective in such an overwhelming process, but that simple reminder always seemed to take a huge amount of pressure off and bring the fun of it back in.\n'

S'I m not really sure where to begin with this slice of pretty. It is literally packed with so much goodness. A few (or maybe five) notables, rapid fire? The Bride s two pairs of pink shoes, her gorge Romona Keveza dress, the insane private estate: Il Palazzo Mansion, the golden details and the first dance serenaded by the Bride s very own sister. It s dreamy to say the least and Onelove Photography snapped it all up here.'
p2772
aS'From the beautiful Bride Like most girls, my wedding day was something I had dreamed about my entire life. But never in my wildest dreams could I have ever imagined  our  wedding day. After nearly eight years together, I finally walked down the aisle towards the love of my life and my best friend. I was 20 years old when I met Aaron (he was 28), and I knew the moment I met him that, in every sense of the word, I would grow old with him one day.'
p2773
aS'Aaron proposed when the clock struck midnight on New Year s Eve. New Year s Eve has always been an important day to my family and I, as it is also my parents  wedding anniversary, and it made it that much more special that not only will we continue to celebrate the love that my parents still have for one another, but now the day that he and I became engaged!'
p2774
aS'When it came to planning our wedding, we immediately began to look at private estates. We knew we wanted the day to be intimate and private. Il Palazzo was the first venue that we looked at. I knew from the pictures online that it was exactly what we were looking for, and when we finally walked through the front doors of that home, we were absolutely blown away. My favorite part, by far, was the 36-foot tall ceilings and crystal chandeliers hanging from nearly every room s ceiling throughout. I knew we would never find anything else like it. The estate truly is as magnificent as it is grand. The 36,000 square foot estate sits on a hilltop overlooking the ocean on nearly two acres. It s unbelievable to think that we didn t even monopolize half of the home the day of our wedding!'
p2775
aS'Once we secured the venue, finding the perfect dress came just as easily. I knew from the getgo that I wanted my wedding dress to have sleeves. I ve always been inspired by iconic brides in history   from Grace Kelly to Kate Middleton   and I couldn t have found a more perfect dress than the Romona Keveza gown that I walked down the aisle in. It was the first wedding dress that I tried on, and I knew from the moment I took one look at those beautiful lace sleeves that that was MY wedding dress.'
p2776
aS'Aaron and I knew that we wanted to do our wedding big and beautiful and glamorous. It was our wedding day, and we wanted to do it big! We wanted it to have that black-tie affair feel, but also to come across very simple and soft at the same time. We kept it soft with the ivory, dove gray, and blush tones. We incorporated hints of gold in our smallest details, like the skeleton key bottle opener place card holders and tiny table details.'
p2777
aS'Getting ready with all my girls was one of the best parts of the day. Our venue had a beautiful bridal suite with light lavender walls and white furniture. It was there that 7 of my best friends, my sister (and maid of honor), and my mom, got ready on the day of the wedding. It was such a relaxed and fun environment. We laughed and played music and danced. One of my best friends (and bridesmaid) Mattison, did my hair (and pretty much everyone else s) the day of the wedding. It was so much fun, because it felt like just another day with the girls.'
p2778
aS'Although it would be so hard to pick my favorite moment of the day, nothing stands out more to me than my little sister, Jamie, singing the song for my and Aaron s first dance. Hearing my sister belt out  At Last  by Etta James as Aaron and I danced our first dance as husband and wife was the most magical moment of my life. The way her beautiful voice echoed throughout that house had everyone in tears. I will never, ever forget that moment.'
p2779
aS'We couldn t have found a more perfect person to photograph our wedding. Sara from onelove photography was a dream come true! The moment I stumbled upon her website, I could not stop looking at all the weddings she had photographed. Sara captured the essence of our day and of who we are as a couple perfectly. Aaron and I love nothing more than to laugh with one another, and the happiness we felt that day is so obvious in every image. We smiled all day long, and it was a day full of love, joy, and so much laughter. It really was the happiest day of our lives.\n'

S'Any gathering of girlfriends is a perfect celebration in my book, but when it comes in the form of a lush, garden bridal shower styled to a T? Well, let s just say we couldn t share this beauty fast enough. Designed by Twine Events with calligraphy from Curlicue Designs, it s a feminine twist on the al fresco luncheon, and Lavender & Twine captured every last bit. Enjoy!'
p2810
aS'From Twine Events The day before the wedding, the bride and her sister hosted a bridal shower luncheon. It was a time to gather all the girls, get them excited about the big day and say thank you for flying in and celebrating. San Ysidro Ranch is a magical little gem that holds pockets of spaces for you to get lost in. It is also where the wedding is going to be the next day, so it was a great idea to show off the Ranch to the gals. The wine cellar patio was perfect spot to host the shower luncheon. We played off the lush garden atmsophere with a garland runner and added pops of purple blooms (a color the bride loves). '
p2811
aS'A little indoor lounge area was created for any ladies to beat the heat. It was gorgeous, yet very sunny day but to these Texan ladies, it was perfect and not too hot at all. The food was served family style and integrated fresh vegetables and herbs from the Ranch s personal garden. She also wanted to include pops of the unexpected and fun elements for the ladies. '
p2812
aS'While the luncheon was for the bride, the bride wanted to make sure her ladies were showered just as much. We created a flower station for the ladies to pick up a flower crown or hair clip to wear during the event. It was also a chance to make them feel girly and play dress up.To make them feel extra special, we set personalized ribbon calligraphy place cards for them to keep. The ladies even made fabulous bracelets out of them. It also helps it was one stylish group of ladies!\n'

S'Lavender fields, gorgeous California light, a stylish (and super in love) couple   I m pretty sure that is the perfect recipe for a perfect wedding. Sprinkle in some gorgeous design and florals by Poppy & Plum and absolutely gorgeous photography by Ryon:Lockhart Photography, and we are left with a gallery too good to miss. See it all here.'
p2850
aS'Five minutes into walking the 2,200 acre grounds of Highland Springs Resort, we knew we had to marry under the Olive Groves and walk the lavender fields together. About an hour outside of Los Angeles, our family and friends would stay in the rustic cottages on the property and our wedding would feel like a wedding weekend, and not just a one night event. The sunset would be magical and the lavender would be beginning to bloom. And to satisfy the hippie in me, our guests would eat delicious farm-to-table meals. To me, the grounds were peaceful and romantic, just like Bryan. '
p2851
aS'On the morning of the wedding day, my bridesmaids and I had a relaxing breakfast before getting ready, while the boys took turns throwing each other into the pool. And as I got ready, I watched the amazing girls of Poppy & Plum set up and decorate the grounds. The white lanterns hanging in the wedding tent were turned on, and the tables beautifully decorated with white and blush flowers, gold mercury glass candles, and lavender-filled sachets (made by my grandmother) placed at each table setting. I loved how the rectangular tables outlined the dance floor. The finishing touch was the lawn games our guests would play during cocktail hour which included homemade corn hole toss boards and hula hooping.'
p2852
aS'The day, and really the entire weekend, was perfect! The weather was warm with a nice breeze, my uncle Howard delivered the most honest and genuine ceremony, and our family and friends danced, ate cake and danced some more. Our wedding was exactly what we had envisioned I felt the most beautiful I have ever felt, our vows were personal and our ceremony intimate, and our family and friends spent the weekend together celebrating us.\n'

S'The way this Bride talks about her beau (now husband), is terribly sweet and melts my heart. From the moment they met at summer camp to building a strong friendship to the perfectly planned proposal and a blossoming love, which is so apparent in the stunning imagery from B. Schwartz Photography. You ll want to carve out a good chunk of you afternoon for this lovely my dears.'
p2892
aS'From the beautiful Bride Kyle and I met when I was just about to begin my sophmore year of high school, and he was about to begin his junior year. We met at summer camp, Hume Lake Christian camp, to be specific! I remember being out in the middle of the lake with some girls in my cabin when we met. I even remember the exact shirt he was wearing. Haha. After camp, we found each other on MySpace and begin building a friendship from that point on. He quickly became my best friend. I was so impressed by how easy he was to talk to, how much he made me laugh, and how absolutely different he was to me than any other guy I had met. Living 6 hours away at the time, we would stay up late nights skyping and talking on the phone. We could talk for hours and hours. It was hard to ever say goodbye or goodnight. After a couple years of building a solid friendship, we always knew we had feelings for each other but didn t know how the long distance would work. We decided in February of 2011 to give it a shot and  officially  date. We remained long distance for about 10 months, taking multiple trips back and forth to see each other. In January of 2012, Kyle moved up by me to join the local Fire Academy. He ended up living with my brother and his wife for about 6 months during academy, then got his own place. He stayed up here ever since! The rest is history. I married my best friend, my complete answer to prayer.'
p2893
aS'Kyle took me to the place where we had our first date, up on a hill top overlooking beautiful Laguna Niguel. The view was breathtaking and brought back memories of the first date we spent together 3 years prior. To my knowledge, I thought we were just going on a walk like we had done the first time, little did I know he had much more planned. When we reached the peek, he got down on one knee and popped the question! The ring was stunning, I couldn t believe it was mine! I remember asking him   this is mine?!  His brother was hiding in the bushes capturing the whole moment! It gets even better  Our families live 6 hours apart, so I was a little bummed knowing I would have to wait a few days to see my mom and sisters. The first chance I got, I called my mom to share in the excitement! Kyle told me that we would be going to dinner with his parents but we needed to stop by his house first. When we arrived, I was surprised by so many of his friends and family all cheering for us when we walked in. I still tear up thinking about it. As I walk further in the house admiring the beautiful decorations that his mom and my sister-in-law, Whitney put together, I hear my dad s voice! I turn around and see my dad, mom and sister standing there. I immediately dropped to the ground. I was so overwhelmed with joy, something I have never in my life felt. Before we got engaged Kyle knew the only 2 things I really wanted was pictures of the moment and to share in the excitement afterward with family and friends. He definitely went above and beyond what I could of ever imagined!'
p2894
aS'Our first look was our favorite wedding moment. Definitely. Seeing each other for the first time, spending those first moments together, knowing what was about to happen, was indescribable. It was a crazy feeling knowing it was REALLY happening. Not to mention he looked so handsome.\n'

aS'From Blue Kite Cinema Lindsay + Alex were so much fun- from the moment we got to the hotel and Lindsay called us saying,  get up here, let s get this party started  to the photo session at Union Station in LA when Alex was holding the photo light and playfully shining it at Lindsay, we were laughing the whole time. The ceremony was laid out  in the round  at the Cicada Club which was a very different way to capture their special moments and made for some awesome footage. And the best part of the story is that we got to do something a bit different with them. We had Lindsay s three kids and her niece help narrate the story of Lindsay + Alex. It is absolutely adorable. I guess kids really do  say the darndest things . Watch and see!\n'

Second, Amari Productions. They are amazing. They captured this couples  stunning day with such heart you can feel it, and when you hit play, you ll see just what I mean '

p3008
aS'An hour or so later we pulled up to Kelsey and Joel s respective getting ready locations. It was still raining, albeit lightly at the moment. (Now, if at this point in the story you re fidgeting anxiously in your chair trying to pray away the rain, know that we were feeling very much the same thing.) So I, Dave, walk into Joel s house, whilst Mariah walks into Kelsey s hotel room. And what do we find? The most pure, unadulterated joy. These two were about to marry the love of their life, and that was ALL. THAT. MATTERED.'
p3009
aS'Hell yes.'
p3010
aS'By the way, it turns out Mother Nature has a soft spot for true love. Because as we left for the venue not only did the rain stop, the clouds literally parted and the sun came out. It was like that scene from Land Before Time when they find the Great Valley. The soundtrack from the movie might have even been playing as it happened, or maybe that was just in my head.'
p3011
aS'Either way, the day turned out to be everything these two deserved, and we were SO STOKED to be able to be show this Same Day Premiere at the end of the night.\n'

p3055
aS'Jennifer had her favorite movie, The Great Gatsby (1974 version)with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford in mind, when she decided to recreate her own understated rustic elegant wedding in Malibu, California s, Saddlerock Ranch. Surrounded by a breathtaking backdrop of mountain tops and livestock, Jennifer and Brian celebrated their nuptials in the company of 130 of their closest family and friends. Guests were treated to the festive feel of an elegant outdoor party complete with black tie attire, dance floor lighting, furniture vignettes, and a big band.'
p3056
aS'Arriving guests were greeted by either bubbling champagne, or refreshing lemonade served in mini mason jars complete with striped straws. Proceeding to the spacious grassy ceremony area decorated with 2 white urns overflowing with floral arrangements, guests took their rustic soft wood seats. The groom and groomsmen looked dashing in classic black tuxedos. The lovely bridesmaids were escorted down the aisle dressed in beautiful blush colored dresses. The beautiful bride, accompanied by her father, was adorned in an exquisite one shoulder gown. Guests watched the bride and groom recite their vows while framed in a mirror outlined in greenery and florals.'
p3057
aS'Following the ceremony, guests gathered for the cocktail hour listening to a Jazz Band, sipping on signature cocktails and dining on delicious oysters on the half shell. Shortly thereafter, all made their way down the path to the Main House for the reception which was decorated with wooden rectangular tables complete with burlap runners and silver charger plates. Soft candlelight surrounded a variety of antique urns filled with gorgeous pastel garden roses, dahlia s and olive sprigs gracing the center of each table.'
p3058
aS'Guests danced the night away to the 12 piece big band under a canopy of twinkling custom lights. Not only did they enjoy a delicious vanilla wedding cake covered with fresh flowers, but they also dined on a gorgeous dessert display featuring macaroons, fruit tarts and freshly made chocolate chip cookies.'

S'This open-air, mountaintop fete from Larissa Cleveland Photography makes me want to stretch my arms wide and take in all the love. It s quirky, it s cute, and it s surely full of pure romance. Layered in are wildflowers serving as the sweetest splash of color, views that ll stop you in your tracks, a wide-eyed happy horse and one of the cutest Bride & Grooms I ever did see.'

aS'From Larissa Cleveland Photography .A few fun details:\n   Guests wore 1930 s inspired attire.\n   The ceremony took place on the top of a mountain! The location hand picked by the bride and groom.\n   Reception was at horse stable at the base of the mountain.\n   During the ceremony they incorporated elements of a Native American tradition by burning sage and using feathers to bless each other.\n   The guests were given tambourines for when the bride and groom excited the ceremony.

S'This wedding had me at pink. And then the palms, the happy blooms from Lovely Stems Floral, the dresses (all of them) and the smiles? Well lets just say it all swept me right off my feet.

aS'From the beautiful Bride After Joey and I got engaged in the midst of a sweltering summer season, I knew that I wanted to plan an early spring wedding. This is my favorite time of the year because plants begin to bloom and the weather warms up. Spring is also the same time of the year when Joey and I went on our first date. He planned a simple date hiking up Palomar Mountain. On this day, the mountain side was sprinkled with yellow and orange wild flowers, and wispy green grass. It was this image and many more similar memories with Joey that inspired my wedding style. Joey and I wanted an informal, garden wedding with bright colors. We wanted to share our love for the outdoors with our friends and family. We picked the San Diego Botanic Gardens as our venue for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. It provided the perfect backdrop for a garden inspired wedding with flower, bird, and wood details. Since gardens are filled with various flora, I chose the color coral to broaden the color scheme. D cor and flowers ranged from pink to orange, with hits of blue to add contrast. '

S'It s no hard task to get lost in these dreamy images from Koman Photography, but after hearing what the lovely photographer had to say about the day, the images take on a whole different meaning. The garden party soiree is romantic as can be, and I absolutely implore you to read the story below, and then revisit every single image   just make sure to grab the tissue box first!'
p3226
aS'From the Bride  I am an artist and can tend to be a perfectionist when I have a vision of how I want something to look aesthetically, so the biggest thing for me was starting to trust in other people to create my specific vision for me. As the bride, I quickly learned that I was not going to be able to do everything myself, especially the day of. I never knew what to say when I was asked  what is your theme?  I guess our wedding had a vibe. I knew I wanted everyone to dress up, maybe a little more fancy than usual. I pictured this fantastic garden party from another era with tons of twinkly lights, soft yet dramatic elements, organic tablescapes, mixed with 1950 s prom decor? That is how my mind works. The most overwhelming aspect of wedding planning, aside from the saving money, and making decisions part, are the endless options out there! The wiser women in my life kept reminiscing on how there were no options back in the day as to how you executed your wedding. Well, the modern day bride is faced with so many options, it can seriously drive one mad! I had to narrow my likes down and I decided to focus on one big decor element that I knew I could make and afford. That element was the ribbon garland that hung above the dance floor. Andrew and I LOVE to dance and it was imperative that we spent the entire night dancing with friends and family. I wanted to create a magical atmosphere on that dance floor. After I focused on that, everything began to fall into place. I wasn t afraid to scour craigslist ads, and borrow decor from family friends. Andrew was such a huge help as well. He was constantly in touch with vendors, making decisions with me, and really being present in the entire experience. I absolutely loved our wedding!'

S'Shades of pink  that is our love language. And these bright, blushing centerpieces by Fujii Florist are speaking right to our classic loving souls. They are wrapped up in a day so timeless and perfect with a Bride in a Reem Acra gown worthy of a good old-fashioned swoonfest and photographs that only Tanja Lippert could capture so perfectly. Catch all the pink, all the sparkly, all the love right here.'
p3284
aS'From The Groom Lauren and I met in high school in California when we were both sixteen   me at an all-boys Catholic prep and she at the all-girl sister school. We shared a love of the outdoors, politics, and dinners at Pasta Pomodoro. Four proms, a long-distance college relationship, and one cross-country move later, our taste in restaurants has improved but the interests, good times, and respect for one another that initially brought us together remains the same.'
p3285
aS'Although we now call Atlanta home, we re both Californians at heart so we knew the wedding would be back in the Bay Area, near many of our friends and family. Neither Lauren nor I consider ourselves sentimental people, but we couldn t help but appreciate the beauty of choosing Stanford s church as our ceremony venue   in addition to being Lauren s alma mater (and home to my favorite college football team), her parents had gotten married there on the same date in August 37 years earlier.'
p3286
aS'The rest of our wedding planning followed naturally. We wanted the day to be beautiful and timeless, but also to really focus on the things that Lauren and I cared about most: friends and family, drinks and dancing, and amazing food! We were planning from afar so we made most of our decisions during a weeklong, whirlwind wedding trip during the winter holidays (and had lots of help from some amazing people). Our reception venue was a beautiful private home and garden, just minutes from the church, that had exactly the comfortable elegance we were looking for. Since we both seriously lack any artistic talent, we found other ways to add our own personal touches to the reception: a shuck-to order oyster bar (hands down my favorite food), personalized appetizers (fish n  chips and crabcakes, reminiscent of our many trips to Barbara s Fishtrap in nearby Half Moon Bay), a string quartet to play during the cocktail hours (one of our first dates was at the San Francisco Symphony), and his and her signature cocktails (Lauren s classic French 75 and my dirty martini). Our flowers were done by a florist Lauren s family has known since she was a child. We met with them six weeks before the wedding, described our color scheme and gave them free-reign with the design and were amazed at how perfectly everything turned out.'
p3287
aS'The wedding day itself was warm, sunny and like the past ten years we d spent together (and hopefully the next 50 to come) was filled with more love and laughter than we ever could have dreamed. Lauren was stunningly beautiful and her smile and grace made me fall in love all over again. It was perfect.\n'

S'As a Bride-to-be with a military fianc  myself, this wedding from Heidi-O-Photo hit my heart in just the right spot. With their venue chosen and deposit made, these two lovebirds got the news that the Groom would be deploying a mere two weeks before their set date, but they didn t let that stop them. They whipped up this absolutely gorgeous day in just five months it s heartwarming, to say the least.'
p3328
aS'From Heidi-O-Photo Sarah & Bud recently moved from the East Coast to San Diego and chose the Darlington House for their wedding. All their friends and family traveled to California for the wedding.'
p3329
aS'Sarah chose the wedding colors to go well with the Darlington House and it s decor.'
p3330
aS'From the beautiful Bride We came very close to having an entirely different wedding. So close in fact that we had made a deposit at a vineyard in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains and started planning our wedding in our hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia. That is, until Bud checked into his duty station at Camp Pendleton and was informed that he would be deployed to Afghanistan two weeks before our scheduled wedding. After weighing all our options, we decided it was most important to us that we were married before he deployed and that we would be able to share that day with our friends and families. That left us a five month window to plan an event in a place we had only lived for a matter of weeks.'
p3331
aS'The Darlington House was the only venue we toured in San Diego. We were immediately attracted to the history and intimate feel, and could not help but feel at home in a place that still felt very foreign. As essentially all of our guests were coming in from out of town, we wanted a space that would allow us to visit with them personally and that would showcase the unique style of Southern California. We also decided to include a few reminders of home, like the collection of family wedding photos to honor everywhere we ve come from, and the selection of pies it could not be a real Southern party without. We relied very heavily on recommendations from our vendors to build a wonderfully experienced team that made our wedding feel both like us and iconically Southern Californian.'
p3332
aS'Many of our friends and family took our wedding as an opportunity to vacation in San Diego for the week, but due to their military obligations, Bud s friends could not and the last of his friends did not arrive until 1 AM the morning of the wedding. Finally having everyone there was this immense feeling of relief and set an amazing tone of celebration and reunion for the event the next day. It was very important to Bud that we incorporate some military traditions into our wedding, such as the sword arch and cutting of the cake with his mameluke, the Marine Corps officers  sword. Like the traditional vows we made, said by our parents and grandparents before us, these traditions have been a special connection to the larger Marine Corps family we have both decided to join, through good times and bad.\n'

S'A rainy day wedding sometimes calls for plan B and can make an otherwise calm, cool and collected Bride a bit frazzled. But we promise, it can be gorgeous. Those gray skies make the green garlands by Botanica Events By Audrey Chaney pop a little brighter. And who doesn t love the perfect kissing shot under an umbrella? A quick peek at this backyard affair so perfectly captured by Milou & Olin and you ll agree.'
p3392
aS'From The Bride Al swept me off my feet from day one and just a year after we first met I was thrilled to say  yes  when he asked me to marry him! As two busy entrepreneurs however, we both knew we needed to find someone extraordinary who could worry about the details for us while staying in line with our specific vision, and still manage to keep us a part of the process. After meeting wedding planner Lorena Molina we knew she was the fairy godmother to our Cinderella story.'
p3393
aS'We scoured the state for wedding locations, but as we walked the grounds of my parent s home one sunny afternoon we realized that getting married there   surrounded by so many wonderful memories of time spent with family and friends  was the perfect place to commit to one another and begin our life together.'
p3394
aS'My good friend Liza at Bride s by Liza took my wedding dress inspiration    a photo of dress worn by an SMP bride from Australia   and turned it into reality with flowing chiffon, French lace, and delicate beading. After weeks of fittings it was perfect. I couldn t wait for my soon-to-be husband to see it. Al had his suit custom made by his suit maker, Jonathan Behr in Los Angeles. There was something about having bespoke clothing made for our wedding day that made it an extra special experience as we watched our vision take shape (literally!) before our eyes.'
p3395
aS'We re foodies at heart and from the start envisioned a farm to table dinner party where locally sourced ingredients could take center stage.  The family style meal was the result of the talented hands behind Magpie Catering who whipping up some of the most scrumptious fare we had ever tasted. Wine from our favorite local vineyard just a stone s throw away from the venue was flowing all night along with locally brewed Ale and IPA.'
p3396
aS'On the day of the wedding we couldn t stop smiling   or kissing!  We were so in love and beyond excited to spend the rest of our lives together. A string quartet played Pachelbel s Cannon as I walked down the aisle. I could see the tears welling up in Al s eyes as he watched me walk towards him   I fell in love with him all over again in that moment. We chose to use the beautiful, old wedding vows found in the Book of Common Prayer dating back to the 16th century and one of my mentors, Bob Litchfield, performed the ceremony.'
p3397
aS'Great live music was a must for us and the Speakeasies from San Francisco hit it out of the park with their boisterous renditions of classic big band era jazz. The guests were dancing to the tunes of Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole into the wee hours of the night.'
p3398
aS'We were blown away by the beautiful images captured by the Milou + Olin team    they were such a pleasure to work with! Securing an amazing photographer was without a doubt one of the best decisions we made throughout the planning process!'
p3399
aS'Overall the weekend was extraordinary; our team of vendors executed a flawless event complete with amazing food, lively music, natural beauty, and an abundance of elegance. Our guests felt cared for and the entire weekend was effortless.  We so enjoyed spending time with our family and friends who traveled from far and near to celebrate with us   we love you all!\n'

p3426
aS'From Nudrat Owens Photography  Lindsey and Adam s summer wedding in San Francisco was done in Sex and the City Style.The ceremony was held at the SF City Hall. The couple reserved the Mayor s Balcony for the event. The amazing view of the Balcony from across the hall was simply stunning. Lindsey and Adam shared some intimate moments while waiting in line for their marriage certificate near the city Clerk s office and then headed to the balcony for the ceremony where their close friends and family awaited. They took the vows in front of their most loved ones. Champaign and cupcakes were the perfect way to cheer to a toast.\n'
p3427
aS'In contrast to traditional white gown, Lindsey chose a cream-beige-knee-length dress for her wedding. The dress was from Bloomingdales NY, NY. Loved the blue shoes on her. Adam matched his tie and socks with Lindsey s shoes. '
p3428
aS'The reception was held at the Modernism Gallery in Foreign Cinema on Mission, SF. What a cool venue for a cozy reception! And the food was to die for! Lindsey s bouquet was made of her Grandmother s favorite flower  Pink Ice  Protea. The heirloom necklace from her Grandmother was passed on to Lindsey that she crowned her bouquet with. Clearly her grandmother was very near and dear to her heart. Gorgeous floral design by Natalie Bowen Designs were the jewels on every table at the reception hall. Adam, the groom, made all the table signs himself. He played with metal and a solder gun to create the  A-heart-L  sign for the head table too. Lindsey and her mom made Apricot Jam as favors for all guests. They had a very personal and beautiful story tied to that as well.'

aS'Back to back movies were played all night at the Modernism gallery.  Food and Film  was definitely the vibe going throughout the night. The couple share Italian heritage;  Mangia , meaning  eat , on the menu was totally appropriate.\n\nThis wedding was so elegantly styled. The couple s simple yet sophisticated ideas were a perfect representation of their personalities. We don t get to photograph such weddings everyday. It was totally  Sex and the City  of San Francisco.\n'

S'As a self-proclaimed perfectionist that thrives off of stress-induced work, this Bride was inevitably meant to plan a beyond beautiful soiree. And that she did. Calamigos Ranch set the stage for every lovely moment captured by Koman Photography, including the Bride s not one, but TWO gorgeous dresses from Beautiful Day Wedding, the prettiest twinkling bloom-covered ceremony ever, a fun taco truck and so much more.'
p3492
aS'From Koman Photography  We cannot say enough great things about Brooke and Andrew! Spending time with them is like enjoying great moments with old friends. These two are always smiling and enjoying life, it is truly a joy to see them interacting with each other. We are truly happy to have been given the chance to get to know them during their Engagement journey and now through their marriage. Their engagement session was one we will never forget and their Wedding Day at the Calamigos Ranch was perfect!'
p3493
aS'From the beautiful Bride  For anyone that knows me personally, they will know that I am a perfectionist that thrives off of stress-induced work so planning a wedding was right up my aisle. Andrew and I had been dating for 9 years when we got engaged on a beach while on vacation in Maui. He planned the proposal perfectly by asking me as the sun was setting on a beautiful cliff by the beach and even hired a photographer to capture the entire proposal. It was truly a magical day that I will never forget. Shortly after the proposal, Andrew and I were on the hunt for the perfect venue and found ourselves at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, CA where we chose the Fourth of July as the date to tie the knot. It was the perfect date because we envisioned a night of celebration, happiness, and fireworks! '
p3494
aS'For the theme, we chose a whimsical, shabby chic style so that we could highlight the beautifully rustic feel of the venue. The color scheme was light pink, cream, and gold, which complemented the natural earthy tones that the venue already provided. During the planning process, our main objective was to create an atmosphere at our wedding that accurately portrayed our own personal styles and interests. We took on many DIY projects in order to accomplish this task. To highlight Brooke s love of sweets, we set up a candy bar and dessert bar with customized mason jars for guests to fill. For Andrew s love of Mexican food, we set up a Mexican taco stand following dinner for guests to enjoy throughout the night. All of these things created a wedding that really felt like our own and the beautiful photos by John and Marlene captured every key moment.\n'

aS'From The Bride Paul and I dated for two years after having met ten years earlier through a mutual friend. We d both been living in San Francisco after spending a few years in New York City and finally the timing was right for both of us, after just one official date it was clear to both of us that this was the real thing!'
p3538
aS'I grew up in Northern Virginia but we both knew we wanted to get married in the Bay Area. We loved spending weekends in Napa Valley and the wine country was our first choice. We also knew we wanted a summer wedding. As soon as we visited Solage Calistoga we knew it couldn t get any better. It was important to us that the weekend be as hassle free and luxurious as possible for our friends and family who were coming from all over the world. We wanted a venue with a fantastic restaurant, beautiful outdoor and indoor event space, luxury service for our guests and amazing pool and spa   it was perfect! Our decision to work with Stacy McCain Events was the best decision we made, Stacy and her team created our dream wedding and made the entire process seamless and smooth. We were thrilled to secure the band Wonderbread 5 for the reception and probably would have missed out on them if it weren t for Stacy.'
p3539
aS'We started the weekend with a beautiful and laid back outdoor rehearsal dinner at Gott s in St. Helena which was a perfect kick off to a wine country weekend. Paul s 11 year old nephew, Luke Kennedy, gave a surprise toast that moved everyone to tears, it was such a special moment for us! Afterwards we invited all of the guests who were in town to a cocktail reception by the pool at Solage. The setting was so lovely and in addition to being the day of summer solstice there was a glowing  Supermoon , the largest full moon of the year, shining down on the festivities.'
p3540
aS'We loved our officiant, Rev. Peadar Dalton, a friend of Paul s parents, he was terrific! We both come from Irish families and Rev. Dalton has a charming Irish brogue which was a big hit with everyone. He was warm and gracious and included our parents in a very sweet blessing of the rings. We wrote our own vows and it was so sweet to recite them in front of our loved ones. Our wedding parties included our nieces and nephews and our treasured terrier, Archibald. The ceremony was outside on the lawn and our pianist played  Imagine  by John Lennon while the flower girls and our nephews walked down the aisle, it was one of my favorite moments of the day. Walking down the aisle with my Dad to  Hallelujah  by Leonard Cohen played on the piano was a moment I ll never forget. Paul and I were so moved by all of the toasts that day as well, our friends and families words meant so much to us. We chose the song  If I Should Fall Behind  by Bruce Springsteen, one of our favorite musicians, for our first dance and it was so perfect!'
p3541
aS'We were blown away by the beautiful and fun pictures Sasha Gulish captured, she was fantastic to work with, our guests kept telling us how much they loved her and her team. Anna Hoffman of Loop Flowers & Events did an absolutely gorgeous job, the arrangements and displays throughout the weekend were stunning. The  altar  was a simple circle of white rose petals and it looked so sweet against the naturally beautiful backdrop of the Palisades. Our niece Isla couldn t resist wandering in and out of the circle throughout the ceremony, it was so cute! Our extraordinary team of vendors, thanks to Stacy, flawlessly executed our unforgettable, romantic, summery and fun weekend that we had been dreaming of. We left for our honeymoon so thankful and in awe of all of the love in our lives. To our delight, we re now proud parents of Colin James Kennedy, born April 5, 2014!\n'

And if you happen to be wearing a gorgeous gown and having all of the festivities captured by K Stone Photography; then it s even better. Have a look at this day planned by Marisa Nicole Events along with blooms by Valley Flora that really celebrates the true beauty of a wedding   love, family and amazing wine pairings.'

p3575
aS'The couple chose Long Meadow Ranch for their venue, known mostly for it s amazing array of fresh, farm to table menu and eclectic wines. The day began at the Andaz Napa where the couple prepared and saw one another for the first time that day. From here, the bridal party made their way to Grgich Hills Estate for some wine tasting and gorgeous romantic photos. Every moment of the day, was thoughtfully planned by Spencer and Shirley   they wanted to make sure all of their favorite vineyards were made a part of this amazing day. In the late afternoon, the bridal party arrived to a cocktail hour at Long Meadow, where Spencer and Shirley greeted and mingled with their guests, before the ceremony took place. By six o clock, Shirley had changed into her gown and each guest was seated beneath an oak tree for a beautiful ceremony, followed by an amazing dinner party. The reception had the best of food and'
p3576
aS'Spencer and Shirley are among the most generous people you will meet. Their wedding day was created around this spirit of generosity. While it was a celebration of their love, they gave back to all of the people around them. Long Meadow Ranch was the perfect venue, providing an amazing menu and beautiful backdrop. Marisa Nicole, designed much of the day, each detail perfectly planned and simply stated. And as their wedding photographers, we are so honored to know this couple. To see their day unfold in front of our lenses and to be inspired by this couple as they gave back to everyone around them.\n'

S'I cannot stop grinning at the site of these adorable sweeties. It s clear that they are madly in love, and their wedding? It s as cute as they come. Both being artists with a love for color, they DIYed their day with an old Hollywood vibe in mind. Mix in blooms of berry pink and pops of orange from The Little Branch and coordination by Orange Blossom Special Events, it s no surprise this gallery from Lukas & Suzy VanDyke is bursting with happiness.'
p3620
aS'From the beautiful Bride  The inspiration for our wedding was a celebration of all things we love. Like most couples, we wanted the wedding to feel really us   which is vintage-y, colorful, and artistic. We are both artists (Ryan works as an animator at Cosmic Toast Studios and I work as a designer at Mattel) and lovers of color, so we wanted to infuse our wedding with DIY projects to reflect that. We also wanted to have an old Hollywood vibe so we could share with our guests what we loved about LA.'
p3621
aS'Our invitations, which I designed, set the tone for our wedding with confetti, gold foil, and glitter! We found ways to incorporate our artwork throughout the celebration, from the illustrated bride and groom buttons for our guests to wear to the cake topper Ryan made that included our beloved pets. I love heart-shaped everything, so our fan programs and confetti were all hearts. Our family and friends literally tossed their love over us during our recessional   it was magical! And as a huge fan of flea markets, I found a vintage pink wicker room divider to use as our altar and over a dozen vintage cake stands for the mini pie dessert station (that went along with a strawberry whipped cream cake from a Chinese bakery as a nod to my heritage).'
p3622
aS'We re always in photobooths, so that was a must-have for our wedding   we hired our favorite one that fit our vintage Hollywood vibe perfectly and they did double prints so our guests could leave one in our guestbook. That was our favorite thing at the end of the night, curling up together and reading through all the special notes our family and friends wrote for us.'
p3623
aS'And of course there was a lot of color! Our favorite colors, pink and orange and gold, were displayed throughout the tassels that we strung up around the venue, and we set up a rainbow vintage soda bar. The Carondelet House is a beautiful space on its own, but we really wanted it to feel like we brought our party into it! Our dinnertime escort cards were gold animals that we DIY d   we chose safari animals because our first date was to the San Diego Zoo. For my bouquet and our tabletop floral arrangements, I wanted to ombre everything because I love colors organized neatly. Our florist did an amazing job ombre-ing the long dining room from whites and blushes to deep red velvets. Then those arrangements were wrapped up in paper cone bouquets at the end of the night as wedding favors for our guests.'
p3624
aS'My wedding dress was amazing kismet   I found it before I was even looking for a dress, after a really rough few months of wedding planning. It was hanging at a booth at the flea market, and the kind vendor let me try it on in the public bathroom   and it fit me perfectly! It was the gorgeous 1950s lace and tulle dress of my dreams.'
p3625
aS'For the ceremony, we wanted to incorporate our artwork in a small way, so we illustrated ourselves on 1.25  buttons for the bride and grooms  guests   that way, it s a fun conversational piece for the guests to start the  are you from the bride or groom s side?  talk. We also designed and hand-cut our heart-shaped fans (Ann loves everything heart-shaped), and cut and designed our bags of heart- shaped confetti to be tossed during the recessional. There were also frill garlands hanging from the rafters in our favorite colors, pink and orange and gold, two giant balloons with frill that Ryan set up, and a vintage pink wicker room divider we found at a flea market last year.'
p3626
aS'We wrote our own vows, and since we are both non-religious, we had a reading of our favorite love poem by e.e. cummings,  I carry your heart with me .'
p3627
aS'For the bar, we provided a rainbow vintage soda bar instead of usual soda cans. We love vintage sodas, and things arranged by color. Regarding dinner service, our escort cards were on gold animals that we DIY d (spray painted and primered and spray painted again ). Like most couples, we wanted to have a wedding that felt the most us. We are both artists, lovers of food, color and animals. So with that in mind, we DIY d a lot of our wedding.'
p3628
aS'We had our fathers each give toasts before dinner, and then during dinner, Ryan s sister (who introduced us) and Ann s college friend each gave toasts. After dinner, our cake was a traditional Chinese strawberry sponge cake, which is one of the few Chinese traditions we included in the wedding. Ann had cakes like this for every birthday growing up. Ryan made the cake toppers, which include our three beloved pets in our day, Oliver, Bettie, and Penny. Then we included a mini pie buffet, since Ryan loves pie, from local baker I Heart Pies.'

S'The eclectic beauty of this Santa Barbara soiree stuns, with pin-worthy details sprinkled throughout the day s events. Set at Villa Verano, a Mission style estate, the ceremony and reception were both ridiculously ravishing. The only thing brighter than the vibrant decor was the bride s smile   one look at the gallery shot by Mirelle Carmichael Photography, and it s not too hard to see why.'
p3668
aS'After that, I knew he was the one. However our respective geographies poised a problem: I lived in California and Ammar lived literally wherever his job took him. After a month of long distance, Ammar joined me in California where we took a blissful 6 month vacation from life: we traveled up and down Highway 101, starting in Carmel and working our way down to San Diego and all the way back up to my hometown of Portland, Oregon. When it came time to choose a place for our wedding, we knew it had to be somewhere along the California coastline as an homage to our epic road trip.'
p3669
aS'After our sabbatical, I traveled to Pakistan to meet Ammar s family where we got engaged. It was bittersweet: while we knew we were going to get married at some point, we didn t exactly know when that would be. A few months after we were engaged, Ammar was finally assigned his next posting in Abuja, Nigeria.'
p3670
aS'Let s just say, we became very skilled at Skype. With my life on hold and my fianc  living in Africa, I had some free time on my hands to start planning our wedding. To keep myself awake long enough to talk to Ammar every night, I wound up spending countless hours reading wedding blogs and perusing Pinterest. I eventually moved to be with Ammar in Nigeria where my master planning continued. We live on a compound run by Ammar s humanitarian organization; while the internet and power were a bit spotty and the idea of a Santa Barbara wedding seemed worlds away, planning our wedding became a daydream-esque hobby. Needless to say, I had every detail planned and ready by April 12th, 2014!'
p3671
aS'Because Ammar and I live so far away from our loved ones, we wanted an experience where everyone could be together at one place for an extended weekend celebration. I shied away from the traditional wedding venues as I wanted to dance the night away without having to worry about time limits. Enter Villa Verano. It s a stunning private property located in the hills of Santa Barbara with built-in d cor and old mission style ambiance. The space has multiple guest rooms, so our entire bridal party was able to stay on the premises.'
p3672
aS'It was important to me that every detail of our wedding was homemade and touched by a loved one. From the throw pillows my mother sewed, to the chalkboard my father built in our garage, to the wedding menus my sister designed, to the jam and pickle favors I made with my grandmother, everything had a story behind it. I wanted my wedding to have an organic, small, homemade, intimate feel similar in essence to the dinner parties I love to throw for friends and family. I choose my vendors with this sentiment in mind as well.'
p3673
aS'All the hard work and attention to detail paid off. It was a truly magical night. I remember walk around stunned thinking to myself, it s exactly how I thought it would look.\n'

S'Ah, Pinterest. The modern Bride s go-to for wedding inspiration heaven, and most often the birth place of so many fabulous DIY projects and sweet touches that pretty up the weddings we share on the daily. Case in point? This rustic, coral-splashed ranch fete from Jasmine Lee Photography. And thanks to this gorg Bride, you can peruse their lovely list of projects below in addition to this beautiful gallery!'
p3747
aS'From the beautiful Bride When we chose Diablo Ranch as our venue, we wanted to make sure that while a working cattle ranch, that is was not a country wedding. We were all for  rustic  and Pinterest delivered a multitude of ideas. So many ideas that for a while I had several weddings planned in my head. I finally honed in on a picture of an outdoor wedding that used copper colored linens and loved it. I added coral for an accent color and that was it. It allowed for simple lanterns for center pieces and small bottles for flowers. The beauty of this venue was that we didn t need a lot of color or decor, it really spoke for itself with the scenery and ambiance of being on a mountain.'
p3748
aS'The DIY was a bit time consuming, but when the day finally arrived we got immense joy from people experiencing all the personal touches we added. I think we were both on a natural high the entire day, but really did soak it all in. Doing  first look  photos took the nervousness away and allowed us to have our moment and then truly relax and enjoy the day. Our friends offered to make corn hole boards as their wedding gift, which sparked the idea to have a few games for our guests. We even played as we were getting ready to walk to the ceremony site. We came up with vows that were about us and asked a good friend to officiate. It made for an intimate ceremony that was truly about us. I can honestly say I don t remember anyone else being there but the two of us and our friend. Ceremony done, we got to enjoy cocktail hour with our friends and family. The baskets of flip flops were gone before we knew it. We used my grandmother s china and silver for our place settings. Another way for us to have someone there that was no longer with us. We danced and enjoyed our guests throughout the night. We did ask guests to include a song to dance to on their RSVP. It got people up and moving, as we intended. We ended with a late night fire pit and smores (hand packaged, of course).\n'

S'Gather  round, SMPers, because we re about to dive head first into a sea of watercolor goodness like you ve never seen before. From the stationery and design by The Romance Between, to the flawless coordination by LVL Weddings & Events, to the drool-worthy florals from Fleuretica, it s layer upon layer of quiet hillside romance, and Kurt Boomer beautifully told the story from start to finish.'
p3796
aS'From the Bride Jason and I wanted our wedding to be romantic, intimate and fun. In a sense, we really wanted to whisk our guests away from their busy lives and simply allow them to enjoy good food amongst great company. We must have researched hundreds of venues but we had an instant connection with Bella Collina and the quaint city of San Clemente. Mixing the natural beauty of the venue and collaborating with Euri from Fleuretica, our vision resulted in an array of gorgeous spring colors nestled in a Tuscany-like hillside.'
p3797
aS'The Romance Between, an event design, planning and paper goods company founded by one of my bridesmaids and I, is slated to launch in January 2015. The company was birthed while designing, lettering and creating things for the wedding. A test trial so to speak. From the welcome baskets, the invitations, calligraphy on the invitations, dessert bar, menu, place cards and the welcome signage, it was all a beautiful process. We incorporated watercolor and brush calligraphy into the invitation suite and tied it with Froufrou Chic s organic ribbons to emanate romance. I can confidently say that a paper goods vendor has the capability to create the entire mood of a wedding. It essentially is the first  gift  guests receive prior to attending the wedding and I am so ecstatic that we were able to find utter joy in doing our own.'
p3798
aS'We were incredibly lucky to work with the most amazing vendors. The wedding day was a lot windier than we had imagined but Kurt captured the wedding flawlessly. He used the wind to deliver some of the most ethereal images we ve ever seen. Euri and her team from Fleuretica created the arch of my dreams and even waited around until the end of the ceremony to ensure that the arch stayed intact through the wind. Kelly and her team from Kelly Zhang Makeup made me and my girls feel beautiful and comfortable in our own skin. Arielle from LVL Events guided us with all of the logistics of the day and did it flawlessly. Allen and Young from Shine Entertainment made our guests laugh and cry all at the same time. Karen, Executive Chef Paul and the team at Bella Collina offered us food and service that our family and friends still rave about to this day. And last but not least, Greg and his team from Fiske Film rolled their cameras all day long to ensure our perfect day was recorded on film. We are so grateful to have found these vendors and thank them daily for allowing our vision to come alive through their talents.'

S'This wedding is my everything. It s the perfect amount of glitz mixed with some serious style thanks to Artisan Events Floral Decor, making my wedding-loving heart sing this morning. But I just have to say, this Bride s Berta gown might just be my favorite to date   so it goes without saying this gallery beautifully captured by Mi Belle Photography will dance in my dreams all day.'
p3852
aS'Myself and my (new) husband, Baz, live in London. I am half Welsh, half American (with Jewish heritage) and Baz is half English, half Persian. My dad was born and raised in Palm Springs and I have always loved spending time there each Summer. Baz also fell in love with the place the first time he visited. The weather, cool vibe, laid-back atmosphere   what s not to love?! When we got engaged in Charleston, South Carolina, we knew we didn t want to risk the British weather and decided on an April wedding in the desert. It also coincided with my grandfather s 100th birthday the day before!'
p3853
aS'We planned the wedding from London which involved a LOT of Skype dates with our vendors! In terms of style, I wanted classic and stylish with a hint of Palm Springs glitz and glamour. My grandmother on my dad s side was an amazing and talented lady, and a lingerie / clothing designer in her day. Her sewing room is still as she left it and I used to love playing with all of her beautiful buttons. It was these that started my inspiration for the styling   beautiful golds, pinks and creams, with an injection of glitter and sparkle. I actually used her vintage buttons as part of the place settings to attach the name tags. I wanted vintage styling, but more opulent and French rather than shabby chic. Ornate gold mirrors and frames, chandeliers, velvet seating, candles   I wanted to bring the inside outside into the open space under the stars. For flowers, I wanted pink peonies, darker pink ranunculas and garden roses, as well as some beautiful hydrangeas to remind me of the UK. Parasols and fans were laid out for guests to protect themselves from the heat, and pashminas to keep them warm from the evening chill (as well as flip-flops to keep the guests dancing and palm tree sunglasses, inflatables and wild animal masks for the dance-floor party)!'
p3854
aS'We ordered a lot of bits to the UK, but dad had to deal with things being delivered every week to the Palm Springs address! We arrived in the states two weeks before the wedding to relax and get prepped   the evenings were spent rounding up family, drinking wine and making confetti bags, glitter signs etc., but it was great fun. We also had to get our wedding license which was a relief!!'
p3855
aS'I love fashion but was worried I would struggle finding the perfect dress. I didn t think I would ever find  the one . I visited a number of shops with family and my bridesmaids, and although I found potential options, none of them were perfect. It was after one full day of dress shopping that I came home and started investigating Israeli dress designers. The problem was that no shops in the UK sold the dresses!!I had just about convinced myself that I would have to make the trip to Tel Aviv when I discovered that there was ONE shop in the UK showing a designer called Berta for one weekend only. Problem was it was Sunday evening and they only had the dresses until Monday. I called up, and they said they were actually holding the dresses for another couple of days, so I booked a train and traveled to Birmingham (about an hour outside of London). I was on my own, so was worried about not having a second opinion, but I knew as soon as I tried on the first dress that it was the one for me. I text my bridesmaid a picture and was on the train home one hour later having ordered my dress. The veil was a full length Italian tulle, the shoes sparkly glitter Louboutins and I had a custom made clip made from vintage brooches and combs for my hair.'
p3856
aS'The bridesmaids were wearing blush pink Two Birds dresses which were perfect seeing as they could wear them in their own style. The flower girl was in a white tutu and glitter flat pumps, and the pageboys in white linen shorts and shirts, braces and bow ties.'
p3857
aS'We were staying in the Gene Autry residence at the Parker which was super cool (and ironically the place my grandpa used to dine with Gene back in the golden era). My chief bridesmaid stayed with me the night before   the next morning we had a chilled girly breakfast then cracked open the bubbly! We wanted to create a real house party atmosphere around the space. Guests sipped on lemonade from the lemonade stand before the ceremony on the backyard, we then had a mariachi for entertainment whilst we had pictures at the windmills in the desert, then we had the reception on the back lawn, under the stars with views of the surrounding mountains. Our first dance was a Frank Sinatra classic  fly me to the moon    fitting seeing as we were in Palm Springs and dancing under the moon, then we all headed back up to the house for the afterparty which wrapped up around 4am We had the breaking of the glass to honour my Jewish family after which guests could say good luck in their language of choice   Mazel Tov, Pob Luc (Welsh) or Mo afagh bashed (Farsi).\n'

S'At first glance, I guessed this stunning Mediterranean-style soiree from B. Schwartz Photography to be set in the Greek countryside rather than sweet Santa Barbara. With it s pure white beauty of a church, olive branches galore and traditions of the locale in every corner, Carter & Cook Event Company nailed this one. And the Bride? She s a glowing Greek goddess, with a few pretty touches from TEAM Hair And Makeup. See even more here in the gallery.'

aS'From the beautiful Bride  Both Teddy and I have played soccer all of our lives from the youth level to the professional level. After Teddy retired from playing professionally, life brought him to Pasadena, California which is where I grew up. One of my first coaching jobs was for a youth club in Pasadena and Teddy was the director of the club. We coached one of the Under 11 girls teams in the club together and the rest is history.'
p3913
aS'We wanted our wedding to have a Classic, romantic, Greek-infused Style. By far my favorite moment of our wedding day was when my cousin Kolin played the guitar and sang the song  Best Seat In The House  as a tribute to my late father.'
p3914
aS'From Carter & Cook Event Company  Makenzie and Teddy met when they were paired to coach a local club soccer team together. They developed a strong friendship as they coached the team to win many big tournaments, becoming one of the best girls teams in all of California. As the team blossomed, so did their relationship. After a few years they started dating and the rest is history!'
p3915
aS'Makenzie and Teddy wanted to create the perfect modern Greek wedding with romantic and ethereal touches. They chose Santa Barbara because of it s obvious beauty and style  it was the perfect backdrop for their Mediterranean wedding. They really wanted to honor both of their families throughout the wedding day. Teddy comes from a Greek family and they really know how to party on the dance floor! The DJ (Christina Baglin) is a cousin of the groom and had all of the guests on the dance floor practicing their traditional Greek moves. Makenzie s cousin surprised her with a beautiful song tribute to her late father. He changed a few of the words to Best Seat in the House by LoCash Cowboys and sang/played guitar. There was not a dry eye in the hall! The bride wore a monogrammed patch from her father s old dress shirt inside her wedding gown as a small way to have him there with her. Alise of Sweet Marie Designs designed the most beautiful arrangements with yellow, green, gold and taupe tones. She brought the couple s inspiration to life and it truly felt like an indoor, shabby chic garden party. Another special Greek touch were the favors. The family had olive oil shipped in from the father of the groom s village in Greece (Kalamata), which is where the couple honeymooned. Makenzie and Teddy bottled it for each guest to take home. We created a few chalkboard details throughout the wedding; the seating arrangement sign, vintage plate table numbers, menus and other signage were chalkboards or made to look like it. The menus and favor tags were designed by Alaina of A Kreative Kraning and the extra large seating assignment chalkboard was beautifully done by Margaret of Nightingale Handmade.'

S'When the Bride came across Rancho Las Lomas, with its lush, romantic gardens that reminded her of her favorite childhood book, The Secret Garden, this al fresco affair followed suit. Captured by Anna Costa, along with florals by Jenny B. Floral Design and coordination by The Charming Little Event Company, it s an open-air charmer loaded with pretty flower details and the perfect vintage vignettes curated by Found Vintage Rentals. See it all here.'
p3963
aS'Our October wedding was an intimate affair shared with family and close friends. Rancho Las Lomas, nestled in the foothills in Silverado, reminded me of my favorite childhood book, The Secret Garden. The location was romantic, whimsical and a little mysterious with its lush gardens, rustic buildings, fountains, and hidden corners. It was the perfect environment in which to hold our wedding and I wanted our decorations to echo these surroundings. Our floral decorations had a mixture of eucalyptus, garden roses, dahlias and hydrangeas. Our ceremony, cocktail, and reception areas were accented with beautiful, rustic wooden tables and doors from Found Vintage Rentals. We wanted soft and warm hues to bring out the fall season without the usual yellows and oranges, so we chose a neutral palette consisting of cream, taupe, pink and burgundy. Our reception area was decorated with strings of lights hanging above and we lined a nearby bridge with numerous candles. This venue, combined with the d cor and lighting, created a truly magical ambiance for us.'
p3964
aS'For a whole year and half previous, I had put so much thought and care into creating our beautiful day. With the help of our wonderful vendors, it was so satisfying to see everything finally come together and we couldn t be more thankful. '

S'I think brunch weddings are the best idea since sliced bread. Seriously, morning vows followed by mimosas is about as good as it gets, and this backyard affair from WINK! Weddings and onelove photography is all the proof we need. From the bride s pale blue Oscar De La Renta to the waffle and bacon-filled menu, this is one wedding I would die to attend.'

aS'From The Bride Jimmy and I aren t stuffy people. Having a nighttime extravagant affair just wasn t us. We are fun-loving and casual and love to spend our weekends being social together with friends and family. That s how we landed on the idea of doing an elegant brunch. Rather than spending the entire day apart, having our ceremony at 10 am allowed us to spend the most important day of our lives together and with the ones we love.'
p4007
aS'Being that our reception was held in early afternoon in a family friend s backyard, I decided to go for a short dress. I searched and searched both bridal salons and off the rack and found only reception dresses (short, beaded, fancy frocks not what I was looking for). I realized I may need to think outside the box a bit and when I saw the pale blue Oscar de la Renta, I knew that would be perfect. It really became the backdrop for the entire theme of the wedding. We stuck to various shades of blue, pink, and orange from our invitations and signage to our flowers. One of my favorite finds was the cobalt blue cake stands that we found at Archive Vintage. They elevated the floral centerpieces and added a bold pop of color to every table!\n'

S'Don t champagne towers make you want to celebrate? We just know when the champagne s a flowin, a gorgeous black tie affair is on the horizon. And the Biltmore in Santa Barbara knows how to host just such an affair along with beautiful rich details by Jill La Fleur, blush flowers with pops of orange by Blue Magnolia and an elegant candlelit reception captured by Michael & Anna Costa. See it all here.'
p4063
aS'From The Bride We were attracted to the effortless and understated sophistication that inspires the relaxed Santa Barbara lifestyle. It s impossible not to feel more alive and healthy here, and it s no surprise why this part of the country is called the American Riviera. Plus, anyone who knows me well knows I am obsessed with Spain and the Mediterranean. As soon as Santa Barbara was on our wedding venue radar, I thought it was the perfect backdrop:  Spanish Colonial architecture, wine country, lavender fields, olive trees, ideal climate, and the ocean and mountains. We both also loved the classic, timeless feel of the Four Seasons Biltmore. The hotel is nestled in the Montecito foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains, overlooks the Pacific ocean, has lush gardens, and is a place any girl would feel incredibly lucky to plan her wedding (which is exactly how I felt).  We kicked off the weekend festivities with a wine country trip, including a pit stop to pick up Enjoy Cupcakes in Los Olivos to celebrate my husband s birthday (who doesn t love wine and cupcakes??), followed by an outdoor welcome cocktail reception in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara.\n  \nWe wanted to amplify the celebratory mood and play up on the California Spanish style, so we invited guests for a ceremony prelude, where they were greeted with Spanish guitar, white sangria and sparkling wine, fresh fruit, and rosemary and raspberry-infused lemonade. We wanted to create a space that was not stuffy, but tastefully relaxed and joyful. Our wedding was intimate, in a private garden near the ocean, and it felt like our own hidden space. I personally think the whole idea of an ostentatious wedding has been overdone. As a couple, we gravitate toward the idea that simplicity is more sophisticated.  We let its natural beauty shine, and kept d cor minimal; we brought in custom chairs, hung garlands of bay leaves and flowers alongside the aisle, and added larger arrangements where we exchanged our vows.\n  '
p4064
aS'Immediately following the ceremony, we all toasted with a champagne tower I was very excited about that!  The cocktail hour was al fresco (which I love) we had an open bar and also offered an elderflower champagne cocktail and a grapefruit margarita, which complemented the color palette. In addition to passed hors d oeuvres with crowd-pleasers like mini gourmet cheeseburgers with parmesan fries and black bean empanadas, we also were really pleased with how the Four Seasons did such an excellent job of incorporating local ingredients, such as fresh lobster, avocado, Point Reyes blue cheese, and California olive oil into other appetizers. We also included a cheese station and charcuterie, sushi and a raw bar for our guests. We kept the escort table unfussy, so as not to compete with the hotel d cor, and instead chose classic ivory paper goods and fragrant gardenias as an accent. Cocktail tables were topped with single gardenias and petite terrariums.'
p4065
aS'  \n Walking into our reception space exceeded our expectations, and our entire vision was executed so flawlessly. We had added weathered oak cross-back chairs and long feasting tables lined with natural linens and touches of citrus and succulents, as well beautiful bud vases and larger blooming arrangements done in a palette of corals, melons, ivories and greens. Kerstin of Blue Magnolia incorporated hydrangea, garden roses, dahlias, poppies and ranunculus, along with pops of color, texture, and clementines. Soft votive candles flickered to create a beautiful glow, which is super flattering for dinner conversations. I felt so involved in the wedding details that I really enjoyed being surprised with the final result. There were so many thoughtful touches, down to the olive sprigs on each napkin and local Santa Barbara wines. We really wanted our guests to feel like they were at a dinner party, and give them something beyond what they might expect.  \n  \n Now for the praise: we were so incredibly lucky to work with such a talented team. Their professionalism gave us confidence while we were planning from the opposite side of the country, and allowed us to truly enjoy a stress-free day. Jill LaFleur has such a graceful and relaxed presence, which immediately put us at ease. I sometimes have a hard time relinquishing control, but it was easy to put my trust in her and she worked her magic to tie everything together beautifully. We could not have asked for a better husband and wife team than Michael and Anna Costa, who captured our day so beautifully and made us feel so comfortable. Kerstin Horneman of Blue Magnolia is so warm and personable, and practically read my mind when it came to what I wanted. Maria Axiotis of the Four Seasons is so poised and I felt like I d known her for years. My advice when selecting a supportive team is to listen to one s gut because our first impressions did not fail us and it all felt like a natural fit.\n  \n Our wedding was personal, honest and full of so many tender moments. It was a day full of love, and truly better than we could have ever imagined. Our family and friends helped make it an unforgettable day, and we are looking forward to an excuse to return for anniversaries!  \n'

aS'From the beautiful Bride Richard and I are both from Chicago and moved to Los Angeles 4 years ago. When Richard proposed we both decided that we wanted to get married here in California where we started our life together and where we are building our future. We knew that it would mean some of the important people in our lives wouldn t be able to make the trip, but from the beginning we wanted our wedding to be exactly what we wanted and not worry what other people thought. The moment I stepped into the Dana Powers barn I knew it was where I wanted to get married. It took my breath away. From there, everything fell together. My family owns a floral business in Chicago so of course I knew I was in good hands from the start. Our wedding was all about the fun, personalized details and enjoying the natural beauty of the California coast. We worked with the absolute best vendors and everything turned out exactly as I had imagined. Everything was truly  us  from the mac and cheese and root beer floats, to the beautiful peonies, to the sequined tablecloths. I loved every minute of it! My advice to brides planning would be to not be afraid to do what you think is fun and don t worry about what others think or expect! Its your day!\n'

S'A bold bride is a fabulous bride in my book. A beauty who is willing to steer away from the norm, even in subtle ways. Take this stunning lady for instance  donning a vibrant turquoise statement necklace, dressing her bridesmaids in gorg black gowns from Two Birds Bridesmaid and kicking aside heels for comfy flats. I think she has the right idea and it s just the start  there s so much more to love about this wildly beautiful day from Wai Reyes Photography.'
p4143
aS'From Wai Reyes Photography  Brittany and MJ are as awesome as they come. We hit it off from day one, despite them needing to bend so low just to hug me back. I never felt so short until I met these two, who are like supermodels in looks and in build (bride is 6  tall). I knew from our first meeting being part of their wedding would be one of the highlights of my year. I first met with Brittany and MJ in 2012 for their 2014 wedding. I thought then,  wow, they sure are taking their time! . And they did, with plenty to spare. Everyone was in good spirits on the day of, family and friends were all excited with anticipation, and there was not a single dry eye as the two said their I Do s.'
p4144
aS'What I especially liked about this wedding was how laid back it was. Brittany wore the teal jewelries to match her emerald engagement ring that she wears everyday and opted for flat sandals for her bridal shoes. I d like to go on record in saying that she s probably one of the easiest brides to get along with: she s not only beautiful and funny, but she s as real as it gets. And one can agree that s perhaps the traits MJ loves about her. He can t not look at her and not have a smile on his face; and likewise. As their wedding photographer, capturing moments from a couple who are so happy and in love is the best part of the job.\n'

p4187
aS'From The Bride The inspiration behind the day was romantic elegance joined with the rustic enchantment of nature. The giant redwood trees in the grove create an atmosphere that was both grand and intimate.'
p4188
aS'The ceremony was held inside a redwood tree circle. This particular circle, according to the property owner, took between 16,000 to 20,000 years to grow. A redwood tree circle is created when an original parent tree dies. It leaves saplings in a small circle around the dead tree. These saplings are too close to get the proper nutrients to grow into full-size trees, so they slowly push themselves outwards until they are far enough apart to reach maturity.'
p4189
aS'To promise our lives together within such a divine soul of the earth was a humbling and sacred experience. We were captivated by the beauty of the property as a whole- the redwoods, stream, pond and log cabin filled with antiques were all perfection. We felt transformed to another time.'
p4190
aS'We knew we wanted a romantic, handmade feeling to the wedding. We designed and printed all of the paper goods. We also designed, hand dyed in tea, and screen printed all of the hankies ourselves. We chose family style catering and locally sourced handmade pies to fit the cozy and rustic vibe. Pies were chosen not only because WE LOVE PIE, but also because it means something to us.'
p4191
aS'For our first date, Cooper came over to my apartment and baked an apple crisp from scratch. A handsome man who can bake!? I was sold. We chose a polaroid guest book, so we could look at everyone s happy, adorable faces as we read their sweet messages and words of wisdom.'
p4192
aS'Our friends helped create the ceremony backdrop, my sister-in-law helped stamp the envelopes for the birdseed with  R&C,  my sister did my nails, and my bestie and her awesome man took the gorgeous photos and video we will cherish for a lifetime.'

aS'I met Cooper nearly four years ago at a bar in the LES in NYC one Saturday night where his gypsy punk rock band was playing. I fell in love with him on stage. Trips to apple orchards and mix CD s followed. We were an electric connection. My love for him grows more with every new moment we share together.'

Walking out after the ceremony and crying tears of joy, squeezing each other, and laughing.

p4201
aS'I loved every moment of this day and it went by in a whoosh. Part of the bonding experience that the whole guest list shared on this Saturday was that there was no cell service at the venue at all. Everyone by default just tucked away their iPhones to just enjoy. (Or if you re me, put it on Airplane Mode to preserve battery so you can snap photos all night!) I m not sure I ve ever been prouder to submit the artifacts of a wedding. This day was just twinkly and magical!\n'

aS'From The Bride Andrew and I met at one of my best friend s weddings in Los Olivos, California. After strategically being placed at the same table, through a little bit of conversation we realized that we both had relatives back in Dallas, Texas. Over Christmas when we were visiting our families, we went on our fist date and we immediately knew there was something deeper there. I picked the coffee house we met at finding out later that this was a test to see if I would go major corporation or local business. I am glad he cares about these things and also glad that I had already gotten my coffee chain fix that morning!'
p4240
aS'We wanted our wedding to feel simple, relaxed, and elegant. I really tried to stay away from anything that was trendy. The first venue we signed with ended up canceling on us last minute. Despite the urge to have a complete nervous breakdown, we realized this was simply a second chance to plan our wedding. We now knew what was important and what wasnt and how to efficiently research venders. The Santa Barbara Historical Museum was even lovelier than our first venue and am so thankful it worked out the way it did. The mud and straw walls, spanish tiles, terraces, fountains, and beautiful landscaping made this a perfect setting for our wedding. All it needed was crazy beautiful flowers from the talented Anna Le Pley. I wanted to have succulents, peonies, lavender, coral snapdragons, bougainvillea and white stalk all in different brass containers. She created the most lovely arrangements I have ever seen. Our baker, Lori Stern, whipped together 20 different pies including strawberry-rhubarb, citrus, and chocolate pie along with some homemade whipped creams. They not only were delicious but so beautiful and interesting to look at.'
p4241
aS'Our favorite parts of the wedding were a few details that were very personal. One was the first time we saw one another before our ceremony. Our insanely talented musicians serenaded us with some of our favorite songs in the distance while our photographer, Diana McGregor, perfectly captured every moment. We also loved taking communion during our ceremony from a carved wooden cup Andrew s mom brought back from Israel, all while his sister sang Justin Timberlake s  Mirrors.  On a creative note, I designed the cactus print for our wedding invitations and our handsome little ring bearer presented the rings on a pillow that I hand stitched for this day. As far as jewelry, I wore a tiny gold ring around my neck that my mother had given me when I was 10, my sister, the maid of honor, wore our matching  sister earrings,  and Andrew wore his new gold tie clip that I had custom made for him. Last but not least, I carried with me down the isle a little blue and gold cameo pin on my bouquet that belongs to my granddad.'

S'Looking to be inspired? Thanks to the team of Kent Avenue Photography and Loop Flowers and Events, you can look no further! Berry toned blooms add a pop of color against the green hills of the Marin Headlands, creating a wildly romantic setting for this next photoshoot. Head to the gallery for more. Inspiration and beauty awaits.'
p4281
aS'Pair all this loveliness with the majestic, rugged beauty of the Marin Headlands and we were in heaven! Talk about being over stimulated. Magnificent, undulating hills appear to rise from the earth and hug the coastline. The earthy smell of eucalyptus lingers in the air. Crashing waves, windswept hills, hidden coves and isolated beaches make for a truly mind blowing experience. Gravel-lined paths wind their way through high grasses, against hills peppered with spring wildflowers and teeming with wildlife, down to the jagged coastline. Late afternoon fog swims through the peaks and valleys of the hills and settles over panorama ocean views.'
p4282
aS'This wildly romantic setting could not have been a more perfect location for our bridal session s moody, rich, berry palette. A sweet bench (perfect for two) was topped with oversized, lilac-linen pillows. Lush, garden-inspired floral arrangements sat atop layered, natural linens and paired with crystal-cut glasses and vintage silver flatware. Gorgeous, hand drawn menus and place cards featured whimsical botanical elements. A chocolate naked cake was layered with rich buttercream and fresh berries. The bride was outfitted in an ivory leavers lace dress and delicate, handmade hair accessories   a vintage, lace bridal cap and a gold, intricate floral, swarovski crystal headpiece. Pure romance.'

S'When we get our hands on a gorgeous garden wedding like this one from Dave Richards Photography, it s a good, good day at SMP. Because when you pair up fluffy blooms, vintage bits, delicate laces, a purely spectacular setting like Maravilla Gardens and loads of California sunlight? There s no denying this sweet wedding concoction will fill you with sweeping love.'
p4318
aS'From the beautiful Bride  I wanted the wedding to be a  secret garden  theme. Both Michael and I are earth signs and love nature. We wanted to get married outdoors and were very inspired by the natural beauty of the gardens at Maravilla. We didn t want anything too flashy or over the top. Which is why our color pallet was very muted with neutrals and whites. I would say my personal style for the wedding was  romantic.  I had a Grecian influence and was drawn to delicate laces, vintage pieces and also anything bohemian. I wanted to have a timeless look that I would still love years down the road.'
p4319
aS'Additional Notes: Bride and Groom were married by a long time family friend. The cake was made by the Groom s mother. Wedding signs were hand painted by the Bride s sister. Also, the bride designed her own dress and Liza made the dress at her shop!\n'

S'This wedding is best described by the bride as boho with a side of fancy, fancy which translates into equal parts killer style and vendor dream team. From design by Yifat Oren & Stefanie Cove, to richly hued florals by The Velvet Garden and Gia Canali behind the lens. In the full gallery you ll find a moonlit ceremony so enchanting followed by a ballroom reception with glamour tucked into every nook.'
p4370
aS'From Gia Canali .Nicole and Doug are among our favorite couples ever, for so many reasons, not least of which is their abundance of humor and their exuberance. Their moonlit ceremony-in-the-round was incredibly romantic. And they didn t have a seated dinner reception. It was more like a roving feast with an endless dance party.'
p4371
aS'The bride wore her grandmother s antique jewels and the groom wore his grandfather s cufflinks. They had champagne in coupes and Kir Royals as their signature drinks.'
p4372
aS'From The Bride It was Nicole s birthday and Doug woke her up with their dog Sheldon dressed in a tuxedo. (Sheldon is from the streets, but his essence is fancy. So we always thought he belonged in a tux and joked about it constantly). Nicole thought this was just a very thoughtful way to ring in her 28th year. When Doug suggested a hike in Griffith Park, Nicole threw on some sweat pants, and they both decided Sheldon should keep his tuxedo on. When they reached a beautiful plateau, where they normally stop to stretch and drink water, Doug asked a stranger to take a photo of them. Nicole picked up Sheldon and smiled for the camera, but did not feel Doug next to her. When she turned around to see what was up, he was on his knee with a ring. The stranger who Doug had asked to photograph the moment, was actually  a plant.  They had done a  dry run  two weeks prior, and he got the whole thing on video. When they got back to their house, Doug had arranged for all Nicole s favorite foods (so, cheese) and champagne to be waiting for them upon arrival. That night, Doug surprised Nicole again, when she walked into a room filled with all of their closest friends, who thought they were there to celebrate her birthday. After a day like this, Nicole wasn t sure whether Doug was trying to marry her or give her a heart attack and kill her.'
p4373
aS'Nicole got deep into Pinterest. Stone Fox Bride has some amazing boards to pull from. When we decided our dress code was going to be  Bohemian Black Tie,  Nicole had a blast making this super intense board for inspiration. It is mostly photos of Elton John wearing feathers and sequins. So, not that helpful to guests who were looking for a  rational explanation. '
p4374
aS'We wanted it to just be a kick ass party from start to finish. We also had this theme of  circles  putting the emphasis on inclusiveness and warmth. The dance floor was a giant circle, we drank from coupes, and most importantly, we got married  in the round.  That night, there were no separations, sides, or factions. Just total unity and oneness. At least that s what we told people the true reason is that we love being the center of attention.'
p4375
aS'- We read our own vows, and Doug final vow was,  I can t wait to spend the rest of my life looking for your cell phone. \n   Nicole, hopping on stage, and singing  Crazy in Love  with the band, which brought the house down. It was a completely impromptu moment, brought on by the Nicole s  magic weave  (clip-in hair extensions really are everything).\n   After the band played, DJ Sam French got on the ones and twos and everyone danced until 3:30 am.\n   Also, Superman crashed the wedding, and bought everyone jack and cokes.'
p4376
aS'The best advice we received was to live in the moment as much as possible and don t be a dick. Our advice is the same to other couples live in the moment as much as possible and don t be a dick. As well as the sense of joy and gratitude that we each felt was palpable. We truly LIVED every moment.\n'

From the Bride s lovely veil made by the Groom s mother and her shoes custom-made by her twin brother, to the flowy chuppah, cork signage, pillows, invitations and everything in between, this day is jam-packed with hand-crafted details. Even the Bride s Uncle stepped in to officiate. It s one pretty package of homemade love SMPers.'
p4425
aS'From the beautiful Bride  The day was perfect in my eyes. I married the man of my dreams, my best friend and partner of 9 years in the most picturesque setting at breathtaking Holman Ranch which is nestled in the rolling hills of Carmel Valley. We were surrounded by our dearest family and friends during our much anticipated wedding day. I could not wait to be in the moment, at my wedding to see my husband and for the many details of our wedding to come together at last. Many of our friends and family members contributed to making the day unique and special. My Uncle Alan was one of these individuals who became ordained for the occasion and married us. The ceremony was beautiful, personal, light hearted and a mix of two cultures coming together as one (Jewish and Japanese). The chuppah we were married under was constructed by my parents-in-law Glenn and Donna. It was stunning and created the perfect canopy for us to begin our married life under. '
p4426
aS'The veil I wore, along with the flower girl basket and ring bearer pillow were made by my mother-in-law Kathy. Carl s sister created a gorgeous picture out of 1,000 paper cranes of two coy fish in a pond as a wedding gift for us. My mother collected jars and mirror glass sprayed all of the center pieces, and made 100 succulent garden name tags as take home gifts out of baby food jars. We corked signs and letters from 10 inch tall letters I bought from a MardiGras website for less than $3 each! Friends and family baked an array of desserts for our home baked goods bar. We had sake instead of champagne! My college girlfriends all wore blue dresses to be my something blue. A few of our friends brought their GoPros in place of a videographer since it was not in the budget and captured the most special moments of the day. My husband designed all of the paper products himself, from the save the dates, to the invitations, to the ketubah. He is truly talented! My twin brother custom designed and hand painted my wedding shoes. As we know it, our fathers played a tremendous roll and payed for gas while we navigated the way. It truly was a group effort. The day following our Friday wedding we went wine tasting with 30-40 people and then my in-laws hosted a BBQ for 100 people. It was the event of a lifetime. '
p4427
aS'The most special moments to me were seeing my groom for the first time during our first look and holding his hands, starring into his eyes during our ceremony as we made promises for a lifetime with our personal vows. I was the happiest as is physically possible, so consumed with love and emotions. It was incredible. We attended 9 weddings in 12 months last year and were able to gather a lot of inspiration for our day. We knew what made past weddings memorable to us, and a few of the most important things were to have a few consecutive days of events to prolong the time with our guests, a stunning venue, phenomenal food, a talented photographer that would capture our special day for eternity, a good DJ to keep the party flowing and most importantly a ceremony that was personal and reflected our personalities, our relationship and our values. It was perfect.\n'

It makes a healthy dose of color look elegant, refined and all at once gorgeous. With layers of textured details by Davia Lee Events mingling with the prettiest hued blooms by Inviting Occasion, gold dipped furniture by Found Rentals and a day positively brimming with happy.'
p4477
aS'From Davia Lee Events From my perspective, some of the most special aspects of this wedding was the amount of family love and support that went into it. The caterer was the grooms brother in law, the amazing young man that sang when lauren walked down the aisle & for their first dance was her nephew. There was family from near & far with many traveling all the way from Mexico. You could just feel the love all night long! From a design standpoint, working with Larrissa to create the beautiful ceremony backdrop and chapel like feeling in La Cav was one of my absolute favorite details to see come to life. It was truly a work of art, so special and so unique for this wedding. You felt as if you escaped from California and were transported to a little stone chapel in France. The design standpoint for dinner was al fresco dining with subtle details and hints. The beautiful La Tavola Linens and china from Town & Country created the perfect palette for a beautifully presented dinner menu. All of the small hand crafted details such as the painted menus, incredible 16ft charcuterie display & beer and wine tasting for cocktail hour really proved that their guest comfort was their number one priority and it was a wedding that ended far too soon!'
p4478
aS'From Jen Huang Photography I absolutely love color, so I was so happy to see Lauren and Jorge s bright pops of color against the neutral, natural stone of Sunstone Winery. The subtle stones, pink peonies and flow-y navy bridesmaids were such a visual symphony. Little details by Davia and Larissa that I thought were so beautiful were the delightful pairings of flowers and gold vases and fancy gold rimmed furniture. Did anyone notice the tiny little daisies in the bouquets that echoed the pieces of gold found in the decor and the absolutely adorable flower girl and her crown? I also love a good charcuterie spread, and this one didn t disappoint, with layers of meats and cheeses and fruits in rustic, primitive wooden bowls and wax paper, all atop aged wine barrels in the Sunstone wine room. The dinner transformed the wedding from rustic to modern with lovely hanging glass chandeliers, textured La Tavola linens and gorgeous fluted glassware. Such a feast for the senses!\n'

S'Jen Huang Photography has been sharing loads of goodies with us today and it s culminating in this tuscan inspired gem. It makes a healthy dose of color look elegant, refined and all at once gorgeous. With layers of textured details by Davia Lee Events mingling with the prettiest hued blooms by Inviting Occasion, gold dipped furniture by Found Rentals and a day positively brimming with happy.'
p4577
aS'From Davia Lee Events From my perspective, some of the most special aspects of this wedding was the amount of family love and support that went into it. The caterer was the grooms brother in law, the amazing young man that sang when lauren walked down the aisle & for their first dance was her nephew. There was family from near & far with many traveling all the way from Mexico. You could just feel the love all night long! From a design standpoint, working with Larrissa to create the beautiful ceremony backdrop and chapel like feeling in La Cav was one of my absolute favorite details to see come to life. It was truly a work of art, so special and so unique for this wedding. You felt as if you escaped from California and were transported to a little stone chapel in France. The design standpoint for dinner was al fresco dining with subtle details and hints. The beautiful La Tavola Linens and china from Town & Country created the perfect palette for a beautifully presented dinner menu. All of the small hand crafted details such as the painted menus, incredible 16ft charcuterie display & beer and wine tasting for cocktail hour really proved that their guest comfort was their number one priority and it was a wedding that ended far too soon!'

aS'From Jen Huang Photography I absolutely love color, so I was so happy to see Lauren and Jorge s bright pops of color against the neutral, natural stone of Sunstone Winery. The subtle stones, pink peonies and flow-y navy bridesmaids were such a visual symphony. Little details by Davia and Larissa that I thought were so beautiful were the delightful pairings of flowers and gold vases and fancy gold rimmed furniture. Did anyone notice the tiny little daisies in the bouquets that echoed the pieces of gold found in the decor and the absolutely adorable flower girl and her crown? I also love a good charcuterie spread, and this one didn t disappoint, with layers of meats and cheeses and fruits in rustic, primitive wooden bowls and wax paper, all atop aged wine barrels in the Sunstone wine room. The dinner transformed the wedding from rustic to modern with lovely hanging glass chandeliers, textured La Tavola linens and gorgeous fluted glassware. Such a feast for the senses!\n'

Today s charmer from Jasmine Lee Photography done up DIY style is earthy, cozy and oh-so-lovely and it blends right in with the laid-back vibe, those gorgeously distressed stone walls and ah-mazing views.

aS'From the beautiful Bride  Our wedding was almost entirely handmade, we had our families help out with creating many of the creative touches for the wedding. We wanted our wedding to reflect our personalities and create a truly memorable day for our guests. We began with a beautiful outdoor location for the ceremony at the Holman Ranch in Carmel Valley, CA and had our reception in the Ocean Avenue Room at the IL Fornaio Restaurant. Our venues set the mood for the wedding and we simply filled it with beautiful handmade accents.'
p4620
aS'My wedding dress was my own design and was handmade by a family friend. I also carved out the anchor stamp for the favor bags that were made by my mom with help from other family members. My favorite project for the wedding was creating the flower bouquets and the centerpieces, my dad made the flower boxes and then the rest of the family helped out making the flower arrangements. Aside from that, my brother made the cake signs and the chair signs, I painted the seating sign, and my parents helped collect decorative items to display at our reception.\n'

S'If you ve read SMP for any length of time, you know that I have a love affair with Jose Villa. Aside from being a good person and an even better friend, he is so incredibly thoughtful, so incredibly careful with his work that you can t help but walk away entirely inspired to make your life just as beautiful. And this wedding made even more lovely by a team of vendors - Laura Hooper Calligraphy, Flower Allie, The Butter End Cakery & more  - is nothing if not completely and entirely intoxicating. And there are TONS more Jose photos in the gallery!'
p4692
aS'From Jos  Villa Photography Mark and Becky took great care in making sure their wedding was personal and thoughtful, with plenty of charm and elegance. Mark, a Sales Director for a private jet company, wanted a high-rise city backdrop and Becky, an Executive Manager & Event Designer for a Public Relations firm, wanted a classic and romantic ballroom setting. The London West Hollywood was their perfect compromise.'
p4693
aS'The wedding weekend kicked off with a formal Vietnamese tea ceremony and rehearsal dinner for 100 guests at Il Cielo, Beverly Hills to honor the bride s heritage. Inspired by Grace Kelly s wedding gown, Becky wore a custom Vietnamese Ao Dai and headdress made of French lace and hand-beaded Swarovski crystals and pearls. In keeping with the Vietnamese tradition, guests presented the couple with red envelopes and shared well-wishes and prudent advice for their marriage.'
p4694
aS'The London West Hollywood s rooftop provided a spectacular backdrop of Los Angeles for Mark and Becky s wedding ceremony the following day. Drawing inspiration from a pergola in an English rose garden she visited in Hertfordshire, Becky enlisted the help of Allison Becker & Nicholas St. Clair of Flower Allie to construct a custom wrought iron gazebo to hold a 300 pound vintage champagne chandelier she had sourced. To bring the English garden charm to Hollywood, cascading white blooms and hundreds of white rose petals covered the ceremony site. A string quartet played Pachelbel s Canon in D as the bride, wearing a custom Lazaro gown, walked down the candle-lined aisle on her father s arm. The groom wore a classic Dior Homme black tuxedo and the couple exchanged rings from Harry Winston.'
p4695
aS'The English sentiment was carried throughout the details of the wedding from the custom crest & letterpressed calligraphy, created by Laura Hooper, to the five-course Gordon Ramsey catered dinner. Escort & seating cards were hand embossed with a gold leaf motif to match the bride s headpiece   a DIY labor of love from the bride and her mother in-law. Lush arrangements of ranunculus, garden roses, peonies, sweet pea, jasmine and hydrangeas brought the romantic garden feel to dinner. A six tier confection, created by The Butter End, piped in buttercream with delicate lace applique sat on a bed of fresh flowers. Assortments of vintage gold candlesticks, frames and trays accented the reception space to add to the antique mood of the elegant ballroom. A gourmet burger bar provided a much needed midnight snack as the newlyweds and their 180 guests danced the night away to the tunes of West Coast Music s JB Project and DJ Z.\n'

S'I think that even more than the photographs   from OneLove Photography, which are absurdly delicious   I fell in love with this wedding because of what the bride wrote.  Our ceremony was very heartfelt, you could feel the happiness, tears, the smiles all over the church.  EXACTLY what a wedding should feel like and beautiful to boot. There is so much more right here.'
p4739
aS'From The Bride Our wedding was everything we wanted it to be. and we have to Thank Chabeli and Laurel from P.S. plans and Phil and Krista from OneLove Photography for making sure our day was amazing. We also have to thank all our friends and family from all their help we had our fair share of DIY.'
p4740
aS'I have to start by sharing the details of my dress. It was handmade by my aunt. I m the only girl in the family and ever since I was born she was ready for this day. She worked for 4 months on my dress along with helping make my mom s dress and my mother-in law s, she made us all look amazing. I couldn t have asked for anything else. I felt so honored to walk down the isle. She made every detail with care, she also made my veil, my purse and my garters. She was so proud and happy, everyone still compliments us both on the dress.'
p4741
aS'Our ceremony was held at St. Vincent church in Los Angeles. One of the prettiest church in town. The ceremony was held in Spanish and English, we wanted to make sure that everyone would be able to share the special moment with us.'
p4742
aS'The ceremony was very special, one of the most heartfelt moments for those close to me and Eli was to be able to see my parents hand off their only daughter to my husband. Our ceremony was very heartfelt, you could feel the happiness, tears, the smiles all over the church. One meaningful moment aside from vows of course was the priest never removed our lazo. As he declared us husband and wife, we noticed we still had it on, he looked at us and said   you are now one, so you can walk as one  and so we walked as one.'
p4743
aS'Our reception was held the roof top of the Petersen Museum. It had an amazing view and set the mood for our wedding. Eli and I are designed oriented we really liked the contemporary look. We wanted something simple but elegant. We had long tables so it felt like we were all gathered as a big family. We had a lounge area inside the  glass box  for people to enjoy some music and dance the night away. We did a dessert bar to commemorate our first date and our passion for sweets.'

aS'From The Bride Kyle and I met ten years ago at the University of Southern California. My roommate brought me to a party one night, telling me that she had a feeling I would really like this nice guy Kyle from Kansas City. From the first time I saw him sitting on an air mattress and strumming Radiohead songs on his guitar, I knew my roommate was right.'
p4782
aS'During the years that we lived together in Los Angeles, the Santa Barbara Wine Country became our very favorite weekend destination to escape from the city. Although we have since relocated to New York City, Kyle and I decided to return to Southern California for our wedding as it represented a place of happiness and many fond memories for us, not to mention the ideal weather. We chose Stanford Winery & Vineyards in Lompoc for our wedding venue because of its rustic beauty and incredible flexibility that the property offered.'
p4783
aS'Our ceremony took place on the lawn behind the barrel room with the picturesque Sanford vineyards and Santa Rita hills as a backdrop. Guests then moved to the patio and barrel room for a cocktail hour with a mini wine tasting flight and hors d oeuvres. For dinner, we worked with NLC Productions and Seasons Catering to develop three incredible stations to reflect our favorite foods from New York, Kansas City, and Southern California. For dessert, a variety of mini cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes were served and guests were also invited to cook s  mores on the back patio. The whole party danced up a storm in the open air patio surrounded by the enormous steel wine aging tanks. Guests took home a wooden flash drive customized with our initials and a playlist of our favorite songs played at the wedding.'
p4784
aS'We couldn t have asked for a more proactive and talented team of artists to help us plan this wedding from across the country. NLC Productions truly inspired us with their ideas and execution and somehow managed to make the Sanford property even more gorgeous than it already was. We had a blast developing our menu with Seasons Catering and their staff couldn t have been more pleasant. Although we are typically a camera shy couple, Michael and Anna Costa Photography helped us feel perfectly relaxed and captured so many stunning memories from the day. And Luna Bella Hair & Makeup made the women in both of our families feel natural and beautiful throughout the day.\n'

aS'From The Bride  Quintan and I met during a rare snow week in Dallas, TX in February of 2011- the same week the Superbowl was in Dallas. Since businesses were shut down and our offices were closed my girlfriends and I went to a well-known Dallas restaurant (Mi Cocina) for lunch and a few Mambo Taxi s (Margarita s). Quintan also happened to be there with a group of his friends and in the empty restaurant the waiter decided to sit our two tables right next to each other. After a few margaritas Quintan and his friends decided to break the ice with a few jokes and by the end of the night our tables were pushed together and everyone was getting to know each other. Quintan introduced himself to me early on and we had an immediate connection and spent the rest of the day getting to know each other and drinking a few too many margaritas. The best part is that most of our friends who were there that first day were bridesmaids and groomsmen in our wedding.'
p4841
aS'When Quintan and I were dating we would visit my parents in California and would stay at Terranea Resort while we were there. We loved spending time at the resort and it sort of turned into our favorite quiet spot to get away and spend quality time with each other. On February 2nd, 2013 (the same day we met 2 years earlier) during an impromptu trip to Terranea he proposed in our favorite ocean side villa in front of the fire pit. He played our favorite song ( Cinema  by Jason Evigan) and said some of the nicest words I have ever heard   even though I cried through the entire thing! After we toasted with champagne and a beautiful bouquet of flowers was delivered to our room. Quintan knew how important my family was to me and knew that when he proposed the first thing I would want to do is tell my mom all of the details. He had asked my father for permission to marry me the day before and arranged for them to come meet us for dinner after the proposal. Later that night we went to The Strand House in Manhattan Beach and had dinner with my parents and toasted and celebrated the rest of the night.'
p4842
aS'I am not a big fan of color   I love neutrals. So the color scheme for the wedding was easy   all white everything! I wanted the look to be elegant, classic and timeless but also contemporary and fresh. I wanted the inside of the reception room to be a white wonderland with flowers galore and the furniture to be sleek, white and contemporary with a lounge feel. The venue was easy because we had so many memories there, we got engaged there and most importantly it was in my hometown, which was important to me.'
p4843
aS'We had a very traditional Catholic ceremony. We got married at St. John Fisher Parish, which was the church I grew up going to. A few years ago the church decided to build a brand new parish and we were the first couple to be married in the new church. The ceremony was also very meaningful to us because the priest who performed the ceremony (Father Julio Giulietti) is a good friend of our family and married my parents 29 years ago.'
p4844
aS'The reception was special because it just looked breathtaking. There was an overwhelming amount of white flowers (hydrangeas and orchids   my favorite), which set the mood. The band (Rembrant) was the biggest hit of the night and kept the party going and our guests dancing. The first dance was special to us because we danced to  Cinema  the same song Quintan played when he proposed. The best part was just having all of our closets friends and family in the same place at the same time. I wanted a simple, sleek all white wedding cake accented by a few white flowers. I liked the square shape because I thought it looked a little more modern. The cake was vanilla beach and made by Vanilla Bakeshop.'
p4845
aS'We also had a groom s cake, which is more of a southern tradition. The cake was chocolate peanut butter and was hunting themed. One of Quintan s favorite hobbies is duck hunting and he has a hunting dog   a labrador retriever named Jade   who goes with him. The groom s cake was a tribute to Quintan and to Texas. On the top of the cake there was a chocolate lab with a duck in his mouth. Quintan loved it!'

S'One day, focused on two sweet souls and their love for one another. That s what this endearing San Francisco City Hall elopement from Coco Tran is all about. It embraces the quieter moments, the soft smiles of anticipation and deep affection these two beautiful people have for each other. And let s face it, when you top that all off with a stunning bow-front Vera Wang dress? It s a complete package of love.'

aS'From Coco Tran A beautiful a special elopement between two of the sweetest souls. Bessie and Dean are two of the most endearing and fun loving human beings I ve ever met. They are both young yet share so much love, joy, and wisdom about love. I have asked Dean and Bessie why they have decided to elope in the city hall instead of planning an large and elaborate wedding as they were first planning to, Dean graciously said to me,   We feel that the marriage is more important than the wedding  .\n'

S'Elegant garden weddings are pure magic to me. They just seem to blend everything I love most about weddings effortlessly into an evening I could stare at all day long. And when We Heart Photography is behind the lens, doing so is extra enjoyable. Join me here.'
p4951
aS'The DIY projects were out of control (I blame, yet praise Pinterest). I made all of the signs around the venue, which was time-consuming, but so worth it. I created my own stencils with the chosen fonts of our wedding and used chalkboard markers on every piece. The ribbon wands took the most effort. After the idea was given to me by our wedding coordinator, Greg Sack, I decided to make them on my own. Over 100 white-painted dowels and black and gold sequin ribbon spools later, I had made the perfect take-home gift for guests and a unique way to exit the ceremony with my new husband. I also made the fabric garland that hung in front of the stonehouse. I made it the day before the wedding and was ready to throw it in the trash if it looked less than perfect, but it worked like a charm! If you asked my husband what DIY he remembers, he ll remember bringing me endless Starbucks drinks as I sat on my living room floor jamming out project after project.'
p4952
aS'My favorite moment was seeing Elias at the end of the aisle. My heart could have beat right out of my chest. His adorable hands covered his face. Everyone watched, yet I felt like it was only us looking at each other. We decided not to text/call/Instagram anything from after the rehearsal dinner until to moment we saw each other down the aisle. My stomach was in knots all night. The moment we saw each other again was like being reunited with my best friend after missing him for what felt like months. All of the weeks of preparation were for this moment. God s presence was so tangible to me, and it was the most incredible feeling to see my almost husband looking at me for the first time as his almost wife.'
p4953
aS'Advice Don t communicate the night before the wedding. My favorite moment of the best day of our lives was thanks to our decision to do this. It was so hard, but so incredibly worth it. Take the last night before your married and celebrate with your bridesmaids, sisters, mother, or family. It makes the night special in so many ways. Don t sweat the small stuff. As easy as it is to be frustrated that the best man has drank enough for the entire bridal party, it s not worth the stress and drama. Be flexible and in moments of anxiety, turn to your new husband. They tend to be wound a little less tightly on the Big Day, so they have wedding day advice gems (like Eli:  Chlo, today is all about us. They re having a great time. That s exactly what we wanted this night to be: fun). Cherish every moment. From the flower girl wearing the wrong color shoes to your best friend breaking out the Ray Bans for his rendition of  Gangnam Style , you ll want to soak it all in. As stressful as the day can be, let the stress melt into memories. When it comes down to it, the day is all about you and your brand new hubby. Kiss when you want to kiss. Dance together until the last song plays. Take a huge deep breath and look at the view around you, because it goes by all to quickly.'

S'You ve seen the ice bucket challenges taking over social media, but this morning we re sharing the real ALS story of Adam and Hollie. They met as nurse and patient, but somewhere between weekly treatments and Adam s eventual diagnosis they managed to fall in love. What happens next is one of the most beautiful, touching, wildly inspiring weddings captured by Liz Wang Photography,and a true reminder that love conquers all.'
p4988
aS'From the Bride I am a nurse, Adam was a patient. It all started from there. As Adam was normal and healthy as can be, I never really noticed him until this strong, handsome man walked in our office door pushing a wheelchair. Ever since that appointment, I was assigned to his case to start biweekly treatments in an exam room for 3-hours a day, every week for a year. Yes, you tend to get to know a person rather well seeing them that often! His smile, laugh, and frequent  courtship  poetry is what made me fall in love. At first we were treating Lyme Disease, but my heart and mind were telling me otherwise. Once I finally got Adam on board, we went to one of the top Neurologist in UCLA. Our end diagnosis   ALS. He tells me right then and there,  I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want my last days seeing your face, kissing your lips, sleeping by your side. I understand if you don t  want this burden on you. But if you want me, I want to marry YOU. What do you say?  With tears coming down my face,  I wouldn t want it any other way, Yes, I want to take care of you and make sure you get the best care possible.  '
p4989
aS'We set out and even though the dark ALS cloud was above us every waking moment, we had one positive thing to look forward to   our wedding day. Adam and I made dual decisions on everything. He was just as involved as I was. From the venue, to flowers, to our photographers, down to my wedding dress, he was there. I fell in love with my dress as I drove by Camarillo Bridal s window. When I told Adam, he immediately said,  Let s go!  Adam came with me to my dress fitting. He is the only person I want approval from. I want to make sure he fell in love with it as much as I did. I wanted to see his face the minute I had that dress on, and of course, his smile was from ear to ear.'
p4990
aS'Our venue was another game changing aspect. I love the beach, and he loved the woods. We both knew a wheelchair was going to be necessary for the wedding. He dreaded that, as we even looked into renting a standing  wheelchair. But that was out of the question. As there was no such thing as renting one and if we bought one, it would have only been for it s one time use. A beach wedding was a complete  No  from Adam as he always called the beach,  A big ol  ashtray!  Having a wheelchair on a beach would only draw more attention to him as well and he didn t want that. So we both agreed on a woodsy theme and Walnut Grove was chosen. '
p4991
aS'That day was the best day ever. I never thought I would have a beautiful wedding, but every detail was perfect. The venue even had a brick walkway from the ceremony area to the reception area. They were right next to each other too! There was a linoleum dance floor and a dirt path that was kept clean so not every rock or stone gave Adam speed bumps as he whizzed by greeting every one in his wheel chair upon each person s entrance.After our ceremony, my cousin surprised us by making a handmade wooden sign. It was hung on the back of his wheelchair. It read,   Just married.  As we walked down the aisle as husband and wife, that first snapshot was the best. Our son holding my right hand and my left on his wheelchair. It was priceless. '
p4992
aS'Our first dance was one to remember by all as well. I delicately sat on his lap, one arm around the headrest of his wheel chair and my head on his chest. I kept whispering in his ear,  Don t go too fast or I ll fall ok? That would be so embarrassing!  He said,  I would never let you fall   We giggled we danced in circles for about 1 minute to our wedding song, In my Life  by The Beatles. At the end of the night, we both were as happy as can be, and I promise you, ALS was on our mind the whole day, but Adam s words played out in my mind and I ll never forget it.  I may have ALS, but God knows  I m going out with a BANG! '

He teamed up with  Kylie Swanson  +  Poppy Lane Design  and  One True Love Vintage Rentals    for a shoot inspired by the raw beauty of the ocean and the most stunning silver gown by  Carol Hannah. Glamour and the wild beauty of the beach are an unstopable combo. See it here.'
p5035
aS'Styling countless beautiful pieces in such a breathtakingly beautiful location just outside of San Francisco was quite the dream. Brett Heidebrecht effortlessly captured each and every detail to perfection and Poppy Lane Design took my breath away with her magical floral creations. The MVP of this shoot undoubtedly went to the team at One True Love Vintage Rentals, who happily hauled such spectacular (and heavy) treasures into some not-so-easy to reach spots. I was blessed to work alongside such an incredibly talented team of vendors, one that any bride would be lucky to have on her wedding day.\n'

S'When you ve got an absolutely stunning Olympic gold medalist and a handsome NBA player for the Bride & Groom, and you pair them up with Marisa Nicole Events at one of the prettiest places in Malibu, Cypress Sea Cove? The results are bound to be gorgeous. Andrew Abajian captured an amazing (read: out of this world) film that had me in tears and left me with a swoon-y smile, and Iris and Light gracefully set those moments still with their imagery. See it here.'
p5085
aS'From Marisa Nicole Events Lauren & Jrue are a match made in heaven! He is an NBA player for the New Orleans Pelicans, she is an Olympic gold medalist and professional women s soccer player, and together they are two of the kindest people on earth.'
p5086
aS'For  the look  of Lauren & Jrue s day, we set out to design a naturally elegant, coastal affair that felt comfortable for their friends and family. As the backdrop for these love-bird s vows, with the ocean on one side and guests on the other, Lauren & Jrue stood at the foot of a simply adorned cross where they made their love legal in the eyes of both God and California. We utilized long wooden banquet tables, paired with wooden vineyard chairs, and a simple lace to create the base for our dining area. Lauren just loved the look of super neutral flowers featuring pops of the colors that were already on the property (pale pinks, peaches, magenta and purple). We used soft, ruffled blooms, clean orchids and candles galore on the to create a sense of  easy romantic elegance  through the table-scape. Hung from trees and tucked in every nook and cranny of the venue, we utilized lanterns to give the party an enchanting feel once the sun had set. One of my favorite areas was the luxe lounge, which we housed in an open wooden cabana under a ceiling of twinkle lights. It was just gorgeous!'
p5087
aS'Lauren s family got involved with executing the day of aesthetic details as well! Lauren s mom and sister put together sweet treats for the guests to take home. Lauren & Jrue love lemon drops, so they filled mini mason jars with the candy, attached a tag and voil  , a fab favor that brought pops of yellow to the table-scape. Lauren ??s brother-in-law did all the chalkboard art! Along with the overall look of the day, the cuisine was very important to these lovebirds. Lauren & Jrue love soul food and wanted to bring a touch of southern flair to their celebration. During cocktail hour, we served catfish tacos, mini crab cakes and fried chicken & biscuit bites. Dinner was served family style and all the old picnic favorites were present: barbecue short ribs, stuffed chicken, mac & cheese, cornbread, okra, sweet potato bites; yum!'
p5088
aS'Neither Lauren nor Jrue drink alcohol, so along with a full bar for the guests, we wanted to do something special for the couple. They are crazy about lemonade, so with a sweet gazebo as the backdrop, we founded a lemonade stand in their honor, featuring three specialty flavors for guests of all ages to enjoy. The couple also wasn ??t into the idea of a traditional wedding cake; so we said,  forget the cake   and brought in the best pies we could find in the whole of the state. The couple cut warm peach pie instead of cake and the guests went crazy over all the a la mode pie options!'
p5089
aS'The couple, with their friends & family, danced the night away under a ceiling of bistro lights, hanging lanterns and stars, slowing down only to pop into the photo booth for a quick selfie! A good time and good eats were had by all at Lauren & Jrue s oceanside, southern romantically elegant f te!\n'

p5128
aS'From the beautiful  Bride ?   The moment we walked into the Villa San Juan Capistrano, we knew that we had to get married there. The venue was so serene, with its enclosed courtyard and sweet chapel. The perfect place for a peony-infused garden party.'
p5129
aS'As we thought about planning our wedding, we wanted the day to be a celebration of love. Not just our love, but the love and support of the family and friends who would celebrate with us. As such, we tried to incorporate personal touches. Jeff s dad officiated the ceremony and his mom hand stitched the pillows that were laid around the venue. My family helped to make much of the decor, including the seating chart and chalkboard-like drink menus. A piece of my grandmother s wedding dress was wrapped around my bouquet, and on the inside of the cottage we displayed our family members  wedding photos.'
p5130
aS'One of our favorite memories occurred just as dinner was winding down. Jeff and I sat at a sweetheart table in the corner of the courtyard, and we looked out at our guests, then at each other, and took a moment to take it all in. We were married! We were so grateful for these wonderful people who chose to celebrate with us. It was such a feeling of joy!'

S'I d be willing to bet my bottom dollar that this wedding goes down as a SMP favorite. For starters, it s the work of Marcy Blum and Nancy Liu Chin (aka, some of the best in the biz) with Stephanie Pool behind the lens. From the bright pink petals down the aisle to the statement bridesmaids  dresses, it s a risk-taking spin on traditional elegance that paid off BIG time. Get started in the gallery and don t miss the film from AwesomeShot Studios.'
p5186
aS'From Marcy Blum Associates Planning this wedding for one of my dearest friends  children (we have been friends for over 45 years) of course held a very special meaning for me. I ve known the bride and her siblings before they were born, and not having kids of my own, they are my surrogates.'
p5187
aS'Dana was raised in Palo Alto and now lives with her husband (Rob is from New York) in New York City where her mother, father, and I were raised. The bride and I have very similar taste and style and we lean towards the  fabulous  much to her mother s chagrin.'
p5188
aS'One of the challenges for me was to imbue the very elegant but rather masculine and definitely  clubby  Sharon Heights Golf and Country Club with some NYC glitz and glam without eradicating the wonderful California aura that Dana and her family are very attached to. The Club is also a venue that many of the guests are quite familiar with and I wanted to turn it into something that felt very different and very festive to them as well. I would be remiss if I didn t mention that the banquet manager Helen Engelherdt (from ny of course :) was 100% with me on this project and made it far easier than it would have been otherwise. We served cocktails and hors d oeuvres before the ceremony so that we didn ??t impinge on any members golfing time when we finally set up.'
p5189
aS'The ceremony on the golf course (an outdoor ceremony was the one non-negotiable from the bride) began with Beach Boy songs performed by an acapella group and continued with a classical ensemble. After the ceremony performed by a friend of the couple, guests entered the ballroom from a different direction than usual. Guests were literally stopped in their tracks by the transformation of the club s dining room. Using long tables, custom gossamer and gold linens, clever lighting and hanging crystals and blooms from the existing chandeliers,our team had rendered the club ballroom even to those who are there often, unrecognizable.'
p5190
aS'A fabulous band after dinner was followed by a DJ in the sexy club we had built in the bar.'
p5191
aS'The entire weekend, starting with a Mexican tasting dinner in Palo Alto hosted by the grooms  parents and ending with an around the pool farewell brunch at the bride s parent s home, was really the perfect melding of wonderful ideas and guests from east and west coasts, exactly as I had wished for.\n'

S'The perfect mix of elegant and intimate, this San Francisco wedding at the Clift Hotel is sophisticated yet sweet. With beautiful all white florals from Erica Rose Design, perfectly edited details by And Something Blue and stunning photography from Vivian Chen Photography - this gallery simply shouldn t be missed. '
p5239
aS'From the Bride The vision for the wedding was something chic and sophisticated, yet intimate. Chris and I met and live in San Francisco, so we wanted the wedding to in the city, in a venue that was indoor, but special. When we saw the Spanish Suite of the Clift Hotel, it almost felt as if it were custom made for our wedding. Between the warm redwood, the sparkling chandeliers and the Philippe Starck chair covers, it was absolutely gorgeous. The fact that it opened onto a tented patio that overlooked the lights of downtown San Francisco made it truly perfect.'
p5240
aS'We thought the best way to complement this beautiful space was with simple all-white flowers. The baby s breath garland on the mantle was a highlight dramatic, yet soft and lacy. We also added personal touches throughout the wedding, such as my late grandmother s handkerchiefs for  happy tears , signature cocktails, and personalized menus. One of my best friends is an artist and graphic designer, so we were lucky enough to have her do all the signage and invitations. The room felt so elegant, and yet so warm, which is exactly what we wanted for our 65 guests.'
p5241
aS'My favorite moment of the night was just looking at Chris  face while we were getting married it was actually glowing. It really hit me then how lucky I was to be marrying this man! We worked thoughtfully on customizing the ceremony with our officiant, and it was so special and just felt so right for us. It was truly a magical night.\n'

S'If ever there were a wedding that could rock a whole lot of glamour with a hint of edge, it would surely be of former Guns N  Roses and current Velvet Revolver drummer, Matt Sorum and his stunning Bride, Ace Harper. Can we just take a look at her top knot? Paired with her sleek Monique Lhuillier dress, it s perfection. It s one of our favorite Michael Segal weddings to date. See the full party in the gallery!'
p5289
aS'From Michael Segal Photography  Guns N Roses and Velvet Revolver drummer Matt Sorum, tied the knot with his gorgeous fiance, singer and dancer Ace Harper. The couple exchanged vows at the Colony Palms Hotel in Palm Springs, California in front of 200 guests, which included Jane Lynch, Juliette Lewis, John Varvatos, Gina Gershon and Duff McKagan among others. John Varvatos designed Sorum s tux and suits for the groomsmen, and Monique Lhuillier designed the dresses for Harper and her bridesmaids. Ace was adorned in diamonds from Alan Friedman designs Beverly Hills.'
p5290
aS'Wedding planned by Joey from Artisan Events who also did the flowers. The three day affair began with cocktails and Hors d oeuvre by the pool with a French Brazilian Jazz trio, playing everything from Bossa Nova to Miles Davis, and a video of the bride and groom doing their own rendition of the Sonny and Cher s classic,  I Got You Babe .'
p5291
aS'The following day, the wedding began as the guests watched the wedding party procession enter to classical renditions of The Beach Boy s  God Only Knows , and The Verve s  Bittersweet Symphony . The bride walked down the aisle to The Beatles classic,  All You Need Is Love . Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple brought everyone to tears with his own rendition of  You Are So Beautiful . As the bride and groom kissed, hummingbirds flew around the grounds in harmony.'
p5292
aS'The bridal party then headed to the famous desert windmills for photos with photographer, Michael Segal. The reception kicked off with an unforgettable first dance from Matt and Ace, to Billy Idol s  White Wedding  with Billy Idol s guitarist, Steve Stevens looking on. The dance was choreographed by famed choreographer, Jennifer Hamilton. Chef Jeff Armstrong created the six-course sit down dinner, which included faro risotto, halibut, goat cheese truffle ravioli, and a massive dessert table with 300 cupcakes and other custom delights. As guests dined, Aqualillies synchronized swimmers performed in the pool.'
p5293
aS'The best man and matron of honor toasted the newlyweds with Belaire Rose Champagne. The party then headed to the Purple Palm for a set by DJ Morty. The bride and groom gave a heartfelt thank you to their guests, and a special poem was read to Ace written by Matt. An all-star jam began with Rockstars Present, as Gilby Clarke, Duff McKagan, Steven Stevens, Glenn Hughes and Matt (on drums) took the stage. The bride looking ever so stunning in her wedding dress, took over the vocals on the Led Zeppelin classic,  Rock n  Roll  and the Stones  Jumping Jack Flash . Juliette Lewis also stepped up to sing  Proud Mary,  and Gina Gershon sang one as well.'

aS'From Jessica, the bride  Darrel and I met in collage where he was studying to become an athletic trainer and I was playing on the softball team. After numerous visits to the schools athletic training facility in my dirt and sweat covered uniform, we both recognized that there was something unique and special about the other. It wasn ??t long after that we stared dating, fell in love, and started the adventure of a lifetime together.'
p5329
aS'My inspiration for our wedding came from Anthropologie, with a little less boho and a little more chic. Our wedding embraced the natural beauty of the venue with an added punch of color and sparkle. I wanted the design to look eclectic yet cohesive. One of my favorite touches to the wedding was having our ring bearer nephews walk doing the aisle with a teddy bear and baseball glove. The teddy bear signifying our love for animals, and the baseball glove signifying my background of playing softball and Darrel ??s playing baseball.'
p5330
aS'Darrel and I chose to wait until the ceremony to see each other, however, it was important to us that we would be able to pray together prior to that moment. Therefore, we set up a prayer where we could hold hands and speak to each other on either sides of a door. It was such a special and calming moment for me to have my soon-to-be husband lead us in prayer as we embarked on this exciting lifelong journey together.'
p5331
aS'I always envisioned myself walking down the aisle to a soft, acoustic song with meaningful lyrics. Divine Romance by Phil Wickham came on while Darrel and I were driving together and we knew right away that it was the perfect processional song choice for our wedding. Our recessional song was Sweetest Thing by U2, a favorite band of Darrel ??s. Our first dance song was the easiest wedding decision that we had to make, Everything by Michael Bubl  . This has been  ??our ?? song since the day we first started dating and has stuck with us ever since.'

aS'From Caroline Yoon Fine Art Photography  Stephanie and Brian s intimate and elegant wedding was nothing short of perfection. They were wed surrounded by their closest friends and family at a private residence in Napa Valley, California. Their wedding day was truly a collaboration of talented friends and family who offered up their talents for the florals, the wedding cake, and many other thoughtful details. It was a beautiful, honest, and heartfelt wedding, and I feel special to have been a part of it.\n'

And thanks to the beautiful work of Grace Song of Charis Events & Design, The Butter End Cakery and Butterfly Floral, I d say  mission accomplished.  See every moment in the gallery from AndySeo Studio.'

aS'From the Bride.. It was a typical late night after work on 2010 when I first met Zoo, now my husband. I was working as a chef at London West Hollywood hotel, and after cooking for exhausting 10 hours, my co-worker and I could not help the late night munchies. Usually, this late night munchies are evil, but I say this one was the opposite since it led me to meet my husband, who was a good friend of my co-worker and was fighting the munchies just like us! My co-worker called Zoo out and we ended up having drinks/snacks together. In fact, nothing happened that night. I only remember the meal was just good and Zoo was wearing a red beanie, which I was like,  what the  . No one, even my co-worker, this night would be the beginning of everything. We didn t know why, but we found we hung out each other more often since that accidental, but destined night.'
p5401
aS'Our love started growing somewhere in our heart.I became his fiance on the night of Christmas eve. He decorated his room with an arch and light balls, and kneeled down with a little tears. Sure, he recorded everything with his  hidden  video camcorder. We had about a year and a half engagement to have enough time for the one and only wedding prep!'
p5402
aS'I am a huge fan of Disney since I was a child, so I always wanted to have my wedding like the ones in fairytales. One day, I got to see the movie,  Twilight  wedding scenes, and that was it! Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, CA was a just perfect outdoor venue with rustic barn aura and so much trees and plants. Especially, we loved and picked Ranch House since it also gave us much room to decorate to my exactly wanted theme.'
p5403
aS'Our wedding planner, Grace Song (CEO of Charis event & Design), there is no way our wedding could have been the spectacular day it was without her. It is not just the organization, it is the consultation and conversations prior that relieved my stress and helped me prepare for the day. She had ideas that elevated mine. We need someone like Grace to rein it all in, and figure out the details that your brain could not comprehend. She is the expert, and it shows. Nothing seems to faze her. We are truly blessed to have her as our coordinator for our wedding. And our photographer, Andy Seo Photography, one of the best decision we made for our wedding.We cannot say enough great things about Andy and his photography team. '

aS'From the Bride  Looking back, I m a little embarrassed that I didn t dress up more. It was my close friend s Super Bowl party, so what was the need? Little did I know my life would change forever after that Sunday. When I arrived I was greeted by many familiar faces. I settled in to watch the game, but mostly chat with my girlfriends. I noticed the unfamiliar face walk in immediately. I was introduced to Tom by an old friend telling me Tom was his newly single roommate. He smiled and casually introduced himself to the group. He was cute, really cute. But as quickly as he said hello, he quietly slipped out of the circle.  Well, so much for talking to the cute guy,  I thought. For the rest of the game, our only interactions were when we shimmied past each other in the hallway or chatting with the group. However, at some point, and sadly I can t remember exactly how, what was a group of five or six telling stories about their weekend, Tom and I were left alone talking and laughing. I was shocked. I wasn t shocked that we were speaking directly to each other; I was shocked at how comfortable I was talking to him. I went from hanging out with five of my lifelong friends to speaking to someone I d only know a few minutes and yet somehow I felt like I had known him my whole life. We did the predictable background Q&A and quickly discovered that we grew up less than 15 minutes from each other, had countless friends in common and shared numerous interests. Sadly, as great as the conversation was going, my ride was leaving so I said it was nice to meet him and gave him a moment to ask for my number. He promptly filled the moment with,  It was nice to meet you too. Hope you get home safe.  With that, Tom walked away. Needless to say I was disappointed and immediately blamed my casual Super Bowl attire. Like any party, leaving isn t fast. My thoughts of disappointment were erased with an,  Umm, hey,  from behind. I turned to see Tom standing there. In a cute, but nervous voice he said  Umm, so do you want to hang out sometime?  I played it cool,  Sure . Tom let out a great big smile but in a sarcastic tone, which I would grow to love, replied with,  Well, how about I give you my number, that way when you change your mind you don t have to deal a weird stalker? '
p5456
aS' Over the next week Tom and I exchanged text messages and set up a time for our first date the following Monday. We met at a bar in West Los Angeles at 6pm for a few drinks, because we both had work the next day. Before I knew it, my stomach was sore from laughing and the bar was closing. Our first date flew by in an instant much like the next four years of our lives. We spent holidays together, took vacations together, and eventually moved to San Francisco together. As is true for most adults in their late 20s, life is hectic. Our one spot to slow down was Tom s family s ranch in Paso Robles, Spring Ranch. Tom grew up spending weekends and summers on the ranch and showed me his deep love of it. Growing up a country fan, this was a match made in heaven and I quickly shared his deep seeded love for the ranch. It was on the ranch where Tom proposed to me, and on the ranch where we held our wedding reception.'
p5457
aS' With over a year to plan, Tom and I wanted to be meticulous with every step we took. It was a no-brainer choosing Spring Ranch as our venue for the reception, as it was such a special place for us and Tom s family had hosted numerous weddings and events there. However, beyond that we were unsure. After doing extensive research and meeting with multiple wedding coordinators we were ecstatic when Percy Sales agreed to be our coordinator. The foundation of his vision was the same as ours, yet he brought so much experience and creativity that he was able to create something far more incredible than we could have dreamt. Everything Percy organized met our wish of an elegant country wedding. From the food, flowers and music to the table settings, lighting and countless other details; it was an absolute dream.'
p5458
aS' With the day upon us, guests boarded shuttles in Paso Robles for a short ride through wine country to a small and stunning chapel located on the neighboring ranch. The chapel was perched on top of a hill overlooking fields of wheat and grape vines. The ceremony featured a small string quartet and was held early in the evening as temperatures in May can be quite high. After the ceremony our guests boarded the waiting shuttles for a quick ten minute drive up the canyon to Spring Ranch.'
p5459
aS' Upon arrival to the reception location, our guests were greeted by the ranch s horses grazing next to the shuttle drop-off. We wanted our cocktail hour to have a strong country theme. We were fortunate enough to book the SLOPokes, a great, local bluegrass band to perform for our guests. As the sun was setting our guests proceeded to our tented and beautifully lit dining area followed by our entrance. After an amazing meal featuring local fare, the real party began. Urged on by the amazing band, The Wonder Bread 5, we all danced long into the evening. Besides the incredible country views one of the great things Spring Ranch offers is no curfew. With dinner not starting until 8:30 the band didn t take the stage until 10:00 and played for two hours. After the band stopped a DJ continued as the first shuttle departed. We danced and drank until our last bus departed at 1am. For late night snacks we featured mini sliders, French fries and grass-fed Spring Ranch beef jerky. Throughout this amazing evening our incredible photographer, Anna Costa, subtly managed to be in the right place at the right time to capture every special moment. Her work was priceless as the evening was so incredible that it flew bye in a flash.'
p5460
aS' Since our May 2013 wedding, Tom and I have moved back down to the Pasadena area, adopted a dog, purchased a house and began new jobs. No matter how much things have changed since we first met four years ago, we still often find ourselves at 2am with aching smiles and asking what happened to the last 8 hours? Our dog thinks we re crazy.'

S'I once wrote in an interview that my dream wedding would feel like a dinner party. Twinkle lights in the trees, dancing to the classic. Good food, great wine and a sense of family built into every detail. And this wedding, is that dream personified. With photography by Erich McVey, design & planning by XOXO Bride and florals by Kelly Kaufman, this wedding is everything. More right here.'
p5513
aS'We found our wedding coordinator, Sonia Hopkins, through the Inn, and from the minute I said,  I dunno, like Downton Abby at an outdoor picnic,  she turned a mirage of an idea into an amazing reality. We wanted elegant but not stuffy, refined but relaxed. So we set a gorgeous table then served the meal in French service fashion, with the sides on the table family style.'
p5514
aS'We built the colors off of the natural beauty of the Herb Garden, greens and whites, sprinkled with lavender and peach. As we are both from English heritage, we stayed with that theme as we jumped out of the box with our band, The Brit Pack, who played all British music ranging from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin. As fun to work with as they were to listen to, we are still getting asked where we found them.'
p5515
aS'Lastly, our photographer, Erich McVey, gave us the perfect pictures to remember our perfect day. But the best thing about Erich and his wife is that, even though they were there, they still made that special  just married  time between the ceremony and reception feel like it was only the two of us. Our wedding was more than we could have ever thought possible, all from one very lucky choice to take a drive one day to Ojai.'

S'They say opposites attract. Take this bride for example   her style is all about modern simplicity. A subtle but gorgeous palette, a quiet nod to tradition and a sense of chic built into every detail. But then if you look closely   with photographs by Christine Choi   you see moments of pure whimsy that made the wedding entirely personal, entirely  them.  Click here for more.'
p5578
aS'From the Bride Our wedding theme is  modern romance  which is so me. I wanted my wedding to match with our personality, modern, simple, intimate, elegant, and romantic. We did not have much color in our wedding   only ivory, grey and a pop of yellow to create a modern look. From the invitations, the programs, the flowers, table numbers, and decoration we kept the palette consistent. '
p5579
aS'The wedding planning process was actually really fun for me. I DIY-ed most of the items, most of the decor, name cards, table numbers, and Mr. and Mrs Sign. Our wedding turned out fabulous, from our tradition Chinese tea ceremony, first look and wedding ceremony to our reception. It was not only a special day for us, it was one for all our friends and families.'

aS'From the bride We wanted to have a destination wedding so that we could extend the wedding celebrations and enjoy a full weekend of wedding festivities with our family and closest friends. Sonoma, California was a natural choice as Craig and I bonded over our mutual love and passion for great food and wine. We envisioned our wedding weekend filled with delicious meals and great local wines in a beautiful setting where everyone truly felt like a part of the celebration.'
p5661
aS'Craig and I are both foodies and much of our planning focused on the food and wine. Our inspiration was  French country    an homage to Paris where we were engaged   and we worked with an amazing team of vendors who helped bring our culinary vision to life!'
p5662
aS'This was a foodie wedding with a twist  I have celiac disease and cannot eat gluten, and both Craig and I are lactose intolerant; so it was important to us that our menu was inclusive of all dietary restrictions. We designed a menu that was gluten and dairy-free   including our wedding cake buffet! It was our big fat, gluten-free, dairy-free dream wedding.  Magical  was the word so many of our guests used to describe the weekend   and it was just that; we had our perfect ending.'

It s a combination that I ve come to call my very own dream wedding. Floral-robed  maids turned blush beauties, ivory bouquets dotted with peach from The Little Branch, signage galore and so much more. This stunner will surely brighten your Monday morn!'
p5701
aS'From Hazelnut Photography  Two people couldn t be more in sync with one another. It seems they ve been following each other for most of their lives. Now, they are next to one another, standing side by side, as they take on this new life adventure together! Michelle & Bryan went to rival high schools in Southern California, but didn t meet until they both ended up at Penn for college. They ve been together since their freshman year and finally tied the knot on Saturday!'
p5702
aS'These two, Michelle & Bryan, are so absolutely perfect for each other. Their wedding day will go down as one of my favorites, because it was so genuine. It seemed to be a perfect representation of them, as individuals and as a couple. They have a beautiful respect for one another, an immense love for their families and true admiration for their friends. It was an incredible day, full of love and laughter and I couldn t be more thrilled for the two of them!\n'

S'Close your eyes and imagine the loveliest garden wedding you ve ever come across. Now open up and be prepared for even more, because these charming California nuptials are just THAT pretty. Designed with a nod to the couple s love of cooking (read: herb-infused olive oil favors) it s classic romance with a personal spin and we ve got the whole gallery from Onelove Photography.'
p5739
aS'From the Bride  We both love being in the kitchen, so we wanted to incorporate our love of food and cooking into our wedding. After much discussion, we came up with the idea of infused olive oil with different herbs and spices that have special meaning. We had rosemary for faithfulness, love and remembrance; thyme for courage; sage for strength, chili to  spice things up , and garlic just because we love it!'
p5740
aS'We also had a lot of help from my little sister. One of the things I was set on was to hand address all of the invites, my handwriting however, is not the prettiest. She ended up doing all the calligraphy and the artwork on the invites, the name cards, the bar menu, the seating chart window, and the welcome window. She did an amazing job!'
p5741
aS'For us the most important thing was that our family and friends had a good time. We knew it would be a memorable night for us, but we also wanted it to be a memorable night for everyone else. As important as flowers and decor were, we also wanted it to be fun, that s where the photobooth and the glow sticks came in.'
p5742
aS'If you re going to DIY as much of your wedding as you can, START EARLY. The biggest thing was that we didn t realize how long these projects would take us. The marquee lights that we made took us over a period of 3 weeks, granted we only worked on them during the weekend, it was still 2 weeks longer than we had estimated. Otherwise, have fun and don t focus on little things that can t be changed.'
p5743
aS'For us, the highlight was seeing all of our friends and family out on the dance floor having the time of their lives. Both our parents and his grandparents adorned with glowsticks dancing and taking pictures in the photobooth. Knowing that people still talk about our wedding and how much fun they had means the world to us.\n'

S'This elopement is so up my alley. Gorgeous light, stunning images from This Love Of Yours Photography  and the San Francisco City Hall setting the scene   it really doesn t get any better. And then I read the Bride s description and realized I loved it even more, because it just proves that even when your big day doesn t go exactly as planned, the result is pretty darn fabulous. See even more here. '
p5778
aS'After much thought, we decided to elope at City Hall on October 31st. We planned our small intimate wedding with my immediate family at City Hall in 2 months and it turned out to be better than ever. My dad got certified to marry us and Igor s parents and sister were broadcasted in through a live Skype session from their home in Spain.'
p5779
aS' Oh and the details! You will melt at the sight of my oh so ethereal Badgley Mischka silk chiffon dress against the soft renaissance architecture of San Francisco City Hall. Igor s grey J.Crew Ludlow suit, the DIY bouquets (we made the day before the wedding with special thanks to our talented friend and fellow designer Michelle Pentz), DIY boutonnieres for each member of my family, my sisters the bridesmaids in J.Crew misty rose dresses and gold shoes, DIY terrarium place markers (from the Hello!Lucky Handmade Weddings book), Grandparent s china and linens from their wedding and great grandpa s glassware all beautifully styled by my wonderful Auntie Shelley and talented friend Lisa Feldman of Lisa Feldman Design, DIY gold sparkle monogram (from Paper Source and perfectly crafted by our dear friend and fellow DIY aficionado Lia Lafreniere), and our first look with Igor riding up on the Vespa. '
p5780
aS'I debated whether or not to throw in this story but it totally made our day have a little twist so I will tell you  And you are probably wondering why one of our wedding photos is taken with a couple of police officers.'
p5781
aS'We were outside taking photos and doing our thing with the wedding paparazzi, when I turned around to the sound of some people yelling and pointing at us. We looked behind us and my purse was gone! I left it sitting in Igor s helmet behind us and someone ran by and grabbed it. We didn t see who it was or anything. I was in shock. My passport, ID, credit card and iPhone were swept away. A group of French tourists came up to us and tried to explain what had happened. I didn t know what they were saying at all since I don t speak any French, but Igor was able to decipher a bit since he speaks a little. Igor thought to run across the street to the steps of City Hall where a protest was going on. There were a few police officers there. He quickly ran back to me and took me over to the police officers who then asked me for my apple ID and password. I typed it in and within seconds we saw a little red dot moving along the screen of the GPS. Since my phone was on, they were able to track it! I was able to get everything back, and we got a photo with the police officers. They arrested the woman who had stolen my precious belongings and asked if I wanted to press charges. I told them I did not want to press charges since we got everything back and the lady was notably less fortunate than us. We are so happy that everything got resolved as it renewed our belief in happy endings.'
p5782
aS'Every member of my family had a role in the planning of our big day and our friends helped with the DIY details. Everything, including Igor s toast that made me cry tears of joy, the  Moves Like Jagger  dance he did at our reception (as seen in the video), and the feeling of family and togetherness couldn t have been more perfect.\n'

Every ray of sunshine covering these two sweeties, every warm embrace and every romantic gaze. Set at the peaceful Pine Hills Lodge, the imagery paints a perfect picture of the joy and love that graced this day!'
p5812
aS'From Aga Jones Photography  The Julian venue was perfect for outdoor couple like Sarah & Chris. When I arrived there I could not believe how peaceful it was. Most wedding details were done DIY by the Bride, her sisters (who were also her beautiful bridesmaids), and her uncle who helped coordinate whole wedding day. The ceremony included their closest family and friends, they also jump the broom! The venue was the perfect background for bridal portraits and I am absolutely honored I was there to capture it and now share it with you.\n'

S'I love the little personal touches infused into weddings. It s those details that hit me the most. Take this Napa fete from Amazae Special Events and Jennifer Skog for instance. Not only did this adorable duo s love blossom in the fourth grade, but on top of that they had the Groom s brother officiate their ceremony, followed by the stowing away of their vows with a bottle of wine to be opened back up on their fifth anniversary. Now, how sweet is that? See the rest of this beautiful day right here.'
p5854
aS'From the beautiful Bride  The two of us have known each other for over twenty years, having met as children in the fourth grade of elementary school. Fast forward through a friendship that lasted throughout middle school, high school and college, we went our separate ways as life led him to Palo Alto and me to San Diego, 500 miles apart. We reconnected years later and things never felt more right. After six years of dating, three of which were long distance before I relocated to Palo Alto, he proposed to me while overlooking the ocean on a weekend getaway to beautiful Carmel.'
p5855
aS'Our fantastic event designer and planner, Crystal Lequang, helped us narrow venues down until we came to The Carneros Inn. We were smitten with its intimate feel and perfect balance of modern luxury and California chic. As evidenced by the fruit trees and vegetable gardens on the grounds, The Carneros Inn s restaurant, Farm, focuses on seasonal foods from the Napa Valley. Being lovers of our local markets and farms, this truly spoke to us and we were so excited to craft a memorable and delicious menu of our favorite foods and wines.'
p5856
aS'We dreamed of a personal, meaningful and classic wedding that wouldn t be overly formal; romantic yet masculine with a touch of elegance and a hint of the outdoors. We wanted to be mindful of the things that would make our guests feel at ease and a part of a warm celebration of our love. Oh, and of course, we wanted it to be a fabulously great time! We dove right into the details and decided on a palette of soft blushes, champagne, ivory and gold to be carried throughout the day. And there was no shortage of inspiration as we pulled from sources such as the venue s apple orchard, an extremely unique chair in the style of Louis XV that would become a part of the outdoor vignette, beautiful organically shaped gold charger plates, and even the details of my wedding gown.'
p5857
aS'Keeping in mind how we wished for the day to be personal and meaningful, we asked Toan s brother to officiate for us and decided to write the ceremony together with stories of our childhood meeting and hopes for the future. We also chose to write our vows and read them to each other amid both laughter and tears. A wine box ceremony wrapped things up where our vows were stowed away with a bottle of wine to be read and enjoyed on our fifth anniversary. After sealing our commitment with a kiss, we walked back up the aisle to a joyous rendition of  It Had To Be You  and led our guests on a parade through the resort among the fruit trees and cottages and began the celebration.'
p5858
aS'I loved every single moment of the day, but if I had to choose some highlights I would include: reading my vows to my oldest, dearest friend; feeling overjoyed to be surrounded by our loved ones when we were all seated for dinner; the phenomenal same-day-edit video that was shown, and our first dance. Since I would be the first to admit to having two left feet, we decided to take lessons and had a simple choreographed routine to  Dream a Little Dream of Me  that was sweet and a little playful. Toan would be sure to add that some of his highlights were the awesome band that played covers of his favorite Journey songs, the Vespa that not only served up scoops of gelato but was the perfect photo op, and the very popular late night bites of sliders and grilled cheeses after all that dancing!'
p5859
aS'Our wedding day was full of happiness and the moments were sincerely us. We are thankful for our nearest and dearest who attended, and of course, our amazing team of vendors. They are all so exceedingly talented, completely genuine and brought so much heart to the day and helped us create extraordinary memories. Toan and I could not be more grateful.\n'

S'When I see the words  ranch wedding  there s a certain image that comes to mind. And while we love our rustic weddings dearly, this bride did it on her own terms without a mason jar or speck of burlap in sight. She opted for modern black and white stripes with pops of gold, and along with the help of Vanessa Noel, Sweet Memories and Anna Delores embodies what the SMP wedding is all about.'
p5904
aS'From Vanessa Noel Events  Ariana and Taylor s wedding was one filled with tribute to their families, their heritages, and to their faith. Ariana s father, like so many in California s Central Valley, is a farmer. Ariana grew up on a dairy in the middle of hundreds of acres of almond trees so it only made sense that she and Taylor would get married in her hometown church with a reception on a ranch. But Ariana didn t want the details that we ve come to expect from a ranch wedding no burlap, lace or chippy paint here. Ariana wanted a classic, elegant style that she knew she d love for years to come.'
p5905
aS'We put together a palette of black and white, with lots of gold touches and beautiful, lush greenery to bring in the perfect nod to Taylor s Irish roots and the March wedding date. Crisp black and white stripes brought sophistication to the decor while flowing garlands added soft romance and just the right touch of  country. '
p5906
aS'Specialty linens, all-white lounge furniture, and an escort card display of mirrors brought glamor to the rustic venue. The tulips in the centerpieces, the stroopwafel (wafer cookie) favors, and the horse and buggy were all tributes to Ariana s Dutch heritage. In fact, Ariana s parents rode on the very same horse and buggy (owned by a local Dutch family) when they were married over 20 years ago!\n'

From Amorology and Twigg Botanicals behind the sweet decor of this day, including the bell and bloom-adorned birch ceremony backdrop and the deliciously peach and blush bouquets, and vintage pretties from Found Vintage Rentals scattered about, every turn is a delight to our wedding-loving eyes. See it all in the gallery from Swoon By Katie!'
p6009
aS'From Amorology  Shortly after Scott Lembke proposed to his darling bride Mia Deterding, their friends quickly coined them  The Lem-dingers  and their new mash up name seemed to be ringing with inspiration. We set out to create a  Lemdinger  of a day for our sweet duo with antiquated bells and rustic romantic touches among a gorgeous country setting.'
p6010
aS'Mia and Scott were wed under a birch, bloom and bell structure that we created in collaboration with Twigg Botanicals while guests waved ribbon wands of mini bells at the conclusion of their ceremony to celebrate.'
p6011
aS'Following cocktail hour and lawn games, the dinner bell was wrung and invited guests to wash up at our water basin station and escort card display where each person was given their own tea towel and table assignment. Table names perched in cut birch logs were named after various flowers with the description of their meaning such as Camellia, which in the language of flowers means  longing for you  and the California Poppy which means  Sweet Dreams  or the Lily of the Valley that means  you complete me .'
p6012
aS'Guests were favored with homemade strawberry jam by our bride with tied tags that read  the more the berrier . In exchange, guests left hand-written letters and memories to Mia and Scott that they tucked into old wood mail slots. After dinner, the party took to the dance floor, while some cuddled by the fire in warm handmade quilts by the bride. It was an evening as comfortable and warm as the two of them, filled with the kindest of people and a love that we know will last a lifetime!\n'

It s French countryside by way of Sonoma captured in such a pretty way by Jose Villa. With layered neutrals, hand-crafted signage and wildly elegant flowers and garland designed by Flower Wild and planned by Rosemary Events  this talented bunch has made some serious magic.'
p6075
aS'From Rosemary Hattenbach of Rosemary Events   Marilyn & Spencer came to me in search of the perfect intimate, European style setting for a French inspired wedding. We found it in a charming Sonoma villa on a beautiful 75 acre Sonoma Ranch and designed a wedding for them celebrating all their favorite things   all things French.'
p6076
aS'Their hilltop ceremony was at a lookout at the top of the ranch with views of the surrounding countryside. Marilyn arrived in a vintage Rolls Royce. Kate Holt from Flowerwild added the finishing touches to the already gorgeous setting with loosely grouped herbs tied with silk ribbon streamers on the aisle. Garlands of Pittosborum lined the path. Framing the couple on either side of the stage were large baskets spilling with clematis, bridal veil, spirea, garden roses and other various blooms.'
p6077
aS'Afterwards, the couple led a procession down the hill to the home where the reception was held. On arrival guests sipped champagne and enjoyed a selection of artisan cheeses and charcuterie while listening to the sounds of Ever Music Jazz ensemble. The delicious French inspired meal was prepared by Ramekins, Sonoma and featured many of Marilyn & Spencer s favorites.'
p6078
aS'Guests dined on a beautiful stone patio set beneath towering redwoods where they were seated at long wood tables. The area was lit with stringer lights and tons of candlelight. Gorgeous white florals and caramel roses were set on a burlap runner that was laid over a layer of very loosely woven cheesecloth on the wood tables for a softer more feminine feel.'
p6079
aS'At each place setting ceramic coupe chargers were graced with a white & taupe grain sack striped napkin from La Tavola Linen. Atop the napkin was a  taupe on white letterpressed  menu and a singular bloom of garden rose. At each guests  seat was a hand calligraphed place card in the form of a mini butcher paper scroll that wrapped around the stem of the wine glass.'
p6080
aS'A French wine riddling rack from Chateau Sonoma was filled with floral and little butcher paper cones for guests to drop well wishes for bride and groom'
p6081
aS'When guests came back into the house for dancing, the room was a glow with amazing candelabras. A beautiful dessert station & wedding cake by Sweet on Cake offered a sweet finish to the meal. Marilyn even arranged a surprise Guittard Hot Chocolate station for Spencer so he could indulge in his favorite after dinner treat. The couple kicked off the dancing with  Let it be Me  by Ray La Montagne and didn t stop dancing until the bitter end. It was a gorgeous evening.\n'

S'From a ukelele serenaded proposal to a vintage secret garden-inspired soiree that took place at the Groom s childhood home, this L.A. affair is enchanting to say the least. Designed by the ultimate DIY Bride and now owner of House Of Hartt, every inch of detailing was hand selected and chosen with love. For even more, head to the pretty gallery from The Youngrens!'
p6135
aS'From the beautiful Bride  Josh and I met on eHarmony, myself, I had only been on there for two weeks, so luckily I didn t have to go through a slew of bad dates before finding Josh. Just 6 months in we went on our first vacation in Kauai, and by then I already knew he was the one. 3 years from our very first date we found ourselves back in Kauai again for our annual summer vacation, but this time it was different. Josh had purchased a new camera that he had been filming me do almost everything on, including eating and walking, so when he decided to leave the camera rolling overnight to  catch the sunrise  I didn t question his motives. The next morning on our 3 year anniversary he woke me at 6:30 by opening the wall of curtains revealing the brightest ocean view. I immediately rolled over trying to go back to sleep. He finally was able to coax me to come to the edge of the bed, just barely awake he begins to serenade me with his ukulele (not unusual by the way). I start noticing though this time his voice is shaking, he actually seemed nervous which is not the norm. After finishing up 1,2,3,4 by Plain White Tees and a couple restarts of the song, he gets down on one knee and asks the question I had been waiting to hear almost 2 1/2 years ago! To make it even more perfect he surprised me with a serenade at our wedding! Which I was completely blown away by! He sings in front of me all the time, but never in front of an audience   an audience turns him a bit shy and bashful. But not on the day of our wedding! He was so confident and charming. He chose the song Stuck on You by Lionel Richie, which was a perfect song given I did feel like I had waited so long to become his Mrs.. It was perfect, right out of a movie.'
p6136
aS'As far as choosing our venue, we had quite the adventure! We first forfeited our deposit on the original venue we had booked. A few weeks in we had realized we had gotten ourselves into a very expensive situation and decided to cut our losses and move on. And although we did have a tight budget I didn t want to compromise the elegance and warmth of the wedding I had envisioned in my head. I knew that if we could just find the right place we could make it our own and DIY it! After looking at almost every venue in Los Angeles and Ventura county, we revisited a thought we had in the very beginning, having it at Josh s moms house   the very house he grew up in. Aesthetically it was everything I wanted anyways: lush gardens, mature trees hanging over you, organic and intimate, like you had just entered into a secret garden. The only reason we had veered away in the beginning was because it would have forced us to cut our guest list in half. But, it ended up being worth it, and I think ultimately it was meant to be. We had an intimate wedding of about 75 of all of our closest friends and family and a FREE venue! Plus the fact that Josh grew up in the house and that we of course go to his moms house all the time is a huge bonus! We get to stand in the very spot we got married in as often as we like.'
p6137
aS'The inspiration for the wedding from the very beginning was  vintage secret garden . I didn t want anything too forced, too formal, too matchy-matchy and definitely as far away from the typical ballroom or wedding hall. I wanted it to look like we just had all these things inside of our house, old family heirlooms, tapestries and mismatched crystal vases, things we had had for years, that we just sort of threw together at the very last minute to create an inviting, beautiful and mystical space. Of course, that wasn t the case at all. The reality is I went on a hunt for about 8 months through every salvation army, good will store, antique store and craigslist ad to collect almost every single piece by hand. And just to make it even more esthetically fun, we had all of our guests dress to the nines in black tie attire. It was formal and informal all at the same time. I absolutely loved creating this space so much so it inspired me to continue sharing this experience through House of Hartt Rentals & Design, a boutique vintage rental and design company.\n'

aS'From Michael & Anna Costa Photography .Libras can be described as indecisive, but when this Libra couple (born on the same day in October) saw their wedding venue on a rainy February day, they knew immediately this was the perfect spot for their late summer Santa Barbara wedding. Mike, having grown up in Santa Barbara, introduced Krista to this beautiful coastal city during weekend road trips to visit his family and friends   a short distance from Los Angeles, where the couple resides.'
p6173
aS'It was important to Krista and Mike that their love of music, artistic sense and love of family and friends be woven into their wedding day. Starting with photos for their Save the Date, Krista s younger brother snapped images of the couple around the Silver Lake neighborhood where they fell in love several years earlier. Krista worked with her parents to create the wedding invites, menu cards, and programs which all incorporated hand drawn images from her dad and copy drafted by her mom. Mike s sister baked their delicious four-tier wedding cake and Mike music directed the entire event. He selected each song for keyboard (played by a special family friend), the lower courtyard reception play list, and worked with their close friend Charlie Cole who is the lead singer of the band Famous For Nothing, for live reception music. The biggest surprise of the night for Krista was when Mike jumped on stage and played guitar with the band, which had the entire wedding rocking for the remainder of the night.'
p6174
aS'The couple had a grand exit, hugging and kissing their guests good-bye as everyone waved streamers and rang bells. Krista and Mike were peddled away on a bicycle Pedi cab into the streets of downtown Santa Barbara.\n'

S'A little glitz, a healthy dose of glamour, a bit of boho and a whole lot of love   this backyard beauty from Jillian Rose Photography is overflowing with everything we love about SMP weddings and more. Carefully curated by Tenley Erin Young, this gallery will have your pin boards exploding with pretty. '
p6266
aS'From The Bride..Being a floral and event designer, I have the luxury of finding out what a my clients  dream wedding looks like and taking it from there. But when I got engaged, the first thing I thought was, how on earth am I going to pick just one style?? There are so many incredible options, I knew I couldn t pick just one   so I thought of everything that encompassed Parker and me and mashed up each of our styles into one big explosion of color and style.'
p6267
aS'Parker asked me to marry him on a sailboat in Maine, so his anchor socks were very apropos. I love that his groomswoman decided to match the boys  oxfords. I let my bridesmaids pick something I knew they could wear again and wanted an eclectic yet complementary collection of glamorous colors, textures, and patterns. Between Adrianna Papell, Jenny Yoo, and Xscape,they definitely made it happen. Because I m a bit of a bohemian, I had to include moccasins somewhere, so we had all the kids in Minnetonkas (I actually changed into a pair later that night!).'
p6268
aS'We chose the courthouse because we met in Santa Barbara and the Mural Room is just so gorgeous. The majority of our guests were coming from out of town so we figured we d give them a mini glimpse into our lives, starting out in Santa Barbara then heading out to wine country where we had just moved. It was very important to us for everyone to feel like they were at home, which is why we decided to have the reception at our house.'
p6269
aS'Having the opportunity to work with so many amazing local vendors over the last few years, there was no question who I wanted to entrust with our wedding needs. The best advice I can give to any bride is to find someone you connect with, hire them immediately, and let them take your inspiration and run with it. I told everyone our colors, the variety of themes we were going for, and how we wanted our guests to feel and let them take it from there.'
p6270
aS'I wasn t sure where to start in terms of design. Our styles are super eclectic so I wanted to incorporate vintage, americana, bohemian, and glam and did a combo of antique furniture, leather and sequin pillows and linens, animal prints, metallic paper lanterns, tinsel, and the brightest flower combos I could think of. I wanted the reception to feel like a giant party, so I went as loud as I could go in terms if color and design.'
p6271
aS'I don t know where I would be without our photographer, Jillian. I had a feeling the day would fly by and I would miss so much and knew that she would capture it all beautifully and she did. I can t get over these photos, I feel like I m looking at a wonderful dream when I look through them. She caught every single moment and documented every single detail and I can t recommend her enough!'
p6272
aS'Omni Catering absolutely nailed it with the  elevated comfort food  we wanted. Parker and I love food and entertaining and we wanted our guests to just relax and make themselves at home. I happen to be addicted to Mac n  Cheese so they came up with a Mac n  Cheese bar (complete with bacon, gorgonzola, and crispy onions). Parker loves seafood, so we had ceviche shooters, oysters on the half shell, and ahi tartar in wonton chips. Couple all that with a trio of sliders, amazing salads, and tray passed hors d oeuvres after a gorgeous antipasto welcome station and everyone is still raving about the food. We wanted everyone to graze, so we had an all evening cocktail hour   no rules, no agenda.'
p6273
aS'I ve known Heather with Sweet Spils my entire life and was so thrilled she wanted to be a part of our day (I may have nudged her in our direction). She called to ask what we wanted and I told her I to do whatever she thought represented us. Not only were they gorgeous and one of a kind, but they were beyond delicious.'
p6274
aS'I also happen to be a big fan of champagne so what better way to celebrate than with a bubbly bar?! I ve been collecting vintage champagne coupes for the last couple years so I paired those with crystal decanters and vintage liquor inspired tags from Bad Leroy Creations to label the juices.'
p6275
aS'I tend to go overboard on most things in life, so the DIY list is too long. So unless you have a staff of 20 at your beck and call, just hire someone to do it (seriously!). Parker s last name is Hardt, so I had to incorporate that. I found a super cool geometric heart online and used that as our logo throughout the wedding. I sewed the leather pillows, painted and hung the paper lanterns, made tassels and fringe, cut out the big wooden heart and covered it with glitter, painted the mason jars in a variety of metallic paints, and collaborated with Meg at Sweet Carolina Collective on all the wooden menus and signage.'
p6276
aS'The passion from every single person involved in our wedding is still beyond my comprehension. Up until the day of I kept thinking we should ve just eloped. But as soon as I walked into our backyard and saw every single person we love and the whole vision come to life I knew that it was all worth it. I really wish we could do it all again. '

It s got a whole lot of heart and a coming together of culture and family that only Em The Gem could capture so beautifully. See this full affair in all its pastel glory right here.'
p6334
aS'From Em The Gem Nicole and Myron   and their romantic wine country wedding day   are a beautiful example of how fluidly cultures blend in the San Francisco Bay Area. Nicole s family comes from Mexico. Myron s family comes from Sri Lanka. They met in San Diego and, fast forward eleven years, tied the knot in Sonoma Valley. His family is Hindu; her family is Catholic; and the reverend who married them is Presbyterian.'
p6335
aS'Weaving aspects of their cultures, values, and families into the wedding day was important to Nicole and Myron. From subtle touches like Sri Lankan treats as part of the dessert bar, to central moments like performing the Mexican Lasso ritual as part of the ceremony, they personalized every aspect of the day. They also wanted to honor those who could not attend in special ways, such as with the  Pepsi and Peanuts  station that Nicole put together in honor of her grandfather, who always gave the children of the family these items on their birthdays.'
p6336
aS'It was so wonderful to be a part of this day   all the families came together and had an amazing beautiful day in Sonoma. The weather was perfect, everyone enjoyed multiple trips to the dessert buffet and danced the night away.\n'

S'Can you even imagine the pressure two wedding photographers must feel when it s time to pick the perfect person to capture their big day? Talk about a hard planning desicion. But these two talents (he s the genius behind Patterson Films and she of Majesta Patterson) knew exactly what they were doing when they asked Evynn LeValley to capture the magic of their big day. Their DIY wedding is one you ll want to spend some serious quality time with, and you can do so here.'

aS'From chalkboard signs made from thrifted picture frames & window panes to making our apricot jam from my parents backyard; we made it all! We made the wood ceremony arbor out of trees from my parents yard and $30 worth of supplies; we thrifted an old wooden ladder to paint fun signs with directions (since the estate was large and we held different events across the property); and made all painted signs from old wood and palettes on my parents property. Yes, I wrote all the signs with a paint brush.'
p6382
aS'I made our guestbook from an antique photo album featuring all of our engagement pictures; as well as, our cake topper, table numbers and we bottled and labeled our own wine from a local winery. It really was a labor of love.'
p6383
aS'My advice to future brides: make a list and ask for help. Know what s a priority and if you can t handle it all, delegate! Aside from our ceremony arch and jam favors, our other BIG task was to create our table runners. I simply didn t have time and while it was cheaper to make it in supplies, it was worth the money to pay a rental company and relive me of my stress! We ended up loving our tables with the pink runners versus my original plans.'
p6384
aS'Lastly, put your time into the decor and hire someone to bring your vision to life. While we built, painted, ordered, boxed and prepped everything, I could not have executed my vision without my wedding coordinators. They really brought my vision to life and I m so thankful!'
p6385
aS'Our wedding came to life beautifully. Our guests loved our signature drinks, bluegrass band, amazing DJ and our perfect ceremony. It was also really important to us that we included our guests in our ceremony and we wanted them to feel special. After all, they are our most loved! We asked a close friend to marry us, made sure we took a minute to look around when we finally stood at our ceremony arch, wrote our own vows and LAUGHED, cried and just had an amazing time. Even forgetting my vows back in the bridal suite (my brother ran and got them for me), our ceremony was nothing short of perfect and it s one of my favorite memories from our wedding.'

S'Sometimes a theme isn t shouted, but instead is more of a whisper. This carnival themed affair crafted by Shannon Leahy Events and Cherries Flowers is understated, letting the vibrant color palette of pink and aqua hues and small touches really set the stage. But maybe the best detail of all? That would be the edible cotton candy escort cards. Genius, and so beautifully photographed by Ryan Ray. See it here.'

aS'From Shannon Leahy Events For Kassandra & Michael, St. Vincent s in San Rafael was the perfect location for their fun-filled carnival-themed wedding. Filled with vibrant colors and classic carnival elements, this beautiful wedding was an affair to remember for all of their guests.'
p6446
aS'The papers for the wedding included whimsical and light details based off of the architecture of the space. Kassandra and Miles s light-hearted personalities were revealed in individual cotton candy escort cards and carnival games for their guests to enjoy during cocktail hour.  Arriving in a vintage bride car, Kassandra looked stunning in a beautiful empire gown with floral details, while Michael looked handsome and collected in hues of blue.\n'

S'Without fail, a good ol  family gathering tugs at my heart strings like no other. And when it comes in the form of this intimate celebration captured by Mirelle Carmichael, the imagery becomes wedding-candy for the soul. Complete with a handmade dress passed down from the Bride s mother, darling DIY details for days and so much love to go around, I m betting this gallery will warm your heart right up!'
p6481
aS'From The Bride s Mother  It all began when the bride, Annika Johnson (now Michetti), tried on her mother s handmade wedding dress when she was 10 years old. As she swirled, twirled and laughed, she said,  I want to wear this on my wedding day! '
p6482
aS'It was truly a family affair, with handmade decorations, home-cooking, and kind friends wanting to help. The wedding had the vibe of a lovely summer party and village f te! Fairy lights and strings of candy colored tissue-paper flowers created a canopy over the  family style  tables. The tables were studded with gorgeous standout features made by the family: napkins, jars of strawberry jam favors, sparkly letters of  Mr. & Mrs. , miles of bunting, tea lights, gold polka-dot mason jars and assorted arrangements of country flowers.'
p6483
aS'For the ceremony pristine white tissue-paper flowers were attached to the front of the cottage and guests threw confetti from hand-sewn wax paper packets made by the bride s sister, Miranda Reader. The presider and musicians were all friends and circled the couple with words and songs of love.'
p6484
aS'Vintage lace and linens, borrowed dainty china plates and country mice (that once graced the wedding cake of the bride s parents) were all used to adorn the pie table. The pie table was stacked with assorted pies that were baked by the mother of the bride and her good friend during the peak of summer to ensure the best flavor for this special day. The happy couple used a machete (a pun on the common mispronunciation of their last name) to cut into the first pie.'
p6485
aS'The bride, Annika, was ethereal in her  restyled  mother s wedding dress; floating in soft raw silk and chiffon. At the rehearsal dinner, she had also worn her grandmother s wedding dress to the event. She created all the lovely hair pieces for the women in the bridal party, as well as sewing the final touches to her crystal beaded sash on her wedding day!'
p6486
aS'The groom created the wedding invitations/responses with the whimsical charm of flora and fauna inspired from the venue site. It was serendipitous to be able to have Mirelle Carmichael photograph the wedding as she had previously photographed the bride s sister s wedding as well! Her artistic instincts were much appreciated and her calming smile were soothing for the wedding party.'
p6487
aS'From the beautiful Bride I was so incredibly blessed to have my mother and sister take on so many projects for the wedding. With only a five month engagement it was a huge relief to be able to tell my mother what my husband and I had in mind for the wedding and having her organize it and create a wedding more magical than we could have imagined. Wearing my mother s wedding dress (after having a few alternations done) was very special, especially since my parent s 32 year marriage has been an inspiration to me. Favorite moments for the groom and I during the wedding were giggling with the groom during wedding pictures with Mirelle before the wedding, the groom s prayer during communion together and, seeing each other  all dressed up and fancy, cutting the pie with the machete, the fun interactive toast by the maid of honor and dancing down the aisle during the recessional as guests threw confetti and the musicians sang  Hey Ho  by the Lumineers. The groom and I both thought we were blessed to be in love and have our families all around us!\n'
