S'Fresh wedding ideas get my heart racing and the thought of a champagne brunch reception, with a little Southern charm tossed in, and I m sold. Held at the gorgeous Armour House outside of Chicago, this summertime fete has me absolutely swooning   and taking notes. Two Birds Photography worked their magic and I m adding pocketed gowns, orchids and historic mansions to my list of favorites immediately.'

aS'From Gail at GZ Weddings & Special Events  Lauren and Brian were married on Saturday, August 9, 2014 at the historic Armour House on the grounds of Lake Forest Academy in Chicago s northwest suburbs.'
p37
aS'Their ceremony was held outdoors on a beautiful, sunny morning. Lauren s dream was to have a wedding and reception on a estate that was similar to the look of a southern plantation. Their event included many traditions that described good ole  southern charm since Lauren s family is originally from New Orleans.'
p38
aS'Their reception immediately followed and included those southern details such as shrimp & grits, and chicken & biscuit benedicts on their brunch buffet! Their  Champagne Brunch Reception  was accompanied by music from the Elmhurst College Jazz Band who played popular tunes from the roaring 20 s and classics that everyone enjoyed.'
p39
aS'Lauren s wedding gown was something right off of a southern plantation! She wanted it to look simple yet elegant for their morning wedding.'

aS'The plants and centerpieces that helped achieve the look of an outdoor garden reception were brought in and created by the mother of the bride.\n'

S'Back in college, I sort of prided myself on being an art history buff. And when one summer program took me to the city of Florence, studying the greats like Botticelli, you better believe that love of Italian Renaissance stuck with me. *Enter* this Primavera-inspired shoot put together by the fabulous Kate Weinstein Photo, A Splendid Occasion and Layers Of Loveliness. They teamed up for their own dreamy bridal interpretation, and if you ask me? Well, they hit the nail on the head.'
p73
aS'From Kate Weinstein Photo The Villa Terrace is a beautiful Italian-style venue and art museum located in the heart of Milwaukee. For this shoot, we wanted to design something that fit the classical style of the venue but we also wanted to keep it simple; the Villa Terrace is already beautifully designed as it is so it doesn t require much additional decoration. Our color and mood inspiration for the shoot was Botticelli s moody and ethereal painting  Primavera. '

S'Clary Pfeiffer works magic behind a lens, this we know. So when she is capturing a wedding as naturally gorgeous as this St. Louis beauty at the Missouri History Museum we get sit back and reap all of the lovely rewards. Romantic and filled with soft fall hues, every image sitting in this gallery is a beautiful work of art. See them all here.'
p107
aS'From The Bride When Tom and I started looking for a venue all we knew is that we wanted something a little different. After visiting quite a few places, we found ourselves walking through the doors at Missouri History Museum. When we left, Tom and I both looked at each other and without saying anything, knew that it was where we would say our  I do s . The building holds a lot of history, both literally and figuratively. Constructed in 1927, the Byzantine-style structure was used as home to the United Hebrew Congregation until it was bought by the Missouri Historical Society in 1989. It s a true mix of classic and contemporary architecture which greatly appealed to our quirky tastes. After the venue, the first person I contacted was Clary Pfeiffer of Clary Photo. I knew that, after the wedding, all I would have left to take with me were the photography and our memories. I was absolutely thrilled to learn that she was available. I knew that with Clary behind the camera, our wedding was going to look stunning.'
p108
aS'The striking Museum was the perfect backdrop to our event, which we filled with timeless and personal details to match. Overgrown flowers spilled over pieces of silver from antique store finds and my colleague s private collection, brightening up the entire space. A quartet filled the atrium with both classic and contemporary tunes. Trays filled with colorful d oeuvres and cocktails. Still, we managed to fit in many personal touches to the day   from the invitations I designed to the calligraphy that I practiced for weeks to perfect and even the bridesmaid dresses from the girl s own closets, matching the desire for our individuality to shine through. Every part of the day went seamlessly. It truly was a dream and I can t wait to see what the rest of our lives has in store for us!'
p109
aS'Tom and I had known each other for a long time before we began dating. We grew up in the same neighborhood but did not meet until we were introduced by a mutual friend. We were only 12 at the time and were interested in many things, but not each other. Tom and I began  officially  dating the winter of our senior year of High School. We were young, in love, and inseparable. The Fall of the following year I left for The Kansas City Art Institute and Tom went north to Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. Distance got the better of us and we decided to put our relationship on pause although we remained friends. I m not sure if I believe in fate, but there was a reason that we both ended up back in our home town of St. Louis, Missouri after college. Four years later, I married the man of my dreams. The rest  is history!\n'

S'This Mark Zunino Bride and her handsome groom were literally surrounded with love on their wedding day. Evan Hunt captured the moments that mattered, while close family and friends gathered at Balena for an inviting celebration planned by Kelly Cavanaugh. From the six cakes baked out of love, to Artistrings rendition of Katy Perry, every detail was personal and you can see it all here.'
p174
aS'From The Bride On a whim, I signed up for a beginners  rock climbing class, thinking I should try something new and different. I noticed a good-looking guy in the advanced class. He introduced himself and we chatted briefly during class for a few weeks. Eventually he invited me to come climb with him on a Friday night. When I arrived, he encouraged me to try a move that was clearly above my skill-levl, offering to take me out for a drink if I could make it. I didn t make it and instead fell off the wall injuring my knee, but I still got that drink. We had a blast that night and have been together ever since. We are total partners in life and we love to do things our own way. We added running, mountain biking, and wake surfing and you can always find us taking adventures together, including moving to the suburbs.'
p175
aS'Our wedding really reflected our personal choices and who we are as a couple. From the beginning, it was important to us to have a beautiful wedding without all of the fuss. Our favorite parts of other weddings are the ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing. So, we decided to mash them all together and skip (almost) everything else   including a formal dinner with seat assignments   in favor of a more relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. We knew immediately that we wanted to have the wedding at Balena; the food is divine, the drinks are spectacular, the staff is amazing, and the decor reflects perfectly the things we like and the mood of the day: warm and inviting, with soft beautiful lighting, rich leather chairs, and exposed wood.'
p176
aS'Our ceremony was  in the round,  with my law-school best friend officiating and our moms providing heartfelt personal introductions. Our family and bridal party sat in chairs around the ceremony and everyone else stood around, which lent to the intimate, family atmosphere. The introduction to my favorite Coldplay song  Reign of Love , played as I walked down the aisle and a quartet played a version of Katy Perry s  Teenage Dream  for the recessional.'
p177
aS'After the ceremony, I changed out of my first dress and heels and into a comfortable ball-gown and flats. Dave kept me company as I had my hair twirled into a bun, and we snacked on appetizers and champagne in the quiet of Balena s downstairs private-dining room. The reception was divine; we hand picked our favorite items off Balena s seasonal menu, and Dave s sister made six gorgeous cakes. We named our signature drinks  The Polly  and  The Reuben,  after the characters in  Along Came Polly  who remind us of each other. Our family and friends were in on all aspects of the wedding, my mom designed our invitations and made the groomsmen s cufflinks. A family friend handled all the flowers. Almost all our vendors were friends, and all were in attendance to help us celebrate. We were surrounded by love at our wedding and wouldn t have done it any other way.\n'

S'When the Bride s family owns and operates Mustard Seed Gardens you know that her wedding day will be filled with all sorts of magic, especially with Bobbi+mike behind the lens and Rewind Documentaries behind the camera. Lori Solomon   Boldly Chic Events spared no darling detail, like those perfectly pink blooms by Design Group and that sweetheart cake by The Topping that deserve a second look here.'
p232
aS'From The Bride My family has owned Mustard Seed Gardens for the past 9 years, so our choice in venue was never a question. Originally a property for us to accommodate another business, MSG has, in most recent years, molded into one of the premier wedding venues in Indianapolis. Working hand and hand with virtually every bride we accompany, needless to say, not only have I see many weddings, but I ve also seen a plethora of ideas. Choosing the ceremony and reception site was easy, picking a style, theme, and an inspiration that I hadn t seen before now that was the tricky part!'
p233
aS'Due to a large number of guests which would simply make our Olde Barn too crowded for a reception, we knew right away we would be having a barn ceremony, with an outdoor reception, (originally slated to be under our canopy of lights, finally settling on a tent due to weather, which I will touch on shortly). Inside the Olde Barn, beautifully crafted from the 19th century, you can see exposed beams from the original structure which hold everything in place. There had been ceremonies in the barn before, so we again faced the challenge of finding something authentic. In came the idea of our  big reveal  room. A small enclosure, only 4 5 feet, at the rear of the barn, which I sat prior to the ceremony. Blending in to the existing framework, I don t think any guest realized, that the woman of the hour had literally been sitting in there, awaiting the special moment while they filtered past, hurrying to their respective seats. The room was flanked on each side of the doorway by two, 4 foot tall vases which houses a massive display of flowers. Maybe the only indication of my presence behind those doors. The  reveal room  for lack of a better term, was my father s idea. A symbolic idea for which he would walk down the aisle during the ceremony and open the doors to a waiting daughter. The moment couldn t have been more perfect. Aside from the  reveal room  we wanted our primary focus to be at the altar. An old ladder hung above our heads as we stood facing each other. Draped with flowers, greenery, and various candles, created a beautiful scene at the altar. The hanging ladder was nothing new to our property, but the way in which our florist designed it, left no detail and amount of elegance to be desired. Behind us and our pastor sat a vintage table topped with a gorgeous centerpiece of flowers, as well as a gold platter which held a single glass of wine and a small loaf of bread. My husband and I decided that we wanted communion to be the first official moment we spent together.'
p234
aS'After the ceremony we made our way to the back part of MSG to take photos. While we took pictures, our guests were able to socialize and enjoy refreshments and hor d oevres on our newly designed patio area. My family designed the stamped concrete foundation for cocktail hour just weeks before our big day. We placed various vintage wine barrels around this area which were used for the purpose of tables. Topped with a solid glass oval and each housing a beautifully crafted centerpiece.'
p235
aS'The flow from the ceremony to our reception was an easy one for our guest. With everything being right there on the grounds, our guests didn t have to go far to find their way to dinner. Our table arrangements were beautifully etched in cursive font on a vintage mirror. As I mentioned before, our original idea was to have an open air reception outdoors, under a canopy of lights which would be strung high in a tree and spider webbing down, crisscrossing above our guest s heads. As one can imagine, weather was our only concern. Although our wedding day couldn t have had better weather, the same cannot be said of the the days prior. Due to the rain earlier in the week we were forced to construct a tent in order to keep the grounds dry. It wasn t what we originally wanted, but we both can say without a doubt that we wouldn t have wanted it any other way.'
p236
aS'Inside of our tent couldn t have been more beautiful. Our centerpieces featured various gold vases and gold candelabra s atop with garden like flowers. During our planning process, we searched the city for vintage pink depression glasses. We found various size vases to use for centerpieces but we also found pink wine glasses which we intermixed with crystal wine glasses to give our tables an eclectic look. We had our menus custom designed which we placed on top of each gold rimmed plate. We tied a pink ribbon around each menu and placed a sprig of willow eucalyptus to add texture and greenery. Our table numbers were made out of acrylic which were tucked nicely into the floral arrangements. We also incorporated framed table numbers to again add to the eclectic look. Each table was very romantic!'
p237
aS'We didn t go your traditional route where the entire wedding party sits together. Many of our groups had spouses and children, we felt it more of a convenience to sit near or with their family. So a small sweetheart table was the primary focus and the place in which we sat. Atop our table sat our sweetheart cake and a massive display of flowers that began in a large cluster on top and cascaded off the edge down to the ground. Mixed with flowers matching the colors of our wedding, the centerpiece was astonishing. We also sat in two large wing-backed chairs which made for a unique and cozy seat option.'
p238
aS'Dinner was served and our meal was presented first. First came a refreshing spinach, strawberry and candied walnut salad with a strawberry champagne vinaigrette followed by the main course, a duo of Filet Mignon and chicken with a smoked Gouda and potato side along with some asparagus. After dinner our guests were able to enjoy various desserts. We chose small pie shooters which were gooey, crumbly creations housed in a shot glass and accompanied by a very small spoon. Miniature cupcakes and small macaroons also were incorporated, each consisting of our favorite flavors and colors of our wedding, blush and gold. Next to our dessert station was a self-serve coffee bar. A large metal  tree , (for a lack of better terms) held each mug for guests to better serve themselves. Guest could choose between regular and decaf coffee, as well as choose between varieties of flavored creamers which we placed in vintage milk bottles.'
p239
aS'Music and dancing, laughter and singing all could be seen and heard for the remaining few hours of the reception. One particular detail that we decided was an absolute must was the presence of a late night snack for our remaining party goers. A hard menu decision for us, we finally settled on miniature cheeseburger sliders with a self-serve condiment station.'
p240
aS'Time was drawing to a close, but not before a little surprise for my husband. I arranged for a small sitting area to be set up, just outside the tent and snack station, under the canopy of light which hung from the trees. The sitting area would be a spot where the remaining guests could each enjoy a cigar. As we looked back at the evening, we both agreed that, even though the night was inevitably drawing to a close, the time sitting at the cigar bar was one of the more special moments of the entire evening. We were finally able to relax, and enjoy a special moment with a small group of close friends and family that had remained till the end.'
p241
aS'Sadly, our send off. A bitter sweet moment it was. Happy to be beginning the journey of our lives together, but sad to end the celebration. Having coordinated several weddings on our property, I had been accustom to a number of send-off techniques. But we wanted something we hadn t seen before. After many hours scouring the web, I found candle lit balloons. The balloons housed a small LED light which made the sphere glow a softly that was truly remarkable at night.\n'

S'On the (very long) list of things I love, outdoor garden weddings are pretty close to the tippy top. And it really only takes one look at these stunning images from Heather Roth Fine Art Photography to know why they rank so high. Elegant yet comfy with a swoon-worthy color palette and drop dead gorgeous details planned by Kate & Company, this wedding is simply as good as they get.'
p327
aS'From The Bride, Julie Gregory and I met in the summer of 2011, and we both knew pretty quickly that we would be spending our forevers together. We shared so much love and laughter from day one that it never made sense for it to be another way. Gregory loves surprises, however, and I had no idea when, where, or how he would pop the question. On December 15, 2012, he proposed to me at the finish line of the last race of the season, and he had arranged for our families to be there to celebrate. I was on cloud nine the entire day.'
p328
aS'From a young age, I had always dreamed of getting married outside; there is something magical about nature that I have yet to find in any indoor space. Fortunately, Gregory was on board from day one, and we quickly chose the Missouri Botanical Garden for our venue. Thanks to an amazing dream-team of vendors, we began to see our dream wedding come together over the next year and a half.'
p329
aS'In the afternoon of May 25, 2014, we had our first look near the fountain at the Ritz Carlton in Clayton. I had had butterflies the entire morning just waiting to share this moment with my future husband. And indeed, with no one around other than the person I loved the most, it was one of the most magical moments on earth.'
p330
aS'We were married under a beautiful birch chuppa against the backdrop of the Japanese Garden lagoon. It was such an amazing feeling to be marrying my best friend in the most breathtaking venue with all of our family and friends around us. We then had cocktail hour on the plaza followed by our reception in the visitor s center (Monsanto Hall), a once blank slate that had become home to an upscale garden party. The room was everything we had hoped for   candlelit tables, lush florals, fantastic music, and delicious food. I had never smiled as much as I did that day in my entire life. From the poignant speeches to the party on the dance floor and the late-night grilled cheese food truck, we couldn t have asked for a better celebration of our love.'
p331
aS'From Kate & Company Julie + Greg had one of my favorite designs for the year! When we first met Julie + Greg we instantly knew their wedding would be fun! The biggest challenge would be incorporating the sparkle and the modern influences that Julie gravitated to with the rustic, garden feel her chosen venue had.'
p332
aS'We began our design with the nude palette that is so popular this year! To give Julie + Greg s wedding a different twist we put the bridesmaids in three different colors and used that as our main color scheme. We pulled in sequin linens for a modern pop of sparkle but countered it with a rattan charger to balance the garden influences. We used a linen napkin that was perfect for summer and placed a stem of seeded eucalyptus on each place setting! It was the perfect combination of rustic and glam   just like Julie + Greg!'
p333
aS'The birch huppah with the soft, romantic flowers were the perfect scene setter for this outdoor ceremony. And what outdoor ceremony would be complete without programs printed on the fans? One additional design element used throughout was shades of nude and blush ribbons. We began by incorporating themon the invitation, then tying the program with a bow, using ribbon wands as our escort cards, tying each set of silverware with a ribbon, and finally with a gorgeous 30  ribbon wall.'
p334
aS'We worked with a local decor company to create a custom ribbon wall backdrop to anchor the head table with. We added whimsical details such as custom drink stirrers to ensure this wedding was just as much fun as it was formal! Finally we collaborated with a florist to ensure that the flowers were the perfect mix of textures and colors to balance our sparkle rustic theme! Using a mixture of textures, colors in the florals as well as in the containers, mixing various heights in the arrangements, and using three separate types of centerpieces gave the room the wow factor it deserved!\n'

S'I love Olivia Leigh. Seriously. She captures weddings in a way that tells the prettiest of stories, and I always want to reach through the screen and kiss her for it. This chic Chicago soiree is a wonderful example, because boy does it have a story to tell. With literary nods tucked throughout the floral-filled reception, it s all as gorgeous as it is meaningful, and you can see just what I mean here.'
p380
aS'Detail wise, this one was a stunner, with an enormous and lush bouquet which we often don t get in the city. The maids wore a dress of their choosing in pink, gold or blue. Table decor paid more nods to the literary bent with many different quotes about love from a variety of authors printed on one side of the menu cards along with, of course, the menu on the other side. It was so fun to walk around and read all the different quotes and it really lent a super personalized feel to the day! Card tables were done as library call number cards with ivy and greenery spilling out of card catalogs. Tables featured rustic summer blooms along with golden pears and candle light. Angelo is Italian and many of the guests were from Italy. Limoncello paid homage to his heritage with his dad giving a beautiful toast, and the backs of the bride and groom chairs reading Avere & Tenere (to have and to hold). All of this of course was beautifully accented by the amazing architectural gem that is the Cultural Center! Emily and Angelo did my favorite first dance EVER to Be My Baby by the Ronettes which was just so special in this space. Lastly, the invitations were AMAZING with vintage postcards of Chicago reproduced as Save the Dates and beautiful custom calligraphy by Jilly Ink & Sarah Drake Design pulling in their beautiful color scheme. It was just gorgeous!\n'

S'With the perfect amount of charm and glam, this DIY wedding crafted up by the stunning Bride below is one for the books. Why you ask? Well, because not only did she dream up all the swoon-worthy details sitting in this gallery captured by Jenny Haas Photograph, but those amazing take-your-breath-away florals? She whipped those up too. I know, it s too much   but there is even more waiting for you here.'
p457
aS'Some of my favorite details of the day were the florals, Heather designed them herself [crazy and ambitious!] she did an amazing job! I loved the pops of color and they accented the bridesmaids dresses perfectly. I also thought it was unique that some of the girls wore black gowns and some of them work mismatched pastel gowns. Heather s gown was simple and elegant.'
p458
aS'The tables at the reception were covered with gold table clothes and decorated with blacks and golds. Heather and Loftur made CDS for favors with their favorite songs, and Heather arranged all of the flowers. The Art Institute was the perfect backdrop for all of the details!\n'

Farm Friends NFP proved to be the perfect place and with Tonya Tuitman behind the scenes every moment sparkled (just like the Bride s bouquet!). After taking a peek at all the pretty snapped up by the talented Peter Gubernat, this cream of the crop gallery has me feeling right at home.'
p486
aS'From Peter Gubernat Chantel and Chris are a pretty awesome couple. Aside from the strong love they have for each other, they have an awesome story to tell.'
p487
aS'When Chantel was younger, she was in a pretty bad car accident. Through a number of operations she had a number of metal plates grafted to her bones. Through intensive therapy and rehab the plates were removed and she saved them in a jar for 16 years.'
p488
aS'Now, enter Chris. Knowing Chantel had these metal plates, what better way to express his love for her than making his wedding ring from those same metal plates? That s exactly what he did.'

Cristina G caught every smile and this gallery leaves me feeling very jealous of all those lucky guests.'
p534
aS'From The Bride  We met in the theater in 2007. We were cast in one of the best and most romantic musicals of all time,  West Side Story.  Daniel played  Baby John  and I was a dancer and  girlfriend of Diesel  in the  Jet  gang. We became great friends through long rehearsals and the run of the show. We started dating and realized very quickly we were good for each other s soul. We dated for seven years which took us from our hometown Milwaukee, WI to Chicago, IL. Along the way we  grew up  together, became best friends, held each other s hand through really hard times, and supported each other through our greatest successes. Being struggling artists is not easy, but Daniel is the person you want at the finish line when you have nothing left and I m the person encouraging you along the way. '
p535
aS'It was in year six when the proposal happened. We had finally found our place in Chicago. I was coming home on a rainy evening from work and messaged Dan to see if he d pick me up from the train to avoid the wet walk home. He replied  I m at work babe.  I walked home and noticed on the front door to our building, was taped a white envelope that said  Holly.  Inside read a list of reasons why Dan loved me. I walked up the three flights of stairs to another envelope   more reasons. I paused, knowing what was going on, and took a deep breath. Inside I found more letters, flowers, and pictures of our 6 year journey scattered everywhere amongst candles! I walked through our apartment and found more letters leading me to our back porch. I opened the door and found Dan, in a fancy suit surrounded by twinkle lights with our song playing. He got down on one knee and opened the box. In true fashion, I swore like a sailor, and said YES! The ring was custom made by Dan and is spectacular!\n'

S'The most memorable weddings, in my opinion, are fabulous and fun and this upbeat farm affair is both. Coordinated by Canvas Weddings and filled with blooms by Alluring Blooms the couples  special touches made the day extra lovely   like favors of local honey and the mini escort card canoes   and with a fabulous photographer like Paige Green  on the guest list we can relive every gleeful moment here.'
p601
aS'From planner Corinne Van Arsdale of Canvas Weddings There is a word in the Yiddish language that comes to mind whenever I think of Keri and Ricker and their wedding day: bashert. Bashert means  destiny,  or meant to be, and is commonly used in reference to one s soulmate. Not only are Keri and Ricker the utter definition of  meant to be,  (they both referred to each other as  my totes bestie  in their vows), but I sort of feel like my role in their wedding was fated. '
p602
aS'I met Keri when I was still living in Chicago. I was working at BHLDN-Chicago, and a recently-engaged Keri and her now-mother-in-law were in town for the weekend for a wedding, and decided to drop in to the store to try on some wedding dresses, and I was assigned to handle their walk-in appointment. Needless to say, we got along swimmingly, and after some chatting, I discovered they were from Madison   where I was going to be moving in a few short months. Long story short, Keri and Ricker were the first Madison couple to hire me for their wedding, and my love story with Madison weddings began to unfold.'
p603
aS'Keri & Ricker are just special, and I m so grateful that they ve become near and dear friends, because I know for certain I would have missed their joy, quirky silliness and their spirit had we stopped spending time together post-wedding. Every inch of this day was sweet, open and pure joy   just like them. The weekend kicked off with a  Welcome to Madison  party at the Madison Children s Museum that included a Friday Fish Fry, beer on the roof and a performance by an improve troupe. The  farm-fresh  wedding day was held on the groom s family farm and included a sweet ceremony on the lawn, a sparkling water bar, plenty of hand-made details, delicious cuisine, an epic rain storm and dancing all night to live music.'
p604
aS'From The Couple Aside from throwing a celebration that sincerely reflected our joyful life together, we wanted the events to convey a sense of place. We d both lived in some amazing locations independently of one another   San Francisco, Denver, Bolivia, Chicago, Central Pennsylvania   and we met in Lake Tahoe where neither of us resided. So, it made sense to us to really highlight Madison as the place where we settled down to begin our life together.'
p605
aS'The playful vibe of the museum captured our aesthetic perfectly for the welcome party & rehearsal dinner. We decorated the tables with  still life  collected at local thrift stores. Everything from kitschy Wisconsin souvenirs to Viewmaster reels of UW-Madison of to Packer helmets doubled as centerpieces and floral containers.'
p606
aS'We knew we wanted to hold the ceremony and reception on the family farm where Ricker s parents were married. The property has been in the family since the early 1950s, having passed from his grandparents to his parents. The farm provided the ideal setting for a wedding redolent of pastoral life. The wooden tables dressed in lace and burlap, the horses, the flowers in vintage vegetable cans and delicious, simple arrangements and the Swedish folk-art stage backdrop were just some of the elements we used to call attention to the Norwegian and German farmhouse roots of the area.'
p607
aS'If we could make it personal, we did. Rings, earrings, dresses, ties, veils, suits and paper goods were all custom designed for us. Perhaps most importantly, we built the ceremony from the ground up. First we sat down to discuss what was important to us in our future as a married couple. Adventure, laughter, friendship, love, gratitude and family stood out and these principles became readings (and a song) that anchored our ceremony. We enlisted Ricker s brother-in-law s father to officiate. He had performed these duties for his own daughter s wedding and melted our hearts. He was an obvious choice. Our vows were personally written and from the heart, and we sealed the deal with a kiss that ignited actual fireworks detonated by two groomsmen. Delighted yet surprised, my grandmother nearly fell off of her chair!'
p608
aS'Ricker and I are each other s best friends. We certainly take our commitment seriously but never forget to have fun together. Whether we re singing made-up songs in the kitchen to our lab pup Monty, or hiking in Costa Rica, there s no other person we would rather be with. And we hope that everyone left our wedding weekend feeling as happy, lively and in love as we did.'

S'Clary Pfeiffer has a beautiful way with the camera. So when she steps behind the lens to capture a wedding as chic and classic as this beauty, I know we are in for a treat. And let me just tell you, this gallery is certainly a treat. Modern and sophisticated, this couples  beautiful day plays out like a dream, leaving us with a stunning collection of images that each look like a work of art. See them all here.'

aS'From The Bride Keith always says it was love at first sight, but it took me a little longer. We met our first year in college at DePauw University; Greencastle, Indiana. Three years later, we started dating. Since then, we ve been together through six moves, five jobs, four apartments, and now, one wedding. Long distance isn t for everyone, but it made us strong communicators, and an even stronger couple. Now that we re in the same place and life has settled down, we couldn t be happier.'

aS'When you have the perfect Chicago spring day, everything seems to go right. And that s exactly what happened on May 31, 2014. It was a warm 72 degrees with a lake breeze, and after nearly eight years together, we were getting married. From the ceremony to the reception, the day moved beautifully. The feel of our Museum of Contemporary Art party was fresh and modern, with clean lines and all white tables. We aimed for timeless elegance, yet kept the celebration chic and current. Nothing says spring like white tulips, peonies, and ranunculus (bride s favorite flower), which were spread throughout the main gallery floor. To make the grand gallery space feel more intimate, yet still dramatic, we opted for two long king s tables to seat our 175 guests. Perhaps our favorite memory of the day was dancing our first dance, as the Bubbly Creek Band played. Our love for Bluegrass music is something we enjoy as a couple, and their performance was fresh and fun a great way to transition into the party! We couldn t have asked for more love and energy from our guests!\n'

S'Love is limitless as this couple discovered when they canceled their original plans and opted for a woodland ceremony surrounded by close family and furry friends. The sprinkling sky didn t stop The Days Design from curating an exceptionally romantic day filled with vintage tea cups and bright blooms, and Kelly Sweet s camera caught every last bit. See it all right here!'
p692
aS'From The Bride & Groom When planning our dream wedding, we hit a few bumps. We lost our first venue due to poor management. With less than a year left we booked another venue, but the style was completely different. We basically had to start planning from scratch. Six months before the wedding I got laid off from my job. That s when we decided to plan something more intimate and budget friendly.'
p693
aS'We ditched the venue (and our $1,200 deposit) in favor of Nature. We got married in the Sanctuary Woods Nature Preserve near Lake Macatawa in Holland, MI. Instead of having the 200 guests we originally planned on, we invited only our parents, wedding party, and furry friends.'
p694
aS'Because of the intimate style, we were able to have the most amazing  Alice In Wonderland  inspired Tea Party. Shelby from The Days Design came out to set up the beautiful table and flowers in the pouring rain. She did an amazing job, despite the circumstances. We are so thankful for all of her help.'
p695
aS'Our amazing cake came from Second Floor Bakery in Holland, MI. We decided to go big for drama, and the humidity and rain melted the fondant in the most spectacular way. So Mad Tea Party!'
p696
aS'From the beginning I knew that the photography was the most important part (besides marrying the man of my dreams, of course) to me. I could not have asked for a more amazing, talented and patient photographer. Not only did Kelly Sweet follow us through the woods in the rain, while carrying her equipment; she also made the most out of the unexpected weather, and gave us creative, magazine worthy photos that we will pass on to our grandchildren.'
p697
aS'Prior to the ceremony we laid out a circle of rocks for us to stand in. We placed the Rose Quartz, (a gift from Holly at Mother Moon in Saugatuck), at the top of the circle. The procession began and we walked in towards the circle and LaRissa invited us into the circle to start our ceremony. A lovely poem was read by LaRissa that described the union and symbolism of being out in the woods surrounded by nature. We exchanged our vows and placed our rings and declared our love.'
p698
aS'After our vows we drank from a chalice (from Sweetwater Pottery in Montana) to bless our union. We invited our loved ones into our circle to drink from the cup as we were all united as a whole. As we walked out of the ceremony circle, now united as husband and wife, our guests threw seeded confetti that will bloom into wildflowers. After the ceremony we moved to the table where we sat as a family and made rounds of toasts and had cake together before the night ended.'
p699
aS'My best advice to couples planning their big day is this; Spending tons of money doesn t make your day perfect and you can t control the weather, what makes your day perfect is the love that you re celebrating and nothing can change that.\n'

S'This wedding, by far, is one of the most beautiful celebrations I have ever laid my eyes upon. Uniquely mixing cultures and traditions, it also looks like one heck of a good time. Cherry Blossom Events orchestrated it perfectly, with Geneoh Photography and Casey Huxtable ensuring no moment will ever be forgotten. TGIF because I can t stop going through this enchanting gallery over and over again.'
p793
aS'From The Bride  Planning a wedding is no easy feat, even on the smallest of scales. In my opinion, planning a fusion wedding is in a world of its own! From the moment we got engaged, Kabeer and I knew that we wanted to plan a wedding that would be representative of our family moving forward. We wanted to celebrate the marriage of two cultures full of their own traditions and two families with different approaches to weddings. Most of the elements of our wedding had the  fusion  touch, including the ceremonies, the food, the decorations and the attire. We wanted to highlight the essence and beauty of both cultures without competition or compromising each other s values. Perusing wedding blogs for fusion ideas was extremely helpful and inspiring for many of the details. Instead of having a traditional 3-day (at least!) Indian wedding affair, we opted to have our celebration include a Sangeet (traditional singing and dancing event) inviting both families the night before, and we decided that our wedding day would have a baraat, a traditional Hindu ceremony and a civil ceremony. This made the wedding day a little bit longer, but in the end it was much more fitting for our budget, allowed us to include all the elements we hoped to, and allowed our guests to attend all the festivities. I would encourage brides planning a fusion wedding (or any wedding) to communicate as much as possible with both families before making decisions, listen to others  ideas and try to honor the most important traditions to each family. Identify what elements are most important to you and your groom and pick your battles wisely.'
p794
aS'I am from Wisconsin, so having the celebration at a barn was an easy choice. We found Over the Vines in Edgerton, WI and knew that this was our venue. The property was beautiful, and I loved the elegant chandeliers in the barn. The owners, Billie and Ryan, were very accommodating to the elements of our wedding, such as having a horse on the grounds for the baraat and having a small fire for the Hindu ceremony next to their gorgeous 100-year-old barn. If you are planning a wedding from out of state like we did, find vendors who communicate well and who you can truly trust. We knew that Billie and Ryan had our backs and we spent many evenings on conference calls with them ironing out details.'
p795
aS'Gene Pease and Benj Haisch of Geneoh Photography captured our day beautifully. They are incredible talents and we will cherish our images forever. Because we splurged on photography, we needed a more budget-friendly videographer. We hired a family friend, Casey Huxtable, and he did an incredible job for a fraction of the cost. For the attire, I searched everywhere   online, Indian fashion designers, American gowns that could look fusion but I struggled to find a fusion wedding dress. I decided against wearing a traditional sari, as I knew I wanted to wear something white. Still, I wanted the beautiful Indian beading incorporated in some way. My sister Claire, my maid of honor, and I sketched out a design and headed to Dallas, Texas to meet with Prashe Shah, a talented Indian wedding planner and fashion designer. She understood my vision and created a truly beautiful garment. I love that it is a one-of-a-kind piece. My favorite element was the tulle sash over my shoulder. It had the feel of the draped sari but was light and full of movement. I found my gold tikka on Etsy. The rest of the jewelry was from family. Kabeer borrowed his sherwani from a family member and had his safa (turban) made in Mumbai when we traveled there for our engagement party. We bought our flower girl outfits in Mumbai, and Kabeer s mother had outfits made for all of our groomsmen and bridesmaids for our Sangeet event the evening before our wedding. This way, we incorporated all the traditional attire of both cultures throughout the weekend. I chose Jenny Yoo bridesmaids dresses in two shades for my girls and utilized Indian accessories with henna to create their fusion look.'
p796
aS'Thinking outside the box, using family member s talents (+ asking for their generous help!), and spending a little extra time on many DIY elements saved us thousands of dollars. Flea markets and antique stores in northern Wisconsin were my main supplier of decorations. I found amazing wooden chairs for our mandap at a flea market, and many vases were less than $1! We also found vintage cheese boxes, gorgeous old brass pieces, a croquet set, our ring box, and wooden crates. We found a vintage vanity during someone s spring cleaning on the side of the road and used that as our dessert display! Kabeer made our bags set himself following an online how-to to represent our alma maters, Arizona State and University of Wisconsin. I wanted a photo display of our families, so I asked our mothers for photos of our grandparents and great -grandparents. We framed the photos and placed them on some simple yard lattices to create a family tree of sorts centered around a photo of Kabeer and I. I thought it was a neat way to showcase the creation of a new family line. My sister is an incredible artist, and so I asked her to do our chalkboards and table numbers. There was one chalkboard that had a quote from Kabeer from a conversation we had years ago. He said  I cry when you cry, I jump when you jump, I dance when you dance  to me and I never forgot it. It was a special surprise for him to see at the reception. Writing our table numbers in Gujarati was a fun way for people to find their table. I found a farmer s market vendor from outside of Madison to supply the flowers and bridesmaid bouquets, and my aunt and cousin completed all the vases and centerpieces. We found affordable fabric in India and had gold-tasseled table runners made for our tables. We hired a florist only for my bouquet and the arrangement on the mandap. My older brother Lucas built the mandap, and it was a perfect rustic piece.'
p797
aS'Watching Kabeer make his entrance on the regal white horse, hearing the music and drummers go wild and watching our families dance and join together as his family approached mine, was a moment I will never forget. Our dholees (drummers) made the baraat come to life with traditional drumming and a music cart playing a background track. We had a traditional Hindu ceremony followed by a civil ceremony officiated by my father. We wrote our own vows and asked family and friends to play instruments, sing and read our readings. I asked my dad, an eloquent speaker and one to always entertain the crowd, to officiate our civil ceremony. Having him there added a level of comfort and humor to our ceremony that made it that much more special.'
p798
aS'Hiring a day-of wedding coordinator was our best decision. Sarah Sarbacker and her team of ladies from Cherry Blossom Events took care of absolutely everything that was planned as well as unplanned. It started raining (and eventually monsoon-ing) in the middle of our civil ceremony, and Cherry Blossom coordinated the movement of everything inside for what turned out to be a seriously stormy evening. In the panic of the rain starting, we skipped the traditional vows and my dad forgot to ask us to exchange our rings. We basically shouted  I do!  and snuck in our first kiss before the downpour commenced. We realized we forgot about the rings and quickly exchanged them before running inside the barn to escape the rain. The sound of the rain pounding on the barn roof was really romantic, and it all made for quite the memorable ceremony! We have enough good luck  from that rainstorm to last a lifetime.'
p799
aS'Madison, Wisconsin has an awesome food truck scene and we love creative and adventurous food. We worked with Christine from Slide Food Cart to create a really fun fusion menu, including homemade mango lassi and a variety of sliders including Chicken Tikka Masala sliders (Which we named Dehli-icious)! Fried cheese curds are kind of a must with any event in Wisconsin, which was taken care of by a late-night food truck visit by Fried and Fabulous. Moscow Mules are our favorite drink, so we gifted our bridal party with copper mugs and offered that as our signature cocktail. Budgeting tip: food trucks saved considerable dollars and kept our per-head cost very reasonable. My mom and I worked with my favorite hometown bakery in Wausau, WI to bake my favorite carrot cake recipe for one of our cakes. Buying small cakes for the cake cutting/display and using sheet cakes for the rest was a fabulous money-saving tip. Family members from India brought traditional Indian sweets to also offer for dessert. One of my favorite finds was our elephant cake toppers that I found in a market in Delhi.'
p800
aS'We supplied our DJs, Sound by Design, with a playlist mixed with everything from traditional Bangra music to Top 40 hits. It made the reception such a fun dance party, and everyone left with a few new Bollywood dance moves. The sparkler send-off during a brief moment of dry weather was the perfect end to our wedding day.'
p801
aS'Planning a fusion wedding was a constant balancing act, but in the end I think we highlighted and celebrated the essence of both cultures and families really well. Our day was full of vibrant details, many labors of love, and rich traditions. It could not have happened without the generous contributions and tireless energy and support from our families. It was a wonderful start to our marriage, and we will never forget it!\n'

S'I get weak at the knees when it comes to stationery and paper goods, so when I saw all of the fabulous little details scattered about this colorful wedding, my heart beat a bit quicker. But then I found out that the talented bride created it all herself, and well, I m bowing down to her. Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema captured it all and you too can join in the fun with every burst of color.'
p840
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema  We are so excited to share this beautiful summer wedding. This wedding is close to our hearts because the groom is my brother and the bride is now my sister-in-law! Maggie and Rob were together for almost 10 years before they got married, so we have long felt like Maggie was a member of the family. Rob and Maggie share a love of music, and had members of both families perform at the ceremony!'
p841
aS'Maggie is a graphic designer, and her eye for color and design was all over her wedding. Maggie designed all of her printed materials, pulling together the beautiful colors of the wedding and a strong sense of style. Believe it or not, Maggie s aunts created the beautiful florals, including the bouquets and centerpieces. We could not stop gushing over the amazing giant pink peonies!'
p842
aS'Maggie s dress was an amazing design by Hayley Paige   it was so unique and looked perfect with her vintage-styled hair and makeup by Antje Kastner and Mollie Gloss!'
p843
aS'Finally, Maggie and Rob had some unique struggles while planning their wedding. Just a few months before the wedding, their venue fell through, and they had to scramble to find a new space on a popular day in Chicago. Maggie kept her cool, though, and found an even more stunning setting for the ceremony on the rooftop of the Hellenic Museum. There are few places in Chicago with this amazing skyline view! The reception was held at Chez, which is a brand new event space right in downtown Chicago. Everybody agreed that the new spaces were even more perfect than the original!\n'

S'If I could pick any decade for a party, I wouldn t have to think twice. The 1920s had my kind of style and Jay Gatsby has my heart. So when this wedding combined classic 1920s touches with whimsy and glamour, I was sucked right in. Soir e Weddings & Events brought the couple s fantastic vision to life and Cristina G caught every roaring detail. So kick up your shoes and join me in the full gallery here.'
p881
aS'From Soir e Weddings & Events  Aileen and Kevin had a specific vision in mind when we first met with them. Aileen envisioned a classic elegance and vintage romance. '
p882
aS'We looked at many venues in Chicago, but there was always one that stood out. At each venue we looked at, they kept comparing them all to this  one.  It was newly renovated tented space, Galleria Marchetti. A lush English garden tucked away in the middle of Chicago s skyscrapers and L trains, the whimsical grounds offered the perfect setting for Aileen and Kevin s nuptials. So finally after looking at several other venues, I said asked the question they were both thinking  Why are we looking at anything else? Nothing is going to compare to Galleria Marchetti, right? .'
p883
aS'They went home to discuss it, and later that night I got the green light from them.  Let the fun begin!  The garden and tent s new oversized orb-like crystal chandeliers were what hinged much of the design. We wanted their guests to feel like they were transported into the pages of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, escorted to a lavish party suitable for the company of Daisy, Jay, Nick and Jordan. We wanted the guests to have that feeling, without going overboard or being literal with the theme. '
p884
aS'The bride then found the perfect gown. A simple sweetheart strapless gown, with an attachable peplum that she added for the reception. The Bride had her heart set on a vintage car. A vintage Bentley picked up the couple after their first look and chauffeured them around Chicago for photos before dropping them off to Galleria Marchetti for the ceremony.'
p885
aS'Aileen loved picking out the flowers. A former Cali girl, she admired all the natural floral scents that graced her California home. She very much wanted to bring some of those flowers and scents into her wedding day. We knew that flowering Jasmine Vine must be represented in her bouquet   a little piece of Cali and a piece of her heart. Aileen s Irish roots also played a big role as well. We wanted to honor her heritage and also her grandmother who couldn t come to the US for the wedding; what better way than with gorgeous monochromatic centerpieces made up of lush green Bells of Ireland? They were hosted in a metallic trumpet vase and served as the lovely elevated floral arrangements that complimented the height of the tent.'
p886
aS'Kevin loves magic and magic tricks, so the couple sourced some vintage playing cards   which happen to be Chicago World s Fair souvenirs that donned images of Chicago landmarks   to use as the place cards. The mother of the bride hand wrote each guests name on a playing card; the card number indicated what table number they were seated at, and the color (red or black) indicated their meal choice. So clever! A sign directed guests to  Pick a Card, Any Card   Just make sure it has your name on it. Go to the table that matches your number and set the card down by your glass. Your meal will magically appear!  It also served as fun keepsake for the guests. The guest book was a collection of vintage Chicago postcards; guests were asked to write out a card for the bride and groom and drop in inside a wire birdcage. '

aS'The couple had many talented friends, many of which were musicians. They had their friends take part in the wedding by playing music through the cocktail reception. They also thoughtfully curated the music for the wedding by creating a playlist of not only their favorites for the ceremony, first dances and parents dances, but they had a playlist that took their guests though each decade. Starting with the 20 s and finishing the night with music from the 80 s, 90 s, 2000 s and today. Another friend emceed the event while one of the groomsmen DJ d the later part of the evening.'
p888
aS'The day turned into night, the dance floor was packed and Aileen and Kevin hugged all their guests as they left.  The best night of their lives  was written all over their faces, and it was. One of our favorite weddings with one of our favorite couples!'
p889
aS'From The Bride  Despite sharing our junior high school years living less than one mile apart in Colorado Springs, we didn t meet until college, at the University of Colorado in Boulder. When fate decided we were ready, we met and became fast friends, sharing many hours onstage performing in various Colorado-based West African bands; most notably the University of Colorado s West African Highlife Ensemble. I was an amazing dancer, and Kevin did his best to figure out the tricky trumpet parts.'
p890
aS'Romance wasn t in the cards until after college, when we both ended up in Chicago. I was busy getting my Ph.D. in clinical neuropsychology and Kevin messing with pop-psychology as a Madmen-in-training at Leo Burnett. During our late 20s our deep friendship evolved into something more, and the  L  word (i.e.  Love ) was in play just before I embarked on my California adventure to complete my internship and post-doctoral studies at the West LA VA Hospital and UCLA, respectively. Just four short (i.e. LONG!) years later (FOUR YEARS OF LONG DISTANCE!) we reunited back in Chicago, and were soon to be engaged!'

S'When Katie Saeger Events is behind the planning and design helm, pretty things are bound to unfold my dears. A kind of pretty that has a powerful love behind it, like this beautifully rooted and spiritual family farm fete. It s a little bit of rustic, a little bit of romance, dotted with a sage-y mint and simple white blooms that pack a punch. The proof is in every lovely capture from Lisa Hessel Photography.'

aS'From the beautiful Bride I met Joel almost 5 years ago, my first weekend in Columbia, Missouri after arriving to Mizzou for my undergrad. He was my older brother s friend and in a friend group and campus ministry that I became very involved in. From the first time I met him, I was drawn to his outgoing personality and the ability he had to make everything more fun. He quickly became one of my best friends at Mizzou and after 2 years of being good friends (and some big realizations and a near death experience on a plane) we finally started dating. Once we started dating, it didn t take us too long to realize we wanted to spend our lives together. Joel makes me laugh more than anyone, he entertains me to no end, and he is incredibly thoughtful, gentle, and caring of every person in his life. He also has this ability to befriend literally every type of person.'
p941
aS'We got married May 3, 2014 in Hermann, MO on my family s farm. I grew up in St. Louis, but my family has had this farm for many, many years. We grew up going frequently to hunt, fish, play games, and spend time together.  The Farm  has become a huge part of my life and I always dreamed of getting married there. It was incredible to have that become a reality, and we are so thankful to everyone who made that happen, especially my mom and our wedding planner, Katie Saeger. (And my dad for cutting the grass so beautifully!) The ceremony was on a hillside and Joel s dad, Dave, officiated. It was personal and intimate, we wanted it to feel more like a time of worship than a wedding. My brother led everyone in some hymns and the whole ceremony felt so surreal. We had the reception in a big tent, with twinkling lights and a live band who just added so much to the overall ambiance of the night. It was an unbelievable day and words really don t do justice to the amount of love and support we received from our family and friends. Truly, a day we will never forget!'
p942
aS'From Katie Saeger Events The Farm was a dream location for the bride and her mother and we worked so closely together to make sure every little detail reflected their love for each other and their families for that weekend. The hills of wine country in Hermann, Missouri made for a really picturesque backdrop for the ceremony and reception with rolling hills as the backdrop as guests entered  the Farm  and a beautiful tent that awaited them after the ceremony. Amanda and Joel wanted a very inviting and warm feel to the day with some beautiful classic and rustic touches like the beautiful bud vases hand collected by our florist Hermann Florist and the soft lace and burlap runners accented with beautiful white and green florals. One of my favorite parts of the day was seeing Amanda and her Dad walk down the aisle towards Joel. Not having a first look was very important to Amanda and Joel, and watching them both as they saw each other for the first time walking down that aisle was such a beautiful and heartfelt moment for everyone watching. The beautiful photography by Lisa Hessel and the video from Chris Olson really captured how deep Amanda & Joel s love is for each other, and the love that surrounds them with their family and friends.'

S'Filled with plenty of wow factors, this designer bride and her college sweetheart planned a perfectly branded wedding. Every grand detail captured by Joan & Jon from the logo to the paper goods and even a marquee sign (to name a few) is reflective of their unique day and will leave you fascinated. Toast & Jam carried the celebration into the night and you can partake in the party right here.'
p993
aS'From Joan & Jon We are so excited to share this amazing one of a kind Branded wedding. Yes Branded. The bride is a designer and completed branded her day. What was also so sweet about their story is that Kari is a southern girl from Kentucky who found her soul mate who was born and raised in Chicago.'
p994
aS'Mike and Kari were married in an unforgettable candlelit ceremony at the Zhou B Art Center in Chicago Illinois. Talk about a stunning celebration! Kari is a designer and she branded her entire wedding day. Their wedding even had it s own logo which Kari designed. She also created and printed all the paper goods. Kari s father made the huge Mike & Kari marquee sign that hung in the entrance of the gallery. Their wedding had so many wow factors.'
p995
aS'From The Bride Mike and I wanted our wedding to really reflect our personalities and style. We asked ourselves at the beginning  what do we want this wedding to be?  And our answer was always we want a day for our friends and family to have fun with us and celebrate our love. Throughout the entire planning process, we tried to combine our styles and create unique details that just made us smile. The day couldn t have turned out more perfectly. Although we both put our heart and soul into the wedding, and there were many sleepless nights designing each small detail to reflect our wedding  brand , the day wouldn t have been possible without our amazing families and our insanely amazing vendors! We both feel truly blessed to have so many wonderful people help create the best day of our lives.'
p996
aS'It started with a big, southern  Hiiii . Mike was born and raised in Chicago. Kari was born and raised in a tiny town in Kentucky. In 2005, they met at the University of Kentucky. While Mike played hockey Kari watched him play (he had no idea who she was). However, once the next semester began, they had a class together (Professional Ethics to be exact). Kari, thinking he knew who she was because of the growing popularity of a website called  the facebook , stops him after their first night class together.  Hiiiiiiiii Mike! . Long (and embarrassing) story short   he had NO clue who she was. The next class, however, he sat down next to her and the rest as they say .is history.\n'

S'There s something so charming about hometown weddings, and this Omaha affair is truly heartwarming. Elegant with a modern twist, the sculpture gardens of the Joslyn Art Museum provided the perfect backdrop for Kyle Robino of Habitat structured blooms and the Bride s statuesque Vera Wang gown. It s safe to say that I m in love with every sweet moment chronicled by Dana Damewood, take a peek here.'
p1055
aS'From The Bride  Though Geoff and I met and live in Washington, D.C., we never questioned that we would marry anywhere but my hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. Nebraska remains a very special place to me, and our wedding weekend was the perfect chance to show off this vibrant Midwestern city to our family and friends from across the country.'
p1056
aS'Our goal was to plan a personal and meaningful wedding that would reflect us as a couple, while creating a unique, fun, and unforgettable weekend for our guests.'
p1057
aS'We merged the best of both worlds with our venue choice   a stunning, modern ceremony space, followed by a beautiful, green outdoor setting in the sculpture garden with a wonderful view of the city s skyline. Our wedding was a first for the museum; they had never held an outside event under a tent. And while being the first certainly came with its challenges   everyone from the caterers, to the florist and tent company had to start without any precedent in place   we were able to craft our vision from scratch and wouldn t have had it any other way.'
p1058
aS'The color inspiration for the day started with a trip to a beloved ribbon shop in New York, where I found the blue and cream ribbon that we used to tie my bouquet. On that same trip I discovered the Vera Wang gown I chose as my dress, and everything evolved from there. We added green to the navy and ivory color palette, and the look became a mix of fun, breezy, prep, grounded by modern elements and unexpected details.'
p1059
aS'Though the big decisions, like venue, were key, the small details were so much fun to conceive and implement. We collaborated with Nebraska vendors when possible, like Porridge Papers in Lincoln, Nebraska who letterpressed the invitations and printed plantable coasters that guests could take home and grow into wildflowers.'
p1060
aS'The season also dictated many of the details. We knew it would be hot, so paper fans and custom gelato from a local creamery were essential to keep the guests cool throughout the warm Nebraska night.'
p1061
aS'From the bespoke Omaha map and weekend itinerary Geoff designed, to my great-grandmother s antique lace tablecloth repurposed as the Chuppah cover, and our hand-quilled ketubah, we worked to personalize even the smallest details throughout the weekend. As a couple we share a love of traveling the country, and spent the better part of a year collecting vintage postcards from places significant to our relationship and backgrounds. In lieu of a guest book we asked our guests to choose a favorite card and leave us advice or well-wishes.'
p1062
aS'In the end, the entire weekend was a truly authentic representation of us as a couple. We could not have asked for a more beautiful three days surrounded by our family and friends in Omaha.'
p1063
aS'From Dana Damewood  I had so much fun working with Ally, Geoff, and their families on this wedding. I was so excited to hear that they were the first to have their reception under a tent outside of the Joslyn Art Museum in the sculpture garden. When I arrived on the big day, I couldn t believe how perfect all of their details were. Everywhere I looked, everything was gorgeous  I was so happy to have a client deliver so much creativity! The girls looked amazing in their blue dresses and gold accessories, while the guys sported fun ties and socks. The ceremony was set up in a way that I have never seen before at Joslyn and it worked especially well for the guests and for the photography.'
p1064
aS'The reception was decorated perfectly to complement and highlight the outdoor setting, with white and green florals, large moss table numbers created by the bride s mother, hemstitched napkins and linen table runners, and other fun details. But, my favorite part of their wedding day was the dance floor. In all my years of shooting, I have never seen anything quite like it. The band, Entourage, really knew how to keep the party going. I remember being scared that I was going to get hurt a few times but I loved every minute of it, laughing and dancing a little myself. The wedding was full of fun people with so much energy and enthusiasm   perfect material for a wedding photographer.\n'

S'From the moment that Hello Darling bouquet popped up on my screen, I knew we were in for something good. I m talking a wedding set at the Museum Of Contemporary Art Chicago and infused with cultural flair from start to finish. Anne Book Signature Style layered the day with classic-yet-totally-cool design, and Olivia Leigh Photographie? Well, she didn t miss a beat. More right here!'
p1108
aS'From the planner, Anne Book of Anne Book Signature Style Aiasha and I met only twice prior to her arriving back in the U.S./Chicago one month prior to her wedding. The entire design was done together over international calls and Skype. The first time we met in August of 2012 Aiasha had an entirely different vision of blues and more of a natural look in her mind as well. By January of 2013 she had changed her mind to wanting a different feel of soft oyster, warm soft gold, and creamy whites mixed with elements that were more natural such as herbs, berries, wood and bistro lighting. All of this needed to make sense at The Museum of Contemporary Art which is, of course, contemporary. '
p1109
aS'In order to bring together all of the different ideas in a cohesive manner that reflected the venue, we designed a lookbook complete with palette, design elements, fonts, calligraphers, menu, floorplan options, floral inspiration, basically everything. In addition to the overall design, it was important to include personalized touches throughout the entire event. For Aiasha and Charles  wedding, a few of those touches included: Playing up the museum s outdoor garden area by designing custom sips and picnic plates featuring food and drink from their home countries, hosting a traditional Henna ceremony for the bride and bridesmaids the evening prior, displaying an array of international sweets for all the guests to enjoy, and so much more.'

aS'From Eric Rudd Photography  Stephanie and Brian live in London (we first met on Skype) and the Bride is a graduate of Indiana University of Bloomington. What really stands out for me is the Bride s long-sleeve wedding dress very British/European!'
p1155
aS'From The Bride  For our wedding day, we envisioned an elegant, classic, and intimate affair   with a nod to European glamor and vintage chic. We live in London and were engaged in Paris, and wanted to honor these experiences on our big day. I chose a 1950s long-sleeved lace gown and satin Fendi heels to pay homage to my Italian heritage and love of fashion and vintage silhouettes; Brian wore a petrol-blue, 3-piece Paul Smith Bespoke suit to honor traditional English tailoring, along with Paul Smith shoes, a Gucci tie and Falke socks (all in reference to his travels). I incorporated a brooch on my bouquet that belonged to my late grandmother, and carried my father s handkerchief   my something  borrowed  and  blue  as it was ink-stained   that also belonged to my late grandfather. Brian wore antique cufflinks that I bought him for our first Christmas together in 2009. Surrounded by our closest family and friends, we were married on the campus of Indiana University (my alma mater) and celebrated with a wonderful dinner provided by IMU Catering. We chose a palette of white, cream and blush to compliment the winter season, with accents of navy to pick up the tones in Brian s suit. Our first dance song was  Si tu vois ma m re  by Sidney Bechet, which is the theme song to the movie  Midnight in Paris , one of our favorite films. We worked with the Beck Chapel organist to tailor our music choices   while the welcome music was traditional Baroque, we had U2 s  All I Want Is You , Sigur Ros s  Untitled 3  and The Beatles   All You Need Is Love  set to the organ for the bridal party processional, the bride s processional, and the recessional, respectively. Our entrance song was a live jazz rendition of Steely Dan s  Peg . All of these little details came together to make for an incredible day, but for us, the best moment was seeing each other in the chapel as the music played   after this, time stopped and the rest is history!\n'

S'There s no doubt that as a bride-in-planning myself, I search the depths of Pinterest and of course, our very own galleries for unique little touches. But the weddings I come back to time and again are simple and sweet, with subtle pieces of pretty that will sneakily steal your heart, like this affair from Jacqui Cole. Little pink bows on silverware, a basic but beautiful naked cake and effortless white florals  all together, it makes for a lovely day.'
p1186
aS'From Jacqui Cole My absolute favorite weddings to capture are when the couples stay true to themselves. It s so easy to get caught up scrolling through Pinterest and clinging to the current wedding trends. Although they are great forms of inspiration, the key is to stick to the wedding elements that you genuinely love and take it from there!'
p1187
aS'Keri and Connor did just this.From the  Roth  vineyard wine bottles to the timeless details it was just the perfect wedding for them. The men s navy suits tied in with their blush/navy/tan color theme. It certainly added a unique touch and perfectly complemented the garden wedding. Keri chose her rose gold wedding band to go with her platinum engagement ring. When I asked her where she got the idea she simply said she saw it at the jewelers and just loved it! Her Jimmy Choo flats were absolutely stunning! Keri was able to party the night away without relinquishing style :)'
p1188
aS'Personal touches throughout the wedding day are so important. Keri had her mothers wedding dress lace wrapped around her bouquet as her  something old  and she wore her Grandmothers ring as her  something blue . As the new Mr and Mrs Roth, each reception table had  Roth  vineyard wine bottles, filled with babies breath and ivory roses. Such a simple, yet elegant centerpiece. Their naked-cake was the focal point of the room! Neither Keri or Connor like cake icing so this wedding-trend fell perfectly into their hands!'
p1189
aS'Above all the entire wedding day was filled with so much love and emotion. The rain swept over and the clouds parted just before the garden ceremony took place. It was such a joy to capture an incredible couple becoming husband and wife after 10 years together. Congratulations Mr and Mrs Roth!\n'

S'If I could pick my favorite type of wedding, it would be an intimate, yet elegant dinner party under twinkling lights. One where conversation flowed right along with the wine and each guest felt like the most important person there. So I think it s safe to say I m basically obsessed with this chic, Chicago soiree from Azuree Wiitala. Every detail was curated with love, and the result was beyond.'

p1221
aS'We wanted to share our new home, along with it s rich history & awe inspiring architecture, with our friends and family from our respective hometowns. Only three of our guests were from the area. All the others flew in from Long Island, Boston, Toronto and Vancouver to share the day with us. We kept referring to it as a destination wedding in our backyard. To showcase the tradition & history of the city we decided to say  I do  at the second oldest church in Chicago, which is nestled in Little Italy. From there, guests moved east and settled in for the night on a patio on the River. With boats going by and lights from the nearby city buildings, it was a perfect representation of summer in the heart Chicago.'
p1222
aS'Everything we did was inspired by italian elegance & simplicity with unique DIY touches. I planned everything myself, designed, ordered and put together all the florals, as well as designed the centerpieces, and all the decorative details. My veil was handmade by my Mom. One of my favorite details of the day was the dripping wax effect created as the candles melted down. I think it proved to us that the truly beautiful moments in life aren t something you can plan for. I think it s safe to say 100+ more people fell in love with Chicago on Aug 2nd.\n'

p1270
aS'For florals, I decided to work with Rachel of Life in Bloom because her romantic work was perfect for the overall feel. We discussed a hanging floral piece to give you the feeling that you re actually in the gardens, and walking through the weeping willows. Small touches such as roses in the bowls were to give a nod to the water lilies that are in the Japanese Gardens, and the amaranthus that hung from the bouquet tied into the weeping willow trees.'

p1272

aS'Lastly, Kpoene from Mignonette Bridal provided the beautiful dresses for the shoot. I loved the soft colors and the ethereal feel of them. I wanted the ladies to feel feminine, and I think every girl dreams of embracing her inner child and dancing around in a a lovely dress with lots of tulle!'
p1274
aS'Every vendor came together to really bring life and love to this shoot. I am so grateful to them for providing their talents and their love, and, of course, a very special thanks to my dear friend Katie for capturing it beyond compare.\n'

S'Some of the best moments are the unexpected, don t you think? The un-planned, un-fussed-over, perfectly imperfect moments. Case in point? This sweet Groom had to change his proposal plan direction because his lovely Bride had plans to surprise him with an anniversary weekend away. Basically, they love each other to bits and are the cutest duo ever. And their wedding from Shelli Alred and MNC Photography is utter gorgeousness. Get your pretty self over to the gallery for more!'
p1322
aS'From Mike Cassimatis MNC Photography Hello and thank you for taking some time to look at Lauren and Matt s beautiful summer wedding. I absolutely loved working with this couple. Even though it was 100+ degrees outside for this August wedding, everyone was in good sprits and looking their best. Lauren and Matt chose two classic St. Louis venues for their wedding, St. Abrose on  the hill  and the classic, Chase Park Plaza. One of my favorite moments of the day was when Lauren opened a package from Matt containing all of the cards and letters she had ever given him.'
p1323
aS'From the beautiful Bride Matt and I met in February 2009 during our sophomore year at Mizzou. I spent much of that summer in Eastern Europe, unfortunately, without much communication but Matt and I were able to reconnect when I returned to the States and officially started dating August 22, 2009.'
p1324
aS'August 22 is a significant date for us. Not only because it is when we started dating but it is also the same date we got engaged 4 years later on August 22, 2013. Matts 25th birthday was at the end of July that year and, as a surprise, I planned a trip to New York City. Matts sister in law s due date for his niece, Maeve, was a day after his birthday so I decided to plan the trip afterwards so we wouldn t miss Maeve being born! As a result, I chose the weekend of our dating anniversary! I started planning the trip in February that year and Conspired with my step mom to tell Matt we d be going on a trip to Florida with my family so that he d ask off work well in advance. A couple weeks before the trip Matt took my dad out to lunch, unbeknownst to me, to ask for my hand in marriage. Matt said he d like to propose with family around on our trip to Florida (YAY! but yikes!) This put my parents in quite the predicament as it would just be Matt and I in New York City and was supposed to be a surprise! They decided they couldn t ruin my excitement for what I d planned for so long and decided they d just have to let Matt improvise (poor guy!). When we got to the airport, Matt went from really excited to competely nervous in one fall swoop when he found out we were going to NYC (which now makes sense in hindsight). On August 22, 2013 I planned reservations at buddakan restaurant and tickets to Jersey Boys on Broadway for our anniversary. Matt had a gift he was determined to give me at  the right moment  but was so disoriented by all my  surprise  plans that he decidedly/randomly gave it to me in the middle of Times Square (which was so random to me at the time to be opening a present in the middle of the street). The gift was a photo album of all of our  moments : funny, family, college, etc. and the last page declared there was one more  moment  he wanted to share and I looked up and he was on one knee proposing! We were so excited and called our family and friends and then went to see, the show, Jersey Boys, which is worth mentioning because we picked a song from that show to be our first dance song:  you re just too good to be true  by the Four Seasons.'
p1325
aS'The wedding date was immediately set to be the Saturday of the next year: August, 23, 2014. My family is Italian so there was no question I wanted to be married anywhere other than St. Ambrose Catholic Church on the hill. I knew the chase park plaza was where I wanted to have the reception immediately When we visited The Khorassan ballroom; it took my breath away! So, needless to say, when it was set up the day of our wedding it brought tears to my eyes because it was so wonderful and beautiful. Our favorite part of the wedding was my dad s sentimental speech and also the surprise he planned in arranging Mizzous fight song to be our wedding party s reception entrance song and having Mizzous mascot, Truman the Tiger, to come out with us! We were shocked when we had Truman escorting us out and everyone at their tables waving black and gold Pom poms, cheering for us! My favorite details were the curtains that dramatically opened to welcome everyone into the reception, the bar that exclusive events brought in, the MOST beautiful flower arrangements I ll ever lay eyes on-randy did such an amazing job, and the band because the dance floor was packed until the end. I ll never forget the last song that played when the groomsmen and I sang  we are young  by FUN on stage while our guests took the flowers from Our head table flower hedging and threw them onstage like a concert encore. I never wanted it to end. It was a night that will live in infamy and on replay in my mind forever.\n'

S'One of the best things about cities are the hidden gems, which is exactly what these two Groom s discovered at Public Chicago. High above the skyline they transported their guests into a quirky and modern affair featuring extraordinary views and minimalistic blooms by  Stems Chicago. Check out the stunning details captured by Annie Parish Photography in the gallery!'
p1359
aS'From the Grooms  A friend of ours had suggested the Public Hotel Chicago when we were considering venues for our wedding reception. We knew we wanted to have an intimate event with only 30 or so guests. We kept referring to it as a dinner party for our closest friends, instead of our wedding reception. We were drawn to the modern, minimalist style of the hotel because it mirrored our own tastes, and when we saw the terrace outside the Ava Room with its expansive view of the downtown Chicago skyline and peeks of Lake Michigan between the buildings, we were sold. It was the first and only property we toured, and we signed the contract immediately.'
p1360
aS'We continued the minimalist look with white table linens and flower arrangements in shades of whites, creams, and pale greens. Graceful pieces of driftwood helped to visually ground the table. Pops of color came from the place cards we made that featured whimsical robots with guests  names displayed on monitors in their chests. We had hoped our guests would want to keep them as souvenirs of the night so the cards had fun personal touches. For example, one of our friends had broken a leg in a biking accident, so her robot wore a cast.'
p1361
aS'As with all weddings, the day was a blur as we hurried to get dressed, manage last minute details, and have our photos taken with Annie Parish. Neither of us is particularly comfortable in front of the camera, but she was able to capture some really incredible moments from the night  including when we had to quickly scramble to move the event inside because a storm blew in from the lake right as we began our speeches. The wind was so strong that a bouquet of flowers flew out of the vase in front of us, rolled down the length of the table, and went over the railing.'
p1362
aS'The storm only lasted about thirty minutes, and we easily recovered with a champagne toast and dinner inside. The patio was dried off and ready to go for a night of dancing under the stars.'
p1363
aS'The evening was incredibly special because our closest friends from around the country   and two came all the way from Dubai!   made the trip to add their happiness to ours. It s very rare to have all of your best friends gathered together at the same time, so it was amazing, humbling, and made for an all-around unforgettable party.\n'

aS'Laura and Mike s wedding was elegant and simple, yet sophisticated and chic. Their exposed brick with wood beams venue matched the rustic theme perfectly. It was quiet and a little ways away from downtown Chicago, but offered unparalleled views of the city skyline.'
p1401
aS'The guests made their way in just before the clouds gathered over the city and the rain started to fall. Inside the room, beautiful French Country chairs and white freshly picked flowers lined the candlelit aisle. After a short, but heartfelt ceremony cocktail hour awaited with a full bar and miniature passed hors d oeuvres.'
p1402
aS'The dinner reception welcomed guests directly onto the dance floor. The lively band made sure no one stayed seated for too long in between courses. A New York style reception is probably the best entertainment you could offer your guests at a wedding! Sprinkled with a few toasts and the couple s formal dances, the guests danced the night away alongside the newlyweds!\n'

And it was made even more so by a layer of peonies and other pink pretties by Twisted Stem and a day captured so beautifully by Jacqui Cole Photography. Check out the full gallery for even more!'
p1435
aS'From Jacqui Cole Photography  Lauren and Tyler really created their wedding day around their own personalities. The entire day was full of emotion! From their first look, the moments before walking down the aisle to the small glances they stole at each other during speeches. Every moment was such a joy to capture! Lauren and Tyler have this visible connection where they always seems to be on the same wavelength, just knowing what the other is thinking . They are two of the sweetest, down to earth and goofy people I know! It was so amazing to be able to document the start of their lives together and so incredibly happy that these two wonderful people are now husband and wife!'
p1436
aS'From The Bride Tyler and I met in high school (but we weren t high school sweethearts!). His group of friends and my girlfriends all became friends. While we never had any interest in each other at that time, our group of mutual friends allowed us to stay in touch into college. I was throwing a party at the end of sophomore year at my apartment when our friend, Tony, asked if he could bring Tyler. I said yes and, well   the rest is history! We were inseparable.'
p1437
aS'How we picked Bull Valley is a funny story. When we talked about getting married, neither of us ever thought we would do the  traditional big wedding.  We always imagined a destination wedding with a small group of family and friends   or even going to the courthouse. However, I grew up just a few miles from Bull Valley Golf Club and my dad (a huge golfer) had always loved it so we decided to take a look. The result? We were blown away. Everything about Bull Valley is absolutely breathtaking. They were in the process of completely revamping the outdoor patio and we knew it would be absolutely wonderful. We didn t look anywhere else and booked it on the spot!'
p1438
aS'Choosing our colors was easy (pink/black/silver). It was a spring wedding and I love pink! There are so many ways to make it tasteful for a formal event. Tyler wasn t thrilled at first, so we ended up using pink more as an accent rather than a main color to keep it boy-friendly (flowers, ties, etc). My favorite part of the day has to be the first look photo session. Having that moment alone before the ceremony for me and Tyler to see each other was incredible. I think he would agree. We could both react naturally and have no distractions from a crowd. Not to mention it made for some stellar photos! He looked so dapper!\n'

aS'From K. Holly Photography A glamorous lush garden theme with varying tones of deep and light pink. Marielle and Rob planned an incredibly gorgeous wedding, and everything went flawlessly. The day started with a warm-up celebration in the backyard of Marielle s family home. The couple said their I-do s at Central Reformed Church, and celebrated with their friends and family at the exclusive Cascade Hills Country Club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The look was tied together with luxe pink flowers, linens, and details by Modern Day Floral, invitations and papers by Gwyneth Paige, and of course, the grand backdrops of their chosen venues. It felt like the event of the season, and yet there was a very intimate connection with family and faith.\n'

S'Inspired by a Liberty of London print, this Bride and her talented team of vendors created a vision of wedding filled to the brim with style and elegance. The gorgeous images from Wright Photographs paint the prettiest of pictures of their perfect day, and it s all waiting for you here. '
p1596
aS'Both my husband and I are native to the state of Illinois, him to central Illinois and I to Chicago. After investigating many venues in both locations we chose Allerton Park and Retreat Center in Monticello, Illinois. The park is an old estate surrounded by beautiful European-inspired gardens, carved sculptures, thick woods, and lush cornfields   a unique mix of our favorite locations. Our ceremony took place in the Sunken Garden on a cloudless September afternoon. To bring the aroma of France, and to allow the natural beauty of the garden to shine, we kept the space simple; only supplementing it at the beginning and end of the aisle with blue ceramic urns full of fragrant rosemary, lavender, and thyme and by lining the aisle and stairs with white petals. We hand selected the music and songs with our band, who doubled as an acoustic three piece orchestra, as well as worked with our officiant, J. Sain, to design the perfect spiritual ceremony. After the ceremony, guests walked through the gardens to the Koi Pond Terrace outside the mansion where the staff was waiting with trays of sparkling drinks and hors d ouerves inspired by our travels. After cocktails, guests descended into the oak-gilded 19th century mansion, filled with evening sun. As they passed the impassable dessert table filled with a variety of treats like bite-sized s mores cupcakes, passionfruit macaroons, and bacon brownie bites from Cream & Flutter, they entered the main gallery. Dinner tables were set with pristine white tablecloths, navy blue napkins, and stunning garden-inspired floral arrangements by Fleurish in a mix of glass vases and handmade wooden boxes Ian and I created from French wine crates. A stickler for clean, simple design, and the endless pursuit of  timeless  I supplemented the tables with menus, table numbers, and placecards of my own design alongside mercury glass and other eclectic votives filled with candles and more flowers.'
p1597
aS'While we never officially decided on wedding colors, a Liberty of London floral print became the cornerstone that brought our palette of blues, pale greens, and touch of sparkle together. We sought old world elegance in our attire. Ian and his groomsmen wore midnight blue suits from Macy s and bowties in the Liberty of London print made by the talented hands of Andrea at Pomp and Ceremony. My bridesmaids wore Amsale crinkle chiffon dresses in slate, accessorized by silver and gold hydrangea earrings (which I made especially for them!) and white freshwater pearls. My attired consisted of a San Patrick traditional lace gown, birdcage veil, Julianne Hough for Sole Society wedges, and an antique silk clutch embroidered with Czech glass beads given to me for this special occasion by an aunt. To add a final old world touch to the ensemble, I wore the diamond studded Victorian inspired earrings Ian gave me the night before as a wedding gift.'
p1598
aS'The end result was a night to remember   filled with so many special memories. Wright Photographs did an amazing job capturing the fun of the night, grandeur of the mansion, and many of the details we created to make the day truly ours.\n'

S'This Gatsby inspired wedding was true vintage glam, from the feathered florals by Town and Country Gardens, to that sparkling and oh-so fabulous hairpiece worn by the beautiful bride. Set at Royal Fox Country Club, the pretty affair had pin-worthy style, and you can check out all the day s details in a gallery by Kristin La Voie Photography.'
p1634
aS'From Kristin La Voie Photography If there s one thing you need to know about these two people, it s this: they are seriously sweet and seriously fun. Just being around them puts me at ease since they are so laid back, chill, and fun to hang out with! Let s not forget to mention Lauren is absolutely STUNNING. Oh, and Cooper  check out his hair!!! I mean, don t you just want to touch it?! These two Californians had the perfect day for a gorgeous summer wedding at the Royal Fox Country Club. I could not contain my excitement photographing them, either. Serious magic was happening before my eyes. And the details? Oh, were they perfection. Gatsby inspired details included feathers in the flowers and centerpieces, old family photos and trinkets, a giant moon for the guests to sit on in their photo booth, and Lauren s majorly stunning ensemble (with a hair piece I can only now dream about). The entire day was simply breathtaking, and the only downside is that I cannot hang out with them more often!\n'

S'I love the way this gorgeous bride describes finding the dress (you must to read it below), and I think her calm but firm attitude in dress shopping must have carried over into what was a seemingly perfect wedding day. It s beautiful and put together in a way only someone with a clear vision can do. She brought in Yazy Jo to capture the day, yet another wonderful decision, and I have no doubt the images will be a family heirloom for generations to come.'
p1657
aS'The next day I flew to NYC for fashion week, and found my dress in a Martha Stewart Bridal Magazine that I read on the flight over. It caught my eye, as I had never thought about a wedding dress before. This was timeless, beautiful and sexy. Something I thought Jason would love to marry me in. '
p1658
aS'I googled the dress and found the style at a bridal shop in NYC that I was able to visit on my trip. It was an experience like any other; I put the dress on and said,  Yes this is the one, time for margaritas!  Just like Jason, the decision was quick and absolute, like adding cream to your coffee. Simple. But yet if you did anything else it would be extremely complex. '
p1659
aS'As we planned for the wedding, we wanted to bring in as many friends and family that could support in participating their craft while putting together a very special day. My brother in law owns a restaurant that we knew would be an amazing place to celebrate at, my sister is a floral designer, my good friend designs weddings and a mutual friend wanted to marry us. Jason designed and printed all of the stationery, a good friend made the desserts, and my sister and her husband paid for the pork that was served at the meal. It was an amazing collaboration that came together seamlessly at the end. '
p1660
aS'We also took the opportunity to send a care package to Jason s Army unit that was deploying to Afghanistan in lieu of favors. We made cards for each guest that had pictures of the unit, and the address to where one could send a letter of thanks or a care package of cookies to the brave soldiers over seas. After we made the announcement of what we had done, Jason received a standing ovation of thanks from the 230 guests. It moved him to tears, as it was a memory I will never forget. '
p1661
aS'The wedding was so special for us all, and brought our family and friends together over our love. I would not have done it any other way.\n'

Overflowing with darling DIY details and loads of smiles, this gallery is not only pretty but packed with personality, leaving me head over heels for every image.'
p1705
aS'Jason and I are a pretty laid back, fun-loving couple, so we did our best to make our wedding reflect this side of us. We did not want anything too over-the top. Everything from the photo booth to the bonfire at the end of the night, it was all very much  us.  We really wanted our guests to feel like they were at a family party, but with the beauty and elegance a wedding should have and our individual personalities shining through. '
p1706
aS'We were on a somewhat tight budget and knew we had to utilize a good portion of it for our tent and caterer, so we incorporated a lot of DIY ideas (thanks to Pinterest & SMP!) and utilized local thrift shops for a most of our d cor. I am drawn toward rustic and vintage looks so I knew I wanted to incorporate both of those styles into our wedding. The centerpiece of our ceremony was a handmade arch Jason made out of birch trees he cut down himself in his parents yard. On our wedding day, we simply tied on some colorful Larkspur flowers with twine to create the most perfect rustic backdrop for our ceremony. It was absolutely beautiful, and knowing my soon to be husband had built it, made it that much more special to me. It was one of my favorite additions to our wedding and I love seeing it in the background of so many of our photos. My thrift store finds included an eclectic mix of vintage vases used as centerpieces, old picture frames that we re-purposed into chalkboard menus and seating card holders, and mason jars that we turned into hanging flower vases that adorned the aisle. After the wedding, I was even able to resell most of these items, which helped out even more with keeping our spending to a minimum. '
p1707
aS'Taking on so many tasks ourselves and trying to keep within our budget required a ton of help from family and friends  we would not have been able to pull it all off without them! Aside from the bouquets and boutonnieres, we bought all of our flowers from an awesome local wholesale flower shop and created the centerpieces and accenting floral d cor ourselves. My bridesmaids, my aunt, and some other helpful family members each took on jobs decorating on the morning of the wedding while I was getting ready in the house, allowing me to relax and take it all in. The support and generosity received from our nearest and dearest did not end there. We had a close friend of the family, who is a Pastor, officiate our ceremony; Jason s mom made our lovely wedding cake; and our invitations and programs were created by and gifted to us by two of my good friends who also stood up as bridesmaids. It meant so much to us to have our loved-ones involved in so many aspects of our special day!'
p1708
aS'In addition to all of the projects we took on ourselves, we hired some of the best local vendors that helped our day to be as amazing as it was. We used Heybecks, a nearby meat market, as our caterer, and that was one of the best decisions we made. The food was outstanding and the help and service we received was beyond expectations. To this day, we are still receiving compliments on our menu! Our tent was spectacular Blue Peak Tents did an outstanding job. The lighting they provided created an Italian caf -like atmosphere with ball lights strung throughout the tent and colorful Chinese lanterns over the dance floor. It was truly magical. And capturing all of these details and creating memories that will last us forever, were our awesome photographers Gina and Tom from Gina Cristine Photography  they did not miss a beat! '
p1709
aS'Everything came together as planned and made our wedding day all we had hoped for it to be and more. Even the unpredictable Chicago weather cooperated, and we were blessed with a pristine August day 75 degrees and sunny! Our day was a true labor of love by all involved and it was the perfect setting for the beginning of our life together as husband and wife.\n'

p1777
aS'From the Bride  When Drew and I first began planning our wedding, we knew we wanted to accomplish three things: 1) have an outdoor ceremony with sparkling sunlight, 2) include vintage family heirlooms in the decor and 3) surround ourselves with family and friends to celebrate all day long. The inspiration for the entire event was  vintage glam  and  wanderlust.  We wanted it to be whimsical, creative and lovely.\n\nThe ceremony decor included a stained glass bay window (circa 1890 England that we found in a stained glass warehouse in Arkansas) that served as an altar. I loved the concept of bringing the traditional-ness of a church wedding to the all-natural outdoor venue via the stained glass. The grey tuxes, bridesmaid dresses and flowers were all selected to coordinate with the beautiful, outdoor wooded ceremony site.\n\nOther than renting the linens and table runners, all of the reception center pieces were made using glassware, vintage teacups, pitchers, etc. that belong to myself, my mother and grandmother. We purchased wholesale fresh flowers through our florist (Poppy and Clover) to save on costs as well. The chandelier was made using a vintage wagon wheel, DIY hand-dyed coffee filter flowers, crystals and branches from trees in our yard. One of my favorite little touches was the 1930 s vintage cake topper, which we found at The Potting Shed in Chelsea, MI while visiting my grandmother. Homemade pralines, made by my Texan grandmother, were the perfect way to share my Texan heritage as a party favor to guests. The wedding love bird logos was created by our fabulous event planners at Barn Door Events. We utilized the logo on our invitations, programs and was lit-up on the dance floor for our first dance!'

aS'Our wedding day will always be my favorite day, and one that I wish I could re-live over and over again. Every little detail   from my great-grandmothers teacups on the tables, to the soft flowy ribbons lining the ceremony aisle chairs, or the soft glow of the twinkling lights streaming from the barn rafters   truly made the day a fairytale.\n'

S'When you get right down to it, this is the kind of wildly beautiful yet deeply personal wedding we preach here on SMP. From the gorgeous blush and gold stylings by Kelly Lenard to the Bride s late mother s photograph sewn into her BHLDN dress, it s everything an  I do  should be and we re got a front row seat. Lauren Balingit captured the moments, and you can get started in the gallery right here.'
p1817
aS'From The Bride On June 7th 2014 I married my Prince Charming, Mike, in the suburbs of Chicago, and my fairytale wedding came true. It was a sunny day, filled with our best friends and family celebrating the commitment we made to each other. I was lucky enough to hire Lauren Balingit, a film photographer, to capture all of the day s beautiful moments, and her fianc , Alex Balingit formerly of 27 Entertainment.'
p1818
aS'The d cor was a combination of gold, blush and pale blue, along with pieces of my favorite childhood memories. The nostalgic smells of lavender from family trips to France, several Disney elements, blue birds, and my favorite flower, lily of the valley. I remember picking the lilies in my Grandmother s garden in Indiana with my Mom. Both my Mom and Grandma, sadly, could not be present on our special day. My Mom was close to my heart though as my Aunt Cyndy sewed a picture of her in my dress. Also, for our recessional we asked our friends and family to sprinkle us with the blue bird confetti (that my aunts and cousins individually hand-punched!) to honor my Mom s beautiful spirit. Blue birds also adorned our wedding cake, tying a bow of ribbon with their beaks, similarly to how Cinderella s dress was sewn together.'
p1819
aS'I felt like a true princess wearing the wedding gown I chose from BHLDN Chicago, designed by the incredible Catherine Deane. My lovely veil was vintage-inspired as well from the bridal boutique Meringue, also in Chicago. I wore the timeless Sakura halo created by C cile Boccara from France, which further incorporated the delicate pearls that embellished my dress. I carried a vintage Whiting & Davis gold mesh bag, and my earrings were by Nadri that my Mike had given me for our one-year anniversary. The morning of our wedding day, he surprised me with a gold monogram necklace incorporating my new initials, LOM. It was an honor to wear it as part of my wedding ensemble.'
p1820
aS'The incredibly talented wedding stylist, Kelly Lenard from Intertwine, is whom I give all the credit for our wedding d cor. She communicated with me for months to bring all of my scattered ideas to tasteful fruition and beauty. I asked Kelly to incorporate as much gold into the day as possible. She misted metallic gold paint onto baby s breath, eucalyptus leaves and seeds, to enhance our whimsical theme. She even surprised me the day of the wedding with the most stunning bright pink peonies that complimented my bridesmaid s dresses perfectly! Also, as a tribute to the amazing Irish family I was marrying into, Bells of Ireland adorned the pews of the church aisle. My husband Mike and I used the cork collection filled with the memories we had shared and written on, to use for place card holders at our reception.'
p1821
aS'Two days after our wedding I was beyond excited to get dressed up again, but this time having the magnificent city of Chicago for a backdrop. Kelly Lenard created a stunning secondary bouquet for me, incorporating more vibrant colors and large garden roses, and a gorgeous floral crown. Lauren Balingit photographed us as we frolicked around our favorite city and strolled along the crystal blue water. After the shoot, Mike and I visited our favorite Irish Pub in the city, The Celtic Crossing for a pint of the black stuff. It was the perfect way to end our wedding weekend!\n'

S'Somehow this wedding was able to combine all of my favorite design elements into one big, beautiful day while infusing it with a breath of fresh air, ensuring that it was both stunning and timeless. The vintage charm was complimented by rustic details and the entire wedding was veiled in the prettiest, most colorful palette I ve seen in a while. The gallery from Climer Photography is one you absolutely won t want to miss!'
p1952
aS'From Climer Photography  This was a true old-fashioned, spring, garden wedding, right in the heart of Old Southern Hills subdivision in the Missouri Ozarks. The Australian Groom and Ozarkian Bride had lived on two separate continents for the better part of two years, and on the Groom s last trip home, merely 30 days prior to the wedding, the two decided to tie the knot! With the help of the Bride s family, with event and day of planner Rebekah Covay of Seamless Events (Chicago, IL), and day of coordinating from Stephanie Weiss of Ella Weiss (Springfield, MO), a flawless, Aussie-Ozarkian garden party, complete with a special feast with smoker, trailered in by the Mother of the Bride s Cousin, from West Virginia, set the southern-vintage-chic backyard-BBQ. '
p1953
aS'Handpicked florals assembled by a local florist, Ron, from The Thicket, adorned vintage dressed tables with mismatched china thrifted and collected by the Bride, which complimented the hand painted table numbers from local St. Louis artist, Karen Bult, while trailing tree moss sprawled the vintage pieces, holding photographic memories and goodies alike. The bridal path was lined with specially crafted wood columns, selected, chopped and sized by the Groom, held candle luminaries for the romantic evening wedding, while honeysuckle and fresh flowers were in full bloom around the property. '
p1954
aS'A lone white swan circled the lake as the guests witnessed the Aussie Groom and Ozark s bride say their intimate, heart-felt, hand written vows, as the Bride s ordained father officiated the ceremony. On lookers sipped fruit infused water from mason jars and the small congregation of guests on the Bride s parent s lake front lawn dabbed teary eyes to the couple s romantic ceremony. As the sun dipped below the tall trees and guests made their way past the vintage truck (found at a local tire shop), with it s bed filled with several fruit infused waters and gifts for the couple, they made their way to the tent under the stars. The day was perfectly soundtracked with two separate bands serenading the party, local talents, Bella Donna and Triple Play, made the festivities playlist with original gypsy jazz and Beatle s favorites, which set the tune for the clear big top party that lasted into the night and wee hours of the morning. At the event s conclusion, guests left with beautifully assembled favors of mexican wedding cakes, made with love from the Bride s family friend.\n'

p2001
aS'From The Bride I love telling the story of how Jimmy and I met because it gives me goose bumps just thinking about it! We met through a mutual friend at a bar near St. Louis University. I was with a big group of friends and for some reason, something inside me told me to find my friend Jarad. When I finally did, I found Jarad talking to Jimmy at the bar. They had not seen each other for a few years since going to school together at Mizzou. The funny thing is, Jimmy hated going to this bar and only went because it was his friend s birthday! Jarad introduced us and when I shook Jimmy s hand and looked into his eyes, it was love at first sight. Cheesy, I know- but it s true! We talked about Cardinals baseball for a long time, and I think I impressed him because we went out on our first date a week later! Over time we found out we had several mutual friends and we even got confirmed in the same church during the spring of 1999. Living minutes away from each other in the same city for 20 years, Jimmy and I often talk about how strange it was that we didn t meet sooner.'
p2002
aS'I had always thought I would get married in Texas, because that was where I was born and where my grandparents lived, and I wanted them to be able to see me walk down the aisle. With both of them passing away a few years ago, Jimmy and I knew we would now be having our wedding in St. Louis. I was perfectly fine with this, but I still wanted to feel like I was home in Texas. So Jimmy (God bless him) let me take the reins for the vision for the wedding and we used my Mexican heritage as inspiration for everything. I incorporated lots of succulents, papel picado (hand cut Mexican wedding banners), a pi ata, and we even had a pan dulce bar (Mexican pastries). I also knew without a doubt, we had to have a mariachi band because my grandfather would always hire one for my grandmother s birthday. My dad and I danced to the song my grandfather used to sing to my grandmother. Needless to say it made us all cry! I also made a lot of the d cor myself, with help from family and friends, and in the end everything turned out more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. I felt like I was back in Texas with my grandparents right beside me. Jimmy and I had the best time dancing under the banners and twinkling lights with everyone we loved most in the world. It was truly the most magical night!\n'

S'One part classic and another part modern, this wedding speaks straight to my minimalist-loving heart. It s crisp and clean with a nod to tradition (read: the bride s heirloom lace veil) and lucky for us, we get to swoon Every. Last. Bit. See the gallery from Caili Helsper right here.'
p2038
aS'From Caili Helsper  Tyson and Jackie wanted their wedding to feel modern, clean and contemporary while infusing the things that are most important to them into their day. Pashminas were given to their guests upon arrival at the ceremony, to keep warm during their sunset vows on the rooftop of Ignite Glass Studios. They kept their ceremony decor minimal, letting the skyline serve as the backdrop as they said their handwritten vows. The chuppah frame was made by the bride s father (and also used at her sisters wedding), and was adorned with lace made by Jackie s cousin. The lace on her veil was her mother s.'
p2039
aS'They chose neutral tones and lace trim to adorn the tables at the reception, using a custom silhouette logo to tie all of the details together   even the candies at their dessert table! Tyson and Jackie are from Chicago but currently live in Brooklyn. To pay homage to their two home cities, they served their guests their favorite Brooklyn pickles and late night Chicago donuts. Jackie s dad made custom takeout boxes for their guests to take the donuts home. They really did make every aspect of the day feel special and unique to them.\n'

But thanks to a little creative dreaming and a whole lot of elbow grease, they pulled off a handcrafted, vintage-chic celebration that s sure to take Pinterest by storm.

aS'Once I knew that Ryan was the man I would marry, I started dreaming of my perfect wedding. I grew up on a farm and have always had a love for the country. Ryan also grew up around farming, and we knew that getting married on a farm was the perfect representation of our future life together. I asked my parents if we could get married on their farm, and they were more than happy to get working on turning it into the perfect wedding location. They have an old vintage barn that I knew had the potential to be special. It took over a year to restore the barn for the wedding with help from our awesome friends and family. Ryan and I designed and built the window wall on the front of the barn that really gave it the quirky vintage feel I was looking for.'
p2077
aS'The day after Ryan and I got engaged, my mom and I started the hunt for the perfect wedding decorations. We had such a fun time hitting up all of the local shops and flea markets in our area, and were able to find the perfect vintage and shabby chic pieces we were looking for. We wanted every detail to have our own personal touch and I couldn t be happier with how the decor turned out. My mom and I designed all of the decor for the wedding and our dear friend Bobbie Peiffer helped us pull together all of the finishing touches. She has experience in wedding design and I knew that she would take our vintage ideas and top them with the perfect finishings.'
p2078
aS'Our parents really helped make our dream wedding come true and we can t thank them enough for letting us transform their barn into the perfect wedding location. Our guests had so much fun walking around the property and admiring all of the hard word it took to get the grounds looking so beautiful. Our wedding day was more amazing than any expectations we had and we couldn t be more thankful that we were able to share it with our loved ones.'

S'Modern weddings? They re kind of my jam. Clean lines, chic details and black + white palettes always feel fresh, and Chicago museum wedding is the latest object of my affection. Planned by Soiree Weddings & Events with blooms by Sweet Petal, it s black tie gone gorgeous, and Diana Lupu captured every last bit. More right here.'
p2153
aS'From The Bride Our wedding was a dream from the beginning to end .from our proposal to all of the celebrations with family and friends to the ultimate end, our wedding day. The night we got engaged we decided three things about our wedding: We wanted it to be soon; we wanted it to be small and intimate; and we wanted it to be a representation of us, simple, classic and beautiful.'
p2154
aS'That being said, the day was perfect . Being able to marry my best friend in the center of our beautiful city followed by a celebration filled with candles, flowers, lights floating about our heads, and a long white table filled with our closest family and friends. With the help of our amazing vendors, the entire day was carried out flawlessly. Tiffany, from Soiree Chicago, was a huge help as she and her team provided great recommendations throughout the process and made sure our day went smooth. The wedding meal, by Wolfgang Puck, was impeccable, light and delicious. Our uber-talented photographer, Diana Lupu, captured each special moment.'
p2155
aS'The night was black tie affair and our wedding party fit the bill. My bridesmaids chose their own dresses and the groomsmen wore tuxes. I found my amazing dress from Nicole Miller. Long, silky, sexy but simple. Doug wore his own tux by Hugo Boss, so classic and handsome. After eating and dancing under the stars, the night ended by leaving under a canopy of sparklers into a surprise horse-drawn carriage. And then, we lived happily ever after.\n'

With details crafted by VLD, gorgeous blooms by Passionflower, weathered furniture draped in garland and all the festivities photographed by Chelsea Brown, this gallery is just where we want to be.'
p2249
aS'From Chelsea Brown Photography  Cornman Farms is a fully functional/ educational farm and it provides much of the food for the Zingerman s restaurants and food businesses. William and Laura s wedding was the first wedding to take place on the property and the styling was designed and executed by VLD out of Ann Arbor, Michigan. William and Laura s reception featured rustic farm tables and chairs, an assortment of seasonal flowers such as peonies, tulips, and lilacs, and hand lettered paper products such as place cards, menus, a floor to ceiling bar menu, and custom coffee insulators.'

S'Real weddings are the heartbeat of our content on SMP, but every now and again we like to focus in on stand-alone design inspiration that pushes the envelope. It s the result of vendors like SQN Events who dreamt up this modern tablescape with bold prints from BBJ Linen that managed to steal the show. One part pink, one part teal, one part gold, one part coral, and all parts fabulous. More from Kina Wicks  lens right here.'
p2287
aS'From SQN Events Our inspiration for this shoot was putting a modern, urban spin on what could have turned into a very  beachy  theme based on the color palette we used (teal and coral). Of course we added a touch of gold since everything looks better with a little sparkle and metallics are hot right now. We selected a bold, pattern linen (it s brand new from BBJ this year), but paired it with classic hemstitch napkins. The oversized white leather chairs added yet another element of the sleek and modern feel we were going for. '
p2288
aS'We also challenged our cake designer to mimic the pattern of the linen on the cake and were beyond thrilled with the results. While the floral featured some romantic and lush varieties such as peonies, ranunculus, and hydrangea, spray painting some of the flowers and foliage, including succulents, added an unexpected modern twist. Choosing a linear  script  for the paper suite was also intentional; even the  script  had a twist to it since it lacked the traditional curves generally associated with calligraphy. The private dining room at NoMI (one of Chicago s top restaurants, located in the Park Hyatt) was the perfect venue for this as it features crisp white walls, windows overlooking bustling city life, and a gorgeous bold and bright art piece.\n'

S'Complete with roses and hydrangeas in the summeriest of shades, it s safe to say the fiercely talented Belli Fiori knocked this one out of the park. She put together every gorgeous floral moment, and thanks to Cary Klein, we get it swoon it all for ourselves. Have a look in the gallery and don t miss the video from Analogue Films!'
p2347
aS'Forest Park is truly one of the most beautiful places in St. Louis and somewhere we love to spend leisurely Saturday mornings, so we couldn t pass up the opportunity to get married at the historic World s Fair Pavilion. Clean lines, candlelight and the most amazing trio of floral arrangements provided by Belli Fiori for our reception at the Palladium brought to life the  modern elegance with a hint of romance  that I had been dreaming about for years. The beautiful stationery helped set the stage from the very beginning, and was all designed by one of the bridesmaids. We DIY d the table numbers to add a pop of color and coordinate with the coral ribbon on our cake.'
p2348
aS'It was important for our wedding to feel personal, very us, and a glimpse into who we are as a couple. We love to entertain and are considered the  party planners  of our group, so everyone was expecting our wedding to be the social event of the season. Talk about pressure! The day was filled with details of our life together. We love to travel and Ben had originally planned to propose on a hot air balloon (thanks,  high winds ), so that inspired our hot air balloon/world map guest book. The cigar bar was a nod to Ben and one of his favorite weekend activities. I love sparking wine, so instead of an expertly crafted signature drink we were very excited to pass flutes of Cava during our cocktail hour. Ben said he wanted to look like James Bond in Casino Royale, and I think we accomplished that goal too!'
p2349
aS'We also wanted to celebrate our friends and family and the relationships that have made us who we are today. Our toasting flutes were an engagement gift from a bridesmaid, one of my best friends and my roommate all through college. The homemade limoncello favors were most certainly a labor of love! Our best man and a groomsman helped us peel 160 lemons for this magical liqueur, made to honor our four Italian friends that traveled across the pond from Italy and Finland to be a part of our special day. The ceremony was officiated by my uncle and written by the three of us. One of our favorites parts of that ceremony was the wine box unity ritual. Many of our family outings revolve around wine! We asked both sets of parents to add a note and bottle of wine to the box to be opened on our first and fifth wedding anniversaries, and Ben and I wrote notes to each other and included a bottle of wine to be opened on our tenth anniversary. My dress and accessories also had a few special touches. My mom surprised me with earrings made out of diamonds from my late grandmother s tennis bracelet, and also cut a small piece of her wedding dress to pin inside my dress next to my heart. I wore family wedding bracelets down the aisle that have been worn by generations of brides on my mom s side, including my sister just 7 months prior to our wedding day.'
p2350
aS'The day ended with one big party! I ve honestly never seen more people dance at a wedding, which is probably due to the fact that Ben and I are usually the first people out on the dance floor at any and all weddings we attend. Obviously we d expect all of our guests to follow suit! It was truly a day of celebrations between myself and Ben, and between us and our favorite people in the world.\n'

S'For this Kansas couple, paying tribute to Lawrence, the town where they fell in love, was an important part of their wedding day. The decision to work with local vendors proved to be a huge success. Antique pink peonies from Pendleton s Country Market and three beautiful cakes from Sweetcakes Bakery were the perfect way to celebrate not only their love, but a beautiful place to live. See the rest of the lovely details in the gallery.'
p2508
aS'We were lucky enough to work with about 90% local vendors. It was important to both of us that we support our local economy as much as possible, and this infusion of local goods and services made our day truly unique. From the beginning, I knew I wanted local peonies, and our florist, Pendleton s Country Market provided the beautiful antique pink peonies. My bouquet also had white hydrangea and baby s breath, and my hair piece had white tea roses and baby s breath. The bridesmaids carried pink peonies with organically-placed fern pieces. The light pink peonies added a necessary bright and springy feel to our otherwise dark and sophisticated palette of black, dark blue and gold. I wore a full-lace gown by Ivy and Aster, with an open back and covered buttons. The bridesmaids picked their own navy blue dresses. The groom wore a J. Crew suit, and his groomsmen wore a suit of their choice.'
p2509
aS'We had a small ceremony with 50 of our closest friends and immediate family in front of a fountain, surrounded by pink rose bushes. A string quartet played Gabriel Faure s  Pavane  as my father and I walked down the aisle. My oldest sister could not make it to the wedding, as she was 8 months pregnant, so we  skyped  her in to participate in the ceremony. My maid of honor s mother officiated, focusing her marriage address on the history of our town and the value of civic spirit, public spaces, and community. In keeping with this, my dear friend Jordan wrote a small piece about marriage equality:'
p2510
aS' Kelly and Cooper also ask you to remember that the legal institution of marriage is a privilege in our society that not everyone shares. Beyond the social and economic security that the institution currently offers, marriage for many people represents a commitment to love, trust, and partnership. The desires for companionship, growth, hope, support, laughter, and a person to call home are not limited by one s sexual orientation or gender identification. Kelly and Cooper feel so lucky as a couple to legally and publicly express their love and commitment before you today and ask that you keep all people who are fighting for the same right in your thoughts. We ask you to take a moment of silence, for these and any other thoughts and prayers you carry. '
p2511
aS'One of the most special moments of our ceremony was when my friend Molly recited an excerpt from The Little Prince, even Cooper shed a tear as she reminded us all,  The essential is invisible to the eye  you become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.  Finally, Cooper and I wrote our own vows. I cannot say this enough to any future bride or groom: write your own vows! It was such an honest, beautiful moment that I will always cherish.'
p2512
aS'After the ceremony, our bridal party walked the five blocks from South Park to our reception venue. As we walked down Lawrence s main strip, Massachusetts St., people whooped and cheered congratulations. This was one of my favorite parts of our wedding, and the pictures really capture the spirit of downtown Lawrence.'
p2513
aS'The tables at our reception were decorated with peony buds in mini milk jars. The tables were scattered with homemade gold and white origami cats, which served as a symbol for our party favors: a donation to our local animal shelter. We had custom-made chalkboards for the wedding program, schedule, menu and seating chart, and I made chalkboards for our cakes.'
p2514
aS'We had three cakes made by Sweetcakes Bakery. Our flavors: Dark chocolate with local raspberry filling and chocolate buttercream, Vanilla Cake with local strawberry filling and Tahitian vanilla butter cream, and Lemon Cake with fresh blueberry preserves and lemon buttercream. This local one-woman company uses eggs from her friend s chickens, organic sugar and flour, and local berries when seasonal. Fresh peony buds adorned the cakes, and I made gold marquee letters in our initials to add sparkle to the table.'
p2515
aS'For our first dance, an old bandmate performed  I Love You for Sentimental Reasons.  And when the dance party started, we had a local DJ, DeeJay Maudrey Hepburn play oldies music. She worked with me at the University of Kansas radio station, KJHK.'

From the navy and blush pink palette to the charming golf club setting, it s everything we love about a traditional  I do  and Kristin La Voie s captures don t disappoint. Have a look here!'
p2553
aS'From Kristin La Voie Photography Where do I even begin with these two? Simply, this couple is the kind of couple every wedding photographer dreams about. Super laid back and chill, up for anything (and I do mean anything   like hiking through a weedy field in their wedding attire!), amazingly photogenic, and SO FUN! I ve been eager for their wedding ever since their gorgeous camping engagement session that still remains in my top sessions of all time catalog. '
p2554
aS'When the day started, the second I walked into this gorgeous bridal suite with perfect light and a beautiful gold ceiling, I knew my face was going to hurt from all the smiling. Megan is the most picture perfect bride; stunning and down to earth, with the most striking blue eyes and beautiful smile. Dakota is the most laid back and silly groom; super fun, super cute, and super in love with Megan. It really couldn t get any better, except for that it could. We shot so much film from beginning to end, I actually used every roll I brought and wanted more!\n'

S'It s never lost on me how incredibly lucky I am to be able to share love stories like this one day in and day out. It s a wonderful honor to showcase such an important day on our site, and when Autumn Keller is showering the soiree with gorgeous florals and Eric Houghtalen was behind the design helm I feel like we hit the wedding jackpot. And when Conforti Photography is behind the lens to capture it all, I know we have. See why here. '
p2619
aS'I was aware the girls were comparison shopping for everything including catering and my role as event planner. I wasn t going to allow anyone to take this opportunity away from me. So after a couple months of numerous phone calls, number crunching and proposals, I got an email and phone call confirming they had selected me as their planner. I was so honored and overjoyed by their decision I could barely contain my emotions.'
p2620
aS'Once the initial contract formalities were complete, the real fun began. Of course the process had many challenges. First, Amanda was accepted to law school and moved from Indiana to Austin, TX. Thus our face to face meetings soon became hour long phone conversations and very long email threads. Second, Due to all the specify details, Scheduling trips home become very delicate and time sensitive. The girls had to fly or drive back to Indiana for the menu tastings, linen selections, decor shopping, floral and decor consultations, design work, dress fittings etc. The planning process definitely had it s wealth of stress and plethora of freak out moments. I am glad we were all able to keep each other sane and no one got hurt along the way.'
p2621
aS'Lastly, as with any wedding the dreaded budget kept becoming a thorn in our sides. The biggest concern was how to achieve their goal without compromising the overall vision. Through my close relationship with vendors and their bargain shopping skills the wedding started to finally seemed logistical and on budget . After hundreds of hours and over 18 months of designing/planning the wedding weekend finally arrived.'
p2622
aS'Installation and Setup at Laurel Hall took two full days. I know everyone involved was taken back and overwhelmed by the shear beauty of the transformation of the venue. Specifically, the beautiful florals provided by Autumn brought some to tears and personally gave me goosebumps. The weather forecast was a slight concern but alas, all we had was high humidity, 88 degrees and a perfectly sunny sky. The romantic ceremony was set in the garden. The cocktail hour in the solarium was filled with the sounds of joy as the talented string duo continued playing custom arranged music. Guests gathered in the grand foyer for the announcing of the bridal party. As guests applauded and cheered, Amanda and Leslie made their entrance down the elaborate grand staircase. Guests were ushered into dinner and engulfed by the feminine and regal decor. Shades of pink linens and lighting including dusty rose, ballet slipper and blush instantly gave the room a romantic elegance. The table settings included vintage china, gold flatware and napkins rolled into a rose. Guests dined on the fine cuisine from Hoaglin Catering. Dinner was followed by the cake cutting, dessert boutique, many heartfelt toasts, dancing and a late night food station. Upon conclusion, the brides were treated to one last surprise   a pink sparkler send off and a 1938 Cadillac to wisp them away into the night.'
p2623
aS'From Autumn Keller The girls came to me initially with a distinct vision; French Rococo Tea Party. The feminine feel that they wanted included dainty, gilded flourishes, touches of lace, floral china, shades of soft pinks and gentle blushes with hints of gold. The floral arrangements that we dreamed up we wanted to have a refined garden look; gentle, graceful and lush, almost reminiscent of a Watteau painting.'
p2624
aS'From The Brides For a month, a mutual friend of ours had been adamant that we meet because  we d be perfect for each other.  He couldn t have been more right. We had an irresistible connection that made us hate to be away from one another. From the moment we started dating, we were inseparable and haven t spent a night apart in 3 years.'
p2625
aS'I (Amanda) knew within the first week of meeting Leslie that she was who I wanted to spend forever with. The first time Leslie ever said out loud that she was going to marry me was at the grocery store about a month after we met: when we discovered that we both like to put hot dogs in our Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. Leslie proposed in February of 2012 and we set our wedding date for the summer of 2014. We both wanted everything to be perfect, so we wanted LOTS of time to plan.'
p2626
aS'We re both very girly and over-the-top, and we wanted our wedding to be the essence of femininity. Most brides have to be mindful of how girly their wedding gets; almost no one gets to have a wedding that is all pink, lace, and flowers! We really wanted people to come to our wedding and say  This is so them! \n'

p2671
aS'From the Bride  Both the bride and groom come from big families, so the challenge was to make every wedding guest feel special. From the beginning, guests were greeted with their own potted succulents (planted and potted by the mother of the bride) with hand rendered name tags(created by the bride, who also designed the invitations and liners).'
p2672
aS'Bridemaids wore different navy, long dresses, which added more texture and depth to the bridal party. Dinner, drinks and dancing to the amazing Chicago Catz Band made for a reception that won t be forgotten. Gold and white details with hints of pinks and different shades of peonies and and navy added some glamour and sophistication to the classic Chicago History Museum venue.'
p2673
aS'From the Photographer  There are always many emotions involved in a wedding, almost always good. With the stress of preparation and the excitement of joining to two families together it can be overwhelming and each person can handle all these emotions differently. With that said, Maureen and Dave were kind and wonderful and did a fantastic job at simply enjoying the party they so laboriously planned.'
p2674
aS'Maureen is a graphic designer who knows exactly how she wanted her wedding to look like, but with the desire to have their guests feel special. In addition, Dave and Maureen are a lot of fun. As a photographer I try to get great dancing shots, but this wedding I found myself dancing along with the guests as well as get great dancing shots. I thoroughly enjoyed my time photographing for Maureen and Dave Curosh.\n'

p2707
aS'From Cory Weber  Heather and Reb ??s had the perfect rustic Northwoods wedding at Camp Hayo Went Ha near Traverse City, Michigan. Aside from a gorgeous location right on the lake, they put so many personal touches into the entire day complete with a boat exit! Weber Photography photographed the day on film, with amazing event coordination by Sincerely Ginger Wedding and Events. The floral design was by Premier Floral Designs, cake by Adriana ??s Cakery, and music by Joshua Davis during the ceremony and Mr. Music DJs for the reception.'
p2708
aS'From the Bride  The ceremony was in the woods overlooking the lake. Instead of a flower girl and ring bearer we had all of the nieces and nephews walk down the aisle with bubble guns. My brothers held up the chuppah, which was made out of crochet table cloths made by my great grandmother and Reb s grandmother. We lit a unity fire instead of candle that all of the guests dropped a stick into that they collected on their hike, and we lit the fire at the end of the ceremony. After Reb broke the glass we exited by canoe. The centerpieces were made of glass individually decorated by Reb and myself, each one unique. Adriana made our cake look like a birch tree with our initials engraved on it.\n'

S'Handmade and heartfelt, this darling day at  Happy Days Lodge  (even the venue s name is cute) was labor of love in the best possible way. With the help of family and friends, this couple whipped up a day they will treasure forever, and thanks to  Anna Zajac  all those priceless moments can be seen here.'
p2752
aS'From the Bride From the beginning, we wanted our wedding to be very personalized and involving our friends as much as possible. We designed the save the dates and invitations ourselves, and printed them with our friend s letterpress. We designed and printed all the wedding day decorations and programs on another friend s risograph. One of my bridesmaids made my wedding dress(!!), which included lace from my mom s wedding dress. Our musician, photographer, and cake maker were all close friends of ours. Our friend hand lettered a window with our names and the wedding date that was set up as you entered the ceremony hall. On the day of, the groomsmen and Alex set up all the decorations, and the bridesmaids and I made all the centerpieces and bouquets. Many friends let us borrow decorations. Our parents supported us and contributed an incredible amount. We had our guests request oldies songs for the dance floor, since we re not into traditional wedding music, and we didn t think our guests would enjoy our indie dance music. It all felt incredibly special and unique, and so us, because you could see our hands and our friends  hands in the making of the whole day.'
p2753
aS'When Alex and I first started dating, we took many trips to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park to hike or sit and talk. We had our first kiss there, and two years later, got engaged there. So it made total sense to get married there, and we were lucky enough to book the Happy Days Lodge, a hall I d been eyeing for a few months! They had both a ceremony hall and a reception hall in one building, which was so convenient for decorating and not having to rush from one location to another after the ceremony. It had market lighting already set up, and two giant bison heads on the wall.'
p2754
aS'The biggest hit of the night (besides dancing) was the food. If you want guaranteed praise for your wedding, get a barbecue place to cater. Our venue limited our catering options, but luckily Old Carolina Barbecue was on the list. People went back for seconds, which apparently doesn t happen very often. We also met a couple early on in our engagement that had a small business in Cleveland making ice cream, called Mason s Creamery. Everyone loved them as well, and didn t even miss not having cake.'
p2755
aS'Favorite Memories from the Wedding:'
p2756
aS'Alex (Groom):  Because the venue was small, and because Katey and I had chosen not to see each other before the ceremony, we had to switch off waiting in our respective restrooms. The groomsmen and bridesmaids acted as  lookouts,  and we were always told ahead of time when the coast was clear before leaving. It will always be a favorite memory of mine. It was a good time bonding with my groomsmen and my father.'
p2757
aS'Katey (Bride):  My favorite memory was walking down the aisle and realizing that almost everyone I knew was in the same room. Beforehand, I didn t think it would be a big deal ??but I knew the trouble some of them went through to get there, I knew the events that had fallen into place to let some of them be able to make it, and I knew of others who couldn t make it that day. Even after the ceremony, as we stood in the receiving line, I burst into tears at the sight those people. I just felt really loved that people traveled so many miles to be there.'
p2758
aS'Advice to Those Planning Now:  Do small bits of planning at a time ??which means that you have to start early on things and work consistently throughout your engagement. Don t put things off until the last minute, and don t try to cram too much into one planning session. If you re too stressed or tired, it s okay to just hang out and watch a movie instead. Also, let your friends and family help. I (Katey) had a hard time doing this, but it s physically impossible to get it all done by yourselves, especially the day of.

p2803
aS'In May 2013, Amanda summarized her wedding as follows and she believes their day held very true to these words!:  My four wedding words are classic, elegant, timeless, and romantic. Our colors are  bright neutrals    white, champagne, and gold (with pops of coral). Our rehearsal dinner will be at the University Club, and both the ceremony and reception at the Madison Club. There will be approximately 150 guests. My favorite flowers are peonies. The girls will wear long champagne chiffon dresses. The guys will wear plain black suits. Overall, I envision a simple, heartfelt ceremony (we re writing our own vows), an intimate (or as intimate as 150 can be!) reception with lots of white, and one heck of a party. Our taste is simple yet elegant. The venue is almost masculine (an older, establish space with lots of history) so I want to add soft full flowers and touches of gold and coral. Nick and I also love traveling (I collected 5 passport stamps last year and Nick probably collected 10) so I also want to include this passion of ours somehow. '
p2804
aS'From the bride We wanted to stay true to ourselves and make sure the day, and everything in it, meant something to us. It was important to us to keep the event as small and intimate as possible (for us 150 was small!) and to also exchange hand-written vows.'
p2805
aS'After toying with the idea of a destination wedding for about a week, it was an easy decision to decide that Madison was the perfect location for our wedding. The city we are both from, the place we met while students at the UW, the location of our first home   Madison will always be home and have a special place in our hearts.'
p2806
aS'I m not even quite sure how the Madison Club came to mind, but after exchanging a few emails with the staff and seeing some photos, we were almost positive it was exactly what we were looking for and it only took a short first look at the venue to know for sure. The location was ideal, the food was well-known to be really great, and it had the character and feel we wanted.\n Rather than DIYing everything, we worked with a fabulous team of vendors who brought our vision to life better than we could have imagined!'
p2807
aS'I d love to say the whole day was our favorite moment because it truly was more than anything we could have dreamed, but three moments stand out '
p2808
aS'1) Our first look. Taking photos before the ceremony meant that Nick and I would see each other before but we were totally fine with that idea. And actually, having that time just the two of us before the craziness of the day really started was very special   I ll never forget those first few moments we got to spend together.'
p2809
aS'2) The vows. It was important to both of us to write our own vows and that decision might be the best one we made for the entire wedding. Hearing Nick s vows to me was one of the happiest and most blessed moments of my life thus far, and having the chance to read mine to Nick in front of our nearest and dearest meant so much.'
p2810
aS'3) The moment right after the recessional. After we were pronounced husband and wife we excited the ceremony room for a few minutes before greeting guests at their seats. As soon as we got to that other room, we hugged and started immediately crying because we were both so incredibly overwhelmed with happiness. We were literally so happy we burst (into tears) :)'
p2811
aS'As for advice to other brides, make sure you stay true to yourselves! I think a wedding should reflect who you are as a couple and be filled with things you love and elements that are important to you.'
p2812
aS'And, your bridal party matters! They are your support system during planning but also on the most important day of your lives. Surrounding yourself with people who know you and that you can count on is invaluable.\n'

S'When it comes to classic weddings, visions of full-length dressed  maids, bunches of white blooms and a glowing reception come to mind. But when that vision has the touch of elegance that this one does, it s taken to a whole other level of awe-inspiring beauty. Jeffrey Sampson sits behind every lovely moment, ones that will add an extra twinkle to your eye today. Have a look for yourself right here.'
p2852
aS'From the beautiful Bride  One of the most important things to us was music   first the ceremony music   both the songs and the vocalist   and then the band. I wanted the music in the ceremony to make everyone, including Thom and I, get that same feeling you do when you watch a really deep TV show or movie, haha. The ones that give you that lump in your throat, shake your core and make you feel alive. I by no means want to put church music down, but there songs that make me feel more spiritual than those in the Gather Hymnals if you will and it was important to get to use those songs in the ceremony'
p2853
aS'We spent countless hours thinking up our favorite songs about love and life and good. I compiled so many word documents with lyrics and looked up videos of acoustic versions in female voices. After we condensed our Spotify playlist down (for the 100th time) to our top 10 or so, it was time to decide where to put each song   it was a lot like choreographing the ceremony. In my opinion, the timing and placement of the music in the ceremony can make such a big difference. Looking back, the ceremony music   both the songs AND Tara s voice   is one of my favorite parts of our entire day.'
p2854
aS'My dress. What I had in mind was nothing like the dress I ended up getting. I never thought I would wear a strapless, poofy gown however the second I tried this dress on, I knew it was it. I absolutely loved all the custom details we added to the dress   these details made it mine and made me feel like the bride I had always dreamed of being. We added a big champagne bow to the back that had detachable tails, a designer crystal belt, and most of all, the longer train! My favorite thing about the dress had to have been the train. Since the church was so massive and gothic, the long train and Chantilly lace really seemed fitting. Another one of my very favorite parts of my dress was my veil. My veil was also my  something borrowed . My cousin, Leigh was one of my Matron of Honors and she wore it in her wedding. It was her mom s (my aunt s) and so not only was it super gorgeous, but it had a lot of meaning behind it and it was such an honor for her to lend it to me. My  something old  was the jewelry my nana let me wear   the vintage diamond necklace, diamond bracelet and pearl ring were perfect with my dress and made me feel like a Queen. My  something new  was a pair of earrings my friend picked up for me last minute and my  something blue  was a new pair of light blue hanky panky s . One thing I underestimated was how much the dress would set the entire  theme  and  tone  of the wedding. Immediately after we found the dress   I knew exactly what I wanted the wedding to be like and was able to start making more decisions and acting on them. I never thought that the dress would have such an effect and be what kicked everything else to start falling into place.'
p2855
aS'Paper. I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted the invitation to look like and Allie was very helpful in working with me. We hopped on a Skype call a few times and did the whole thing over the phone and web   pretty cool! I wanted classic and ethereal with a touch of whimsical. I love paper like I said   so paper was important. I wanted to incorporate the outlines of California (for Thom) and Nebraska (for me) and I wanted our names to be in Allie s whimsical calligraphy so we could use it as a logo and incorporate it in other elements of our wedding. Lastly, I definitely knew I wanted to use vintage postal stamps to again incorporate California and Nebraska and because I thought it made the invite more personalized to Thom and I, helped set the eclectic tone of the wedding and added a pop of color (which in turn also made it stand out in your pile of mail).'
p2856
aS'Flowers. My bouquet was amazing. Peonies are my all time favorite flower and they were in season! The hand tied bouquet Mullhalls made for me was beyond perfect   even better than I imagined. I was blown away when they gave it to me right before I went outside to meet Thom for our  first look . It was huge!!! We wrapped it with the fabric from my mom s veil from when she got married. Her veil would not have matched my wedding dress so rather than scratch the whole thing, she offered taking some of the fabric off and wrapping my bouquet with it for good luck and to have a piece of her with me. I loved that. It was super special. I loved the bridesmaid s bouquets so much. I loved that the girls had to let the white and blush pink astilbe rest in their arm instead hold it of with their hands and loved the way the champagne ribbon from the bow fell. It was elegant and natural and ethereal and unique all at the same time. At the church, we lined the pews with ivory tulle, a champagne satin ribbon to match my dress, a vendella rose, champagne feather and maidenhair fern.'
p2857
aS'Decor. One of my very favorite things was all of the vintage wedding photographs Thom and I gathered from our families and dispersed through out the front entry room. We labeled each with who they were, their wedding date and how we were related. It set a very romantic tone and inspired fun conversations as people arrived. We used different types of eclectic and vintage frames that we had from home or bought at Ross and Hobby Lobby. I loved the natural and garden and ethereal feel of the reception d cor. The up lighting, candlelight, and hanging soft yellow bulbs from the ceiling created such a beautiful ambience. There were different centerpiece styles dispersed throughout the tables in the ballrooms. All of the tables had mercury vases of all different sizes with monochromatic garden roses, peonies and blush ranunculus. The head table was centered with silk ivy and giant mercury candelabras, column candles and glass bubble balls. Other tables had a giant gold artsy sculpture on them that twisted and turned up and had ivy plants intertwined and moss balls and stacked candles on each  branch . Other tables had big round bowls with curly willow sticks sticking out of the center, filled with moss balls, white blooming begonia plants, succulents and other textural elements. We used greenery to hang off the ends of all of the fireplace mantles. The flowers were beyond amazing and really set the scene. It was beautiful.\n'

S'I need to profess my love for this wedding, and yet I don t know where to start. The ceremony backdrop will make your mouth drop right to your desk, the reception is elegant with a fabulous mix of urban and rustic (complete with full size trees), and this couple just couldn t be more adorable if they tried. It will only take one look at these gorgeous images from Heather Cook Elliott Photography to see why I can t stop gushing   and you can join me in the swoonfest here. '
p2930
aS'From Heather Cook Elliott Photography Lindsey & Tim s wedding day was beautifully styled and made for general photographic awesomeness, but despite the fact that this gallery is full of photographs of all their lovely details, I must write that their wedding day was really and truly about love   the love they share for one another, the love they ve been blessed to grow up with and the love they ll have for their future family. Tim & Lindsey met in medical school at Mayo and are starting careers at a prestigious institution out east so yes, they have really good resumes, but at their wedding Tim & Lindsey s big, happy hearts were what anyone noticed and everyone cared about most. All day they exuded a joyfulness that touched everyone around them, that threatened constantly to well up and over into tears, that made everyone present grateful to be a part of such a day. But Lindsey & Tim didn t just absorb well-wishes   they continuously gave them back (as I suspect is the norm in their everyday lives) and delighted guests with, delicious foods, sights to be seen, games to be played, dances to be danced and even a meteor shower to be enjoyed. And they said Thank You in a most memorable way. After the toasts and dinners had been enjoyed Lindsey and Tim stood proudly in front of all their guests and told everyone about how lucky and blessed they are to have amazing families, parents and friends. Their parents, they said in particular, had formed them, modeling healthy marriages and lives well lived such that Lindsey and Tim have no doubt that they too will have a happy marriage. And as her dad teared up, Lindsey confirmed what everyone instinctively feels about the two of them   they are ready and excited to make each other the ultimate priority and build lives worth celebrating together. She simply said  mom, dad: we got this. '
p2931
aS'And a note about their style   Lindsey & Tim adore their urban warehouse venue but wanted to bring a bit of rustic Wisconsin loveliness to the whole thing. They selected barn tables and soft florals plus live full sized trees (!) to soften the venue s concrete, timber and brick architecture while mix and match linens and glass chargers dressed up their different shaped dinner tables. They custom upholstered lounge furniture and candle lit as much as possible, adding puzzles, bean bag toss and a band to keep the fun quotient high. Their paper was simply to die for   letterpressed and totally customized to share more details about their old, new, borrow and blue, as well as their gift of education to a needy child in lieu of favors. Their vows were screen printed on large swaths of fabric and hung first in the ceremony space and then as a backdrop to a dance floor lounge   very chic, very urban but still somehow romantic and rustic.\n'

p2961
aS'From the Bride Being a wedding photographer myself, I thought of my whole wedding in pictures. I have been obsessed with wedding since I was little and have been reading wedding blogs and magazines since way before I even met Brian. I knew I wanted something rustic and vintage but I also wanted to try not to do the same thing as everyone else. One of the most important things to me in planning our wedding was that everything reflected us and who we are. I knew immediately that I wanted to use my vintage camera collection and thought that centerpieces would be the best way to use them. But I also wanted to include Brian in them so we decided to use potted herbs because he is a cook and is amazing with seasonings. We both love to read and I love old books so we added those as well as teacups that we collected at thrift stores over the many months before the wedding.'
p2962
aS'We looked at a lot of venues but nothing seemed quite right until we found The Hitching Post. The outdoor location for the ceremony was perfect and I loved the look of the inside of the barn! We also loved that the venue was very open to our use of different vendors.'
p2963
aS'I am very crafty and a DIY kind of person so I knew that I wanted to make a lot of the stuff. My mom sewed the flower girl dresses, the groom and ring bearers vests, all of the guys  ties, some of the banners, and personalized monogrammed totes for the bridesmaids. She also made all the cards that we used for our guest book. She is amazing!'
p2964
aS'I made my bouquet out of a mix of thrift store, vintage, and Hobby Lobby door knobs. It was very heavy but so perfect! I also made my necklace and also necklaces for all the bridesmaids. I handmade Brian s ring which turned out great. I hand painted all the signs, made all the boutonnieres and corsages, and the banner above our head table. I designed all the stationary including the save the date, invitations, menu, other cards for the tables, and the programs. I really wanted everything to be personal and meaningful.'
p2965
aS'My dad built the picture display and also collected, grew, and did everything with the herbs. He also painted and stenciled all the little wooden signs that were given to our guests as favors. He also made the awesome wedding sign that we put out by the road. He surprised me with a whole succulent garden on the day we went to decorate. My parents and brother helped assemble the programs and the place cards. I really have a wonderful and helpful family.'
p2966
aS'Lots of other friends and family helped out too. My matron of honor made all the bridesmaid bouquets; other friends did the flower arranging, several different friends and family members made the treats that were on our dessert table. It was great having desserts that were personalized- my aunt made her peanut butter fudge that I have grown up with, and my grandma made her caramel and chocolate dipped pretzel sticks which she has been making for years. We made sure to include some of our favorite desserts.'
p2967
aS'I let each of my bridesmaids pick out their own dresses because I wanted them to have something that they liked and that they could wear again. One we even found at a thrift store for $15! Brian has been wearing converse shoes since he was a baby so we knew that we had to have all the guys wear them.'
p2968
aS'Kelly of Kelly Sweet Photography did our pictures and did a fabulous job! She captured the day perfectly and I love how the pictures turned out!'
p2969
aS'I seriously could not have asked for a better day. The whole day went so smoothly. It rained a bit in the morning but the weather was absolutely perfect for the rest of the day. It truly was the best day ever and I got to marry my best friend. We both had so much fun and are so thankful to our friends and family who joined us and made the day so amazing. I miss it already!'

aS'From Lisa Dolan Photography Rita and Kevin got married outside of St. Louis at the prettiest park, with a reception following at the Rustic Quail Ridge Lodge.'
p3001
aS'Rita and Kevin are two of the sweetest people you will ever meet. Their wedding was simple and elegant and filled with the most thoughtful details. They brought in tons of natural elements to create a beautiful and rustic wedding.'
p3002
aS'Rita and Kevin chose hues of purple and lavender to accent the pretty summer scenery at Quail Ridge Park. The flowers were a mix of purple roses, hydrangeas, and succulents with a few pops of fresh lavender created by Merry Me Flowers. The groom wore a boutonniere made of sprigs of fresh lavender. The bridesmaids dresses were a light lavender color which really made the bouquets stand out. One of the most special touches from Rita and Kevin s wedding were the lockets on Rita s bouquet and Kevin s boutonniere. Rita s locket contained a photo of her father who had passed away, and Kevin s had a photo of his mother who had passed away. It was such a lovely way to remember their parents, and to celebrate them on their wedding day.'

aS'The dessert bar was crafted by SweetArt, and was a mix of cookies and cupcakes instead of a traditional wedding cake. The cupcakes included chocolate, vanilla, and a special lavender cupcake all made by SweetArt.'

S'Intimate, lovely and filled with so much love you can feel it through the computer screen, this backyard beauty captured by Anna Page Photography warms my heart right up. It s overflowing with too many darling DIY details to list, but thankfully you can devour every gorgeous moment of this stunning soiree right here.'
p3044
aS'When we started planning, and figured out how expensive everything wedding-related is, we decided to seek out ways to do and provide a lot of things ourselves for the wedding. That started by choosing the wedding venue, which we decided would be in my parents backyard in my hometown of Urbana, IL. Gunnar and I are both very outdoorsy and family oriented, so this location was the perfect fit for us.'
p3045
aS'When planning the wedding, our number one goal was to have a party that brought all of our different friends and families together to have a good time. In order to accomplish that, we wanted to there to be plenty of things to do to enable a great celebration. We decided on having a bench filled with jars of jam to greet our guests as they walked in to the backyard; a whiskey and cigar bar for backyard socializing; a beer-garden inspired arrangement of two long tables where everyone sat to eat and chat for dinner; a dance floor under the tents to dance the night away; a station with madlibs, advice cards, and a Polaroid camera to allow our guests to personalize their page in our guest book; and later in the night, a bonfire with accompanying s mores to round out the evening. Oh!, and my favorite installment, we converted my parents backyard cottage into a room dedicated to the many delicious deserts provided by our caterer and the delicious cake and cupcakes by Cream and Flutter.'
p3046
aS'Our DIY theme continued as Gunnar and I, with the help of many family and friends, started to tackle wedding-related projects. Gunnar is an avid homebrewer, and made two homebrewed beers for our wedding day. My friend (and bridesmaid), Ashley Benson, and I made the save-the-dates and wedding invitations by hand. Ashley also made all of the place card nametags and signage for each station as well as the escort board. My mom, with the help of her friend Patsy, made the beautiful blue napkins that would be at each place setting. To make the stations, we collected tables from around my parent s house and bought vintage frames for the signage. The boxes used for the flower centerpieces at our tables were the drawers to my parent s Chinese apocathery chest. My mom and her friends scoured Champaign-Urbana, and the surrounding towns, for the jams we would give out as favors, the lavender we would place at each place setting, as well as many other odds and ends. In the last week, every one pitched in to put together the s mores bags and set up the backyard. We tried to put our special touch on everything that was part of our wedding day, and while it was quite the process, with many late nights of planning and crafting, it was well worth it in the end.'
p3047
aS'To complete our perfect day, we had amazing vendors that provided flowers, tents, and food. Getting ready, we had makeup done by the women from my mom s cosmetics business and a family friend doing our hair. And, a spectacular photographer to document it all!'
p3048
aS'When we picked our wedding date of May 3rd, we knew it was a gamble weather-wise. In the Midwest, an early May day could be freezing cold and raining to scorching hot and humid. But when our day finally arrived, it could not have been more perfect. The weather was warm and breezy, the sun was shining, and the garden flowers were just starting to bloom. We had eighty of our closest family and friends together on a perfect May day. I tear up at the thought of how wonderful it truly was. It was the most amazing day for Gunnar and I to start our married life together.\n'

She takes an editorial approach to just about anything she captures, and when a stunning St. Louis affair is at her fingertips, you know she ll deliver. BIG time. Head to the gallery for a first-hand peek and don t miss the film from Sweet Tea Media.'
p3084
aS'From the Bride and Groom  We met through mutual high school friends four years ago when we were in college at different universities. We both grew up in St. Louis, and were in the same extended social circle during high school, although we had only met each other in passing. Our mutual friends introduced us when we were both home for the holidays and we hit it off. As the first few dates came and went, we both found ourselves asking the same question: Where have you been all this time?'
p3085
aS'Oddly enough, our relationship was fostered over long distance in the first two years. It goes without saying that it was difficult, and being away from our families only made it more so. Fortunately, we each were given opportunities to return to our hometown. We knew we wanted to continue our lives with all of our family and friends surrounding us, so we jumped at the chance.'
p3086
aS'Returning home truly cemented our relationship. Marriage was always in the back of both of our minds, but this made both of us certain that we wanted to be together forever. Just over a year after returning to St. Louis, we got engaged at a rooftop restaurant. Rustic string lights illuminated the border; the Arch was in the distant background; both of our families were hiding inside; it was perfect.'
p3087
aS'We envisioned a warm, elegant, classic wedding. We are so grateful for the unbelievable efforts of all our vendors, the incredible planning help from both of our mothers, and the outpouring of love from our families and friends that made our wedding perfect in every way. We had so much fun creating personalized touches throughout the day including the St. Louis themed welcome boxes that greeted each traveler at the hotel, the homemade chocolates that served as favors and place cards for our guests, the family wedding photos displayed in the cocktail space, and pictures of the bride and groom that adorned each table.'
p3088
aS'And it wasn t just the wedding day that was so spectacular. The entire weekend was filled with friends and family; laughs and love. Our weekend began with a fabulous rehearsal dinner in the same building where we got engaged, and ended with farewell brunch and a family outing at a St. Louis Cardinals baseball game the day after the wedding. From start to finish, every moment of every event was wonderful. And we had the perfect person with us to capture it all.'
p3089
aS'We are so happy we chose Clary Pfeiffer   we fell in love with the beautiful work she does. Clary has a way of making everyone feel relaxed and natural. She perfectly depicted the details of our day along with all the love that we have for each other. Furthermore, she captured many of the details that we missed, and did so in a way that allowed us to relive the day. Her ability to capture a moment, whether staged or spontaneous, was truly amazing.\n'

S'I m all about breaking the  mold  and when it comes in the form of one absurdly cool shoot from Magnificent Milestones, you better believe things are about to get good. Inspired by the  60 s Pop Art movement and translated into a wedding setup  - not to mention the most amazing floral backdrop by Dilly Lily - the gallery from Amanda Hein is modern bride s heaven on earth.'
p3118
aS'From Magnificent Milestones One of the most familiar representations of Americana and the party decade of the 1960s, the Pop Art Movement also acted as inspiration for this colorful shoot. From bold, saturated colors and fonts to cheeky floral portraits of the bride and groom, the details came together to create a party as lively as the couple it celebrates. This perfectly executed shoot, captured by Amanda Hein Photography, drew on the spirit of sheer joy and vibrancy that can be found in Pop Art and in celebrations of love everywhere.'
p3119
aS'The crisp, clean venue of Chez-Chicago, new to the city of Chicago, added contemporary glamour to the festive details and provided an elegant backdrop to the amped-up color palette of the d cor.'
p3120
aS'Invitations, menus, and other punchy paper pieces created by Magnificent Milestones used multiple Pop Art elements, from geometric designs and patterns to ultra-Mod fonts. Splashes of lively pinks, oranges, yellows, and reds reflected the energetic soul central to Pop Art. Even Andy Warhol s iconic Campbell s Soup Cans made an appearance, acting as labels for veggie chips as colorful as their surroundings!'
p3121
aS'The expertly selected floral arrangements, done by Dilly Lily/Christine Noelle Design, were a kaleidoscopic vision of hot pinks, sunny yellows, and vivid tangerines. The floral mosaics of the couple drew on the work of Roy Lichtenstein another respected Pop Art personality. Renowned for his comic strip-inspired paintings, Lichtenstein used large dots in bold colors in the same technique used to print graphic novels and cartoons. These playful portraits added an ultra-personal touch while keeping with the lighthearted theme.'
p3122
aS'The floral centerpieces and the bright white tables from Tablescapes were a match made in heaven. The crisp, clean surroundings were reflected flawlessly in the simple, bright white furniture, creating a stunning contemporary canvas for the Pop Art-inspired details.'
p3123
aS'This play between contemporary flair and Pop Art playfulness was further repeated in the fabulous fare from Entertaining Company from the vibrant, fresh green color of the chimichurri and triangular shapes of the New Zealand baby lamb chops, to the bold circles found in the Round Crabcake and the Layered Vegetable Tian with heirloom tomatoes, to the vibrant Blood Orange Martini. We absolutely loved the application of geometric shapes and bright colors found throughout the shoot!'

S'I have a tendency to gush about things (rightfully so, I suppose, since I do spend my days knee deep in pretty), but if there ever was a wedding worthy of a serious gush-fest, this beauty captured by Leo And Jenny Photography would be it. Perfectly planned by this gorgeous Bride s sister, every detail is not just beautiful, but filled with love   leaving me head over heels for this gallery.'
p3180
aS'We knew we wanted our wedding to be romantic and beautiful, but also wanted to throw an awesome party for all of our friends and family. I had always dreamed of having an outdoor wedding, and when we discovered that Lake Park Bistro, one of our favorite restaurants in the city and the place we celebrated our engagement, did tented weddings, we were sold.'
p3181
aS'With the venue set in a tent at Lake Park Bistro overlooking Lake Michigan, truly the rest wouldn t have gotten done without my sister/MOH/wedding planner/coordinator, Amanda. With her eye for aesthetics and style that I will never understand, she planned the most perfect day that Josh and I could ever have imagined. From the cocktail hour on a staircase that looked down on the lake, to the sea of blush flowers that greeted guests in the tent, to the rocking band that kept the dance floor packed all night and Leo and Jenny that captured it all, our wedding was our definition of perfect. We feel so blessed, and only wish we could go back and do it again!!\n'

Feast your eyes on the gallery and take a peek below for Revelry Creative s fabulous gold heart arrows!'
p3224
aS'From Studio Finch Photography  Gold, Arrow infused with antlers and whimsical florals bejeweled with antique turquoise jewelry was the inspiration for this rustic styled shoot in Chicago. We wanted to emphasize a woman s strength and pair it with a soft whimsey and rustic elements paired with gold. The whimsical tulle dress contrasts beautifully with the strong curves of the antlers and the golden arrows. Turquoise added the pop of color along with the pinks and blushes in the florals. Allie Hasson provided amazing watercolor invitations to be paired with Artifact Vintage s amazing collection of antique bridal jewelry. Rustic, Whimsical and Timeless. Project Runway s Kate Pankoke of Elaya Vaughn paired the shoot with a beautiful tulle wedding gown.'

Danielle from BHLDN Chicago helped to style this shoot with me and we got to use BHLDN s seriously amazing gowns and products. Danielle introduced her friend Kate from Chicago Vintage Weddings and voila, we bring you this amazing collaboration I am honored to be a part of.

S'This wedding right here?  It s awesome and then some.  The kind of awesome that comes with drop-dead gorgeous traditional details, seriously sweet purple + peach hues and a ballroom reception perfectly styled for celebrating.  Oh, and on top of all of that lovely is a bride and groom who are the epitome of adorable with their super cute story.  See it all captured by Love Tree Studios right here.'
p3334
aS'Purples, peaches and grays set the tone for this simply elegant wedding on June 22, 2013. Friends and family traveled to the heart of Missouri to the surround Katie as she walked down the aisle in her stunning Watters dress, complete with hidden pockets, to wed Andrew in the local Methodist church. The flowers and bouquets were a stunning array of pinks, purples and peaches and were all uniquely designed by Ruth at My Secret Garden. Katie carried photographs of her grandparents in her bouquet in order to keep them close in her memory as she walked towards Andrew to say  I do  and place his grandfather s wedding band on his finger. The band had previsously been engraved with Andrew s grandparent s wedding date, and Katie had it also engraved with their wedding date to continue the tradition. The celebration continued in the ballroom of the historic Tiger Hotel where quests were greeted with exquisite tables-capes and scrumptious cupcakes as they celebrated with the newly wed couple.'
p3335
aS'From the Bride  Andrew and I met while attending Mizzou. I was in my second year of law school and was a teaching assistant for an undergraduate Business Law course in which Andrew was enrolled. About a year and a half after the class was over, I received a Facebook friend request and a sweet message from a very attractive guy. His message stated that he wasn t sure if I remembered him, but that I had left an impression on him and was curious if I would like to get together. I said yes and we met for dinner a week later at his favorite restaurant, which is also where we had our rehearsal dinner. We hit it off immediately, neither of us wanted the date to end and we have been together since that day.'
p3336
aS'It was just another Monday, or so I thought. June 4, 2012, I received an email at work from Andrew stating that he had a surprise for me when I got home from work. I really didn t think anything of it because he always has little surprises. I was making dinner when he got home and he told me told me to reach into his suit pocket. In his pocket he had two tickets to a Royals game  - he was trying to get me to think he was proposing   sneaky! Because he frequently pulls my leg, I thought nothing of it and our night went on usual, except, he was acting incredibly nervous. Because it was a beautiful night out we decided to sit out on the patio. After a few awkward minutes, he was more nervous than on our first date! He got down on one knee and proposed. A few minutes later, he pulled out the most beautiful ring that he had designed with stones from his grandma s ring.'
p3337
aS'Inspiration, color, shape, and design for our wedding came from a flower arrangement I pinned on Pinterest.'
p3338
aS'I used the flower arrangement/bouquet I had seen on Pinterest for color and overall theme. I wanted all the flower arrangements to have a round shape. As for flowers, Ruth Lahue at Secret Garden picked all the flowers.'
p3339
aS'My dress was by far my favorite  detail  if you can call it that, it had pockets! I also loved the pictures of my grandparents, who were unable to make it to the wedding, secured in my bouquet.'
p3340
aS'What stands out to me is how incredibly blessed and at peace I felt. Starting on Wednesday night our family and friends started pouring in from all over. Andrew and I were overwhelmed by all of the support and love we felt from family and friends. I think that is something that neither of us will ever forget.'
p3341
aS'The Tiger Hotel offered an unmatched all in one package. The food was to die for, the bridal sweet overlooked the University of Missouri, they had a great wedding coordinator, an incredible bakery attached and amazing renovated rooms for guests to stay.'

Maybe it s the abundance of blooms or the complete air of romance, but it seems the most perfect place to marry and the proof is at our fingertips. Sunshine Daydream Events coordinated the day, Lilypots designed the florals, and Lexia Frank snapped every detail you don t want to miss.'
p3386
aS'The Vision:\nArtists themselves, Doug and Leia wanted to tie in their love of art history throughout the wedding. Using Gustav Klimpt s  The Kiss  as inspiration, they had Illustration artist Joanna Bush design a personalized  Kiss  Illustration. The custom artwork hung in the reception, was used in the invitation suite, as well as the cake.'
p3387
aS'Wedding Dress:\nLeia found the perfect Allure Bridals dress, but it lacked the whimsical cap sleeves she had envisioned. An extra yard of the scalloped lace was ordered, and was seamlessly added- giving that whimsical look Leia wanted.'
p3388
aS'Jewelry:\nDoug and Leia designed their engagement ring together and had it made in Wilmington North Carolina by local jeweler, Scott Rhodes. The ring is rose gold and has an Edwardian antique look even though it s brand new. One very old element however is the Old European Cut diamond. The opal tear drop are the same color as the Spring Azure butterfly that flutters about the farm.'
p3389
aS'Bouquets:\nLeia chose an unstructured bouquet featuring succulents, dusty pink roses, coral peonies, sweet babyrose, lavender, blue thistle, blue muscario, scilla, ivory and pink astilbe, white stock, and seasonal herbs/berries for added interest.'
p3390
aS'Custom Cocktails:\nDoug and Leia combined their last names for the  PratapaDink-ini . A delicious grapefruit/citrus and basil vodka martini.  The Yes Dear - One of Doug s bourbon concoctions with Sprechers Ginger Ale.'
p3391
aS'Live Entertainment:\nGuests drank signature drinks and danced in the evening sun to the musical talents of The Brothers Quinn- an incredible bluegrass/folk band that dress the part! They are normally a four piece bluegrass/folk band but for our wedding brought in two guest performers to play harmonica and guitar as well.'
p3392

p3393

Set at the clean, crisp Chicago History Museum, it s filled with rose gold touches, a cute-as-can-be popcorn bar, heavenly florals from A Splendid Occasion and so much more. Head to the gallery for every bit!'
p3440
aS'From Roots Of Life Photography  Joanna of Joanna B. Artistry & I are pleased to share our latest styled shoot featuring a luxurious palette of rose gold, pale blush, cream and gray. I would describe this inspiration shoot as sweet, classic & chic  a modern twist on the traditional (and trendy) wedding. In thinking about what key elements we wanted to focus on, Joanna & I decided we wanted the shoot to be practical & relate-able while introducing brides to new and emerging trends, colors and themes from the wedding industry.'
p3441
aS'The biggest new element & focal point is the rose gold or copper color you will see throughout the shoot. Brides are quickly becoming obsessed with it as the trend is fast emerging on social media. I have been seeing more and more rose gold rings lately, several women I know have even changed their wedding rings to rose gold! CA Jewelers gave us two sets of wedding ring & band options and I just had to show you pictures of both. Stunning!'
p3442
aS'Plate & Nimble Well did a fantastic job of using the rose gold color in designing the tables. The blush chargers, water goblets, sweets displays & hand painted silverware really tie everything together. Our  Chicago  Mule signature cocktail mugs are perfectly paired with the theme as well. Speaking of signature cocktails, CH Distillery & Goose Island pair nicely in our ginger drink.'
p3443
aS'Something fun we wanted to do was feature ONLY Chicago vendors, a celebration of the best our city has to offer. Chicagoans are very proud of their city and we wanted to show brides that they too can incorporate their own cities local businesses, trends, foods & products into their wedding design without it appearing to  themed. '
p3444
aS'Another element we wanted to tie in was comfort. Midwest brides are all about comfort, even the ones with large wedding budgets. That being said, we wanted to do something different and veer off from the food & favors that are currently on trend (I m looking at you French Macaroons!). Lovely, A Bake Shop made us delicious mini doughnuts & peanut butter fluff pies for our sweets table as well as provided us with small jars of their home-made jam as  favors . Their peach-lavender jam is to die for!'
p3445
aS'Instead of a trendy candy bar, we put together a popcorn bar featuring Chicago vendors. I am a popcorn addict myself and was thrilled with how well this came together. Oh Olive butter flavored olive oil & white truffle oil serve as a nice base for toppings. The  Spice House  spices feature a Chicago theme, place or element and taste DELICIOUS on popcorn. Both companies work with brides to create fun favors and elements for any wedding or event. Our paper products from Fox & Hound Paperie are so chic and fun. Don t you just love those custom popcorn bags?!'
p3446
aS'Tiffany of A Splendid Occasion (SMP Little Black Book member) nailed our vision and her floral pulled everything together in a cohesive way. The venue, Chicago History Museum, is the PERFECT place for a classic & timeless Chicago wedding. The Chicago Room is just breath taking.'

Splendid Supply Co., Studio Fleurette, Cocoa & Fig and Paper Rock Scissor worked their color inspiration magic, and the goodies from Paper Antler are sitting happily right here. '
p3494
aS'From Splendid Supply Co  In Minnesota, spring starts really late and doesn t last long, so we wanted to design an inspiration shoot that celebrates the season we so look forward to each year. We used a variety of floral motifs to create an underlying vision for the shoot, including fresh and paper flowers as well as floral patterns and graphics. We then layered in a palette inspired by the first pale blooms of spring paired with some poppy tones to give it a contemporary, less expected look.'
p3495
aS'The overall shoot style leans modern, with lots of bright white to keep it fresh and hints of gold for a celebratory feel. It was softened by vintage details throughout the design, including the Victorian silhouettes of the table legs and orange goblets, the milk glass vessels with soft, whimsical floral designs, the midcentury vintage tableware and flatware, and the two stunning blush Claire La Faye dresses our bride wore.\n'

S'Soft, warm and cozy: the first three words that come to mind when describing this breathtaking Chicago wedding.  A day that is rich in elegant details with just a touch of winter whimsy to bring it all together. Think crazy cool centerpieces from Fleur, the planning expertise of Five Grain Events, fab paper goods from Ruby the Fox and a world of lovely images captured by Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema.  See them all in the full gallery.'
p3532
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema  I am so excited to share Jessica and Jake s wedding today! Jessica and Jake have one of the largest, most fun, and most loving group of friends and family we have ever encountered. It was such an honor to feel the love and excitement that surrounded them on their wedding day. Five Grain Events did an amazing job making the day go smoothly, and the florals by Fleur were just exquisite. The bouquets and centerpieces included bits of cotton and gnarly wooden elements for texture and contrast. The combination of light and beautiful natural elements and industrial elements in the venue made for a visually stunning wedding day.'
p3533
aS'Ravenswood Event Center is a unique venue in Chicago, with three floors and an event room that includes a collection of vintage cars and neon signs. The bridal party started the day getting ready at Public Hotel, a bright and airy boutique hotel. This winter day was especially cold, so we made our way directly to Ravenswood after Jessica and Jake had their first look at Public. After a few photos at Ravenswood, the festivities officially began with a traditional Tish and Bedeken. Guests moved to the second floor for the ceremony, and finally to the first floor for dinner and dancing.'

S'With a modern Cinderella-esque feel, this glamorous, yet elegant soiree from Liz Banfield and Rocket Science Weddings & Events will leave you feeling sparkly, to say the least. From a bow-adorned pair of Valentino s matched perfectly to the Bride s stunning Vera Wang dress, to the glittered cake pops from Cocoa & Fig and everything in between, this gallery has black-tie bash written all over it.'
p3602
aS'From Liz Banfield and Rocket Science Weddings & Events According to Amy and Maury, there are never enough reasons to get dressed up so going with black tie for their wedding was a natural choice. Working with their event designer, Gretchen Culver, they settled on the theme of  Modern Glamour,  inspired by the timeless style of the 1950s but with new twists on classic traditions. This theme fit perfectly with the venue, the historic Minneapolis Club. Both the ceremony and reception would take place here so that guests to move throughout the spaces with ease.'
p3603
aS'The bride loves Cinderella, so hints of the fairytale showed up throughout the event from the Save the Date card that was designed to look like the Cinderella movie credits to the beverage napkins that read  happily ever after.  And although Amy didn t wear glass slippers, her knockout Valentino shoes seemed fit for a princess. Amy also got to wear her dream gown, the Vera Wang Luxe  Esther  from L Atelier Couture Bridal which was accessorized by a train-length black velvet sash. Velvet accents were used throughout the wedding design, including the wedding invitation that was enclosed in a velvet black  tie. '
p3604
aS'Inspired by vintage photos of Frank Sinatra, the groom and his groomsmen donned single carnations for boutonnieres. Also to keep his wedding party occupied while waiting for pictures to begin, he had custom playing cards made and set out poker chips along with classic games like backgammon and chess for some old-school entertainment. Later in the reception, these games were also put out for the guests to play.'
p3605
aS'Instead of a traditional monogram, a unifying theme throughout the design was a custom pattern created by the Gretchen Berry Design that was inspired by the iconic carpet pattern in the Minneapolis Club s dining room. The graphic pattern was repeated throughout the printed materials.'
p3606
aS'In a modern twist on the old school  champagne fountain,  glasses of champagne were incorporated into a oversized ice sculpture designed especially to hold modern stemless flutes. This sculpture served as the centerpiece to a pre and post ceremony cocktail hours for guests. And later, these same glasses were washed, filled with candy, and given as a parting gifts.'
p3607
aS'In keeping with Jewish tradition, the ceremony was timed for after sunset on Saturday. Cool blue tones from the dusky sky outside lit up the oversized leaded glass windows, a beautiful counterpoint to magical candlelit ceremony. The room s columns were accented with floral garlands, twisting floor to ceiling. With the stage thus set, the bride and her parents emerged from the doors under a canopy of dangling votives and lace installation to evoke  fairy godmother dust  created by Rocket Science Weddings and Events. They arrived at a modern lace chuppa in which each corner of a small stage was anchored with oversize hurricane lanterns that housed gold candelabras. Wishing to be surrounded by their friends and family, the couple chose to have seating along three sides of the chuppa rather than rows of seats behind them.'
p3608
aS'After cocktail hour, guests were led to the upstairs dining room and greeted by individual  his-and-hers  cake-pop escort cards. Two flavors, hers with a pink and his with an ivory frosting, were sprinkled with edible gold glitter.'
p3609
aS'Upon entering dinner, the mostly ivory and pink color scheme was transformed to ivory and yellow. This floral transformation complemented the moss green linens and iconic carpet in the dining room, creating a very formal yet fresh feel for dinner.'
p3610
aS'The couple cut into a four-tier wedding cake iced with ivory buttercream in the club library. The nostalgic confection was adorned with roses and two porcelain cats, representing the couple s beloved pets.'
p3611
aS'After a spirited Hora dance, guests mingled, danced, played games and took turns at a photo booth. Mid-reception they were offered an array of late night snacks including 50 s-style malts (complete with authentic white and red straws), sliders and petite grilled cheese sandwiches to keep the dancing going well into the night.\n'

S'Classic and Chicago weddings just go hand in hand. That city just knows how to host a timeless f te. Case and point? This beauty of a wedding captured by Jeffrey And Julia Woods at the Chicago Cultural Center. Complete with florals from Heffernan Morgan Designs and a reception that will make you swoon, this gallery will have you thanking your lucky stars that Chicago weddings are so chic.'
p3660
aS'Tim and I met in college over the summer when we were both counselors at a camp in northern Michigan. It was a classic case of summer lovin  that never ended. We both ended up moving to Chicago within a year of each other and dated ever since. Our friends would describe us as fun-loving and laid-back, and we wanted our wedding to reflect our personalities.'
p3661
aS'Our first plan was to have everyone celebrate at the camp where we met, but the property is not set-up for weddings. On to Plan B; Chicago!, which in the end was actually Plan A and a lot easier for all our guests. We love our city and wanted to share the best of the best with our guests. I m an event planner professionally, so I am constantly challenged to create unforgettable experiences and knew this was a big one for me. There was really only one venue that we considered   the Chicago Cultural Center (formerly the public library). A destination in itself for tourists, we knew this was a knock-your-socks-off reception setting for our visiting guests.'
p3662
aS'I d always pictured a beautiful outdoor ceremony surrounded by greenery   hard to come by in downtown Chicago. We got creative and decided on the Tiffany Garden in Grant Park. The grand Buckingham Fountain and the Chicago skyline was our backdrop and having the ceremony  in the round  created an intimate environment and prevented us from being a spectacle on a busy day in the park. French country chairs and a wrought iron chuppah with intertwined vines and white flowers looked at home in the garden space.'
p3663
aS'The bridesmaids wore shades of blush and were contrasted by groomsmen in black tuxedos and black Nikes   the groom s shoe of choice. The floral incorporated trailing greenery, blush peonies and black and white anemones.'
p3664
aS'The party made its way over to the Cultural Center and we felt like we were in a different time entering the main hall. The room carries a lot of weight on its own, so we simply wanted to accent it. Sound Investment lighting designers brought in amber uplights, which set off the blue Tiffany dome, and organic leafy light patterns that enhanced the dance floor. Tables were set with gold lamour linen, vintage silverware, crystal etched glasses and other delicate curios. Eucalyptus garland runners intermixed with vintage silver candelabras and ornate pewter bowls overflowing with romantic tangled flowers and fruit.'
p3665
aS'With just 2 hours to turn the room from a public concert (that ended at 5pm), our vendors kicked a** and transformed the space beautifully. Everyone knocked it out of the park, Botanicals nailed the tablescape and Entertaining Company stole the show with an unbelievable menu. Amazing friends of mine, who are designers, helped create super custom invitations and paper suite, which added to the fun. In the end, I wouldn t have changed a thing!\n'

It s the masterful stylings + florals of Modern Day Floral And Events joining forces with crazy cool La Tavola linens, fab paper goods from William Arthur and one crazy gorgeous moment after another captured by Kai Heeringa Photography.  Lose your breath in the full gallery.'
p3801
aS'And a sweeter than sweet look at the day from Coastline Studios  You re welcome. '
p3802
aS'From Modern Day Floral and Events  When I first met Katherine and Patrick, they simply had a fleeting vision and palpable excitement for their wedding day. What ensued was months upon months of collaborative brain-storming, selecting perfectly-hued blooms, drooling over textured linens, and meticulously arranging floor plans. Katherine, her mother and I spent over 15 months together planning this special day. Our business relationship quickly grew into a warm friendship, which I will forever cherish.'
p3803
aS'Katherine and Patrick s color palette featured soft peach and blush pink, creamy ivories, and lush greenery. We wanted the floral arrangements to have that loose and vintage romance aesthetic. The floral pieces featured fluffy white hydrangea, peach Juliet garden roses, lush ivory and blush peony, ranunculus, local flowering dogwood branches, and playful anemone. Clusters of blush pink hobnail glass, silver mercury glass, and pottery pieces were put together to create an eclectic, yet elegantly styled look to each table.'
p3804
aS'The most important design aspects for this wedding were the little, but impactful and adorable details. French baguettes with hand calligraphed place cards tied in twine at each place setting. Custom display flags for all of the gourmet cheeses and desserts. Frames with calligraphed menu details at each food station. Bride and groom s chair signage adorned with draping greenery and lush blooms. A vintage globe for guests to sign, rather than the traditional book. A local Lebanese pastries and sweets station to reflect the bride s heritage. Multi-layered and textured draping ribbons on the bride s bouquet handle. A coral flip flop station for guests to get comfortable and dance in  The details were endless and the effect clearly showed. It really is all about making the guest experience truly remarkable!'
p3805
aS'As a professional, there comes a time in this industry when you find a client that you wish all your clients were like. Katherine and Patrick never lost sight of what was really important   their upcoming marriage, and making their guests  experience absolutely outstanding. This wedding not only brought us lifelong clients, but also lifelong friends   what a bonus! I can t wait to watch this couple grow in their marriage, and I hope to be a part of their life for many more years and events to come!'
p3806
aS'From the Bride  To say our wedding day was pure magic is a complete understatement. Patrick and I are eternally grateful for all of the vendors that truly made our day the most spectacular day of our lives to date. While designing the look and feel of our wedding, our number one goal was to create a night that reflected not only the love that surrounded us, but also accurately expressed our love and appreciation for everyone who was there. We tried to think of each detail of the wedding from the perspective of our guests. We knew we would have the time of our lives, but we also wanted our guests to have the time of their lives.'
p3807
aS'It was also really important to us to include as many personal touches as possible. Patrick wore my late father s cuff links, and I wore a diamond and sapphire bracelet that was given to my great grandmother by my great grandfather on their wedding day 85 years earlier. Jenn from Modern Day Floral and I connected right away   especially with our love of the little details, and she and her team immediately set to work on working out every detail of the day and evening.'
p3808
aS'Picking the venue was a bit challenging as I was really set on having the reception outdoors. The outdoor feel more accurately reflected our vision than any of the indoor venues in Grand Rapids. We decided on a venue that came full circle for us   we met at Blythefield Country Club four years earlier and thought it would be the perfect place for our reception as well. Blythefield has a beautiful outdoor grove and we could just imagine it as the perfect backdrop for our tented wedding reception.'
p3809
aS'The ceremony was held at the oldest church in Grand Rapids   St. Mark s Episcopal Church. It was also the same church my grandma and grandpa were married in 58 years earlier. As soon as the ceremony ended, guests arrived at Blythefield and entered the most exquisite fabric draped tent with sparkling chandeliers. At each place setting was an individual baguette that served as a place card. I am in love with all types of paper products and lettering, and I was so excited that Molly Jacques was able to create so many beautiful pieces for our day.'
p3810
aS'In keeping with our overall goal of showing our love and appreciation for our guests, we wanted them to enjoy several different types of food instead of one plated meal. We had a carving station, a risotto station, and a Lebanese station which is a nod to my heritage. For dessert, guests enjoyed vanilla peach champagne wedding cake and an assortment of desserts that included chocolate eclaires (Patrick s favorite), mini cherry and pecan pies, and orange madeleines (my favorite).'
p3811
aS'We danced the night away to an eleven-piece band and enjoyed mini grilled cheese, fries, and root beer floats as the night came to a close. Patrick and I loved planning out each detail with Jenn and look back at our wedding with pure awe and happiness. Our love for each other and the love that surrounded us that day were perfectly captured through our beyond talented photographers and cinematographers. Patrick and I are so blessed and look forward to what our future holds together!'

aS'From the Bride  I imagined a romantic, fairytale day for the wedding. I believe I got my fairytale ending, along with much, much more. I could not imagine a better day surrounded by the people I love most. Friends and family were everywhere I looked, from the moment I woke up (and my handsome groom had his best man deliver me Starbucks in bed) to the moment I rode off in a horse and carriage, waving to my parents amidst the crowd. The bridesmaids were dressed in blush to add a soft, romantic touch. The flowers had an English garden feel to them, with the soft romanticism of roses and light colors tightly bound in circular plumes on top of each table. The room was simply magical with the high ceilings, lit crests, and wooden beams. It felt like a royal wedding with a Harry Potter twist to it. I felt like the centerpiece with my princess, A-line gown swirling about me all night while I danced to live music, cut the simply elegant, towering cake, and made toasts to love, friendship, and family. The day went by without a hitch in the plans, and the night finished with a memorable exit.  The special details include: My mothers  sleeve from her wedding gown and my grandmother s brooch both attached to my bouquet, and the end of the evening topping off the night with Don and I riding off into the distance in a horse and carriage.'

S'With a stunning Bride, a dashing groom, and one seriously gorgeous wedding planned to perfection by One Fine Day Events, it goes without saying that this gallery is just beyond. Captured beautifully by Shane Welch Photography every picture perfect moment of this couples  beautiful Chicago day is waiting for you right here. And on top of it all, Loudbyte Cinematography made sure we could see it all play out on film. And trust me, you don t want to miss it.'
p3912
aS'I would describe our wedding style as modern traditional. While we didn t have a  head table , a bridal party entrance, or bouquet toss, and sent electronic save the dates, we still wanted to have our ceremony at a catholic church.'
p3913
aS'The ceremony took place at St. James Chapel, part of Holy Name Cathedral. It s a 90 year old chapel in the middle of Rush Street and is rich with history, and more noticeably its beauty! Our  grand exit  was complete with ribbon bells to preserve the grounds (ribbon bells from esty-LilyAmongThornsBride).'
p3914
aS'Post ceremony, the city theme was carried through our photo session. Our photographer, Shane Welch, with Shane Welch photography, knew we wanted a unique place that would allow for city views and chose a more remote beach suiting our style located at 31st street. It was rustic, chic, and had perfect views of the skyline and lake. It was very windy that day but it wouldn t have been a true Chicago wedding without it!'
p3915
aS'We never thought we would have held our reception at a hotel, but when we saw the ballroom at the Wyndam Grand Chicago Riverfront hotel (formerly Hotel 71), we knew we had to have our reception there. The primary reason we chose this venue was for the panoramic 39th floor views overlooking Chicago landmarks such as, the Wrigley Building, John Hancock tower, and the Museum of Science and industry, to name a few. As an added bonus, the venue had some character; it was Bruce Wayne s penthouse in the film The Dark Knight. The capacity of 130 guests made it the right size venue for us. We leveraged the beautiful city backdrop as our wedding  d cor  and enhanced it with floating candles and minimalistic floral designs from Stemline Creative.'
p3916
aS'A lot of credit for the day of details goes to many talented Etsy designers; Candycrush events for the sequin table cloths, Tangedesign, for the white sequin bride and groom Chivari chair covers, SimpleandStunning2 for the unique wedding programs, and Birdhouse stationary which designed the  city  vision I had for my wedding invites, which of course captured the city skyline. I was able to print and assemble at home to reduce the costs.'
p3917
aS'I also put my own creative touches on the wedding. Little details such as, designing and printing the place-cards and personalized water bottle labels (which I proudly taped to each water bottle), as well as, a Fuji film photo guest book station. Alliance Bakery also merged 3 cake design ideas I had in mind for a simple but modern cake which ended up tasting just as good as it looked! A lot of time was spent on some of the little details and the day of coordinators from One Fine Day events executed them better than I could have myself!'
p3918
aS'Additionally, I was also a beta tester for Appycouple, a wedding website and phone app that allowed us to e-mail our save the dates and have our guests rsvp online which saved us both time and money. Some guests were a little slow to catch on, but it was useful for us to track the responses and number of invites sent. The app also included all of the wedding details including integrated maps & directions for convenience.'

aS'All and all, it was one spectacular day and I can honestly say if I had the chance to do it again, I wouldn t change a thing about my wedding! 5 months after the wedding I got to virtually re-live it all over again with a beautiful film that Loudbyte Cinematography put together for me. It was truly a day we will cherish forever and I m so happy I have beautiful film and photos to remember it by!\n'

S'You can t deny it: this wedding is seriously stunning.  It s the epitome of ballroom elegance with some of the prettiest details you will ever see.  But beyond all of the amazingness (and it IS amazing) is a story of two middle school sweethearts who went from  going out  to tying the knot in the wedding of their dreams.  See every gorgeous moment captured by Coastline-Studios by pressing play.'
p3963
aS'From Coastline-Studios  Tanya and Paul had one of the most stunning weddings we ve ever seen with sequin, textured tablecloths, crystals and linens draped from the ceiling, candlelight, chandeliers, and some the most lush, white and blush flowers on every table  I have to say the girls on our team all got weak at the knees, it was just so beautiful. With help from Beautiful Day Planning, Tanya and Paul had the wedding they had been waiting over 12 years to celebrate (together since middle school, how adorable is that?).'
p3964
aS'From the Bride  Well, we have been together for a solid 12 years, and have never broken up! We are high school sweethearts and even date back to middle school.  Paulie was a grade older and had told one of our mutual friends he thought my twin sister and I were cute, and wanted to be introduced to me.  We  went out  for a few years on and off in middle school until I got into high school and then we decided to make it  official  and the rest is history.  We went to middle school, high school, away to Western together, he moved to Cincinnati for two years and we did the whole long distance thing.  As the saying goes  Distance makes the heart grow fonder!  I always new Paulie was the one  it sounds so cliche, but it s true! I knew that some way, some how, when the time was right, we were going to make it work and go for the long hall.  12 years later, we are married!'

S'If you haven t noticed, we are big fans of Chicago weddings around these parts. I would go as far as to say we are super fans. And it s because Chicago brides just seem to put their own stamp on chic. Case and point   this beauty planned by Soir e Weddings & Events with florals by Exquisite Designs. Every image from Studio Starling shows a couple that isn t just stylish but super in love, making us super in love with this gallery.'
p4071
aS'Proposal This past February, in what had been a crazy year of weather in New York following Hurricane Sandy, the city was once again bracing for a big storm, Nemo. It s pretty miserable getting around the city when a big snow storm hits and near impossible to get a cab but Scott was insistent that we venture out and head to our favorite pizza restaurant at the end of our block for our usualFriday night  date night.  We visited there almost weekly, so I didn t quite understand the urgency to make it there in the midst of a record setting blizzard but alas I agreed and off we went. Following dinner we walked back out into the blizzard conditions to head home and within feet of the restaurant Scott dropped to one knee and asked me to marry him. Of course I said yes! And we were even able to get my eventual Maid of Honor and her boyfriend to venture out in the snow for some celebratory drinks!'
p4072
aS'Wedding Prior to getting engaged we had decided on Chicago as the location as that s where I grew up and Scott s family lives just a short drive away in Madison, Wisconsin. Through family friends we were familiar with Gallery 1028 and after looking at a few other venues decided 1028 was it! We both loved the unique location of being on Goose Island and especially loved the unique aspects of the venue like the wood floor, exposed brick and huge windows. Since we were planning the wedding from half way across the country we decided that a Wedding Planner was a must. After doing some research we found Tiffany at Soir e Weddings & Events and she did a fantastic job bringing our vision to life. Our goal was to have a great day with family and friends and most importantly make sure everyone had fun and we couldn t have asked for anything more! What a truly special day it was!'
p4073
aS'From Studio Starling Photography Lisa chose bright blue for her bridesmaids to wear and the cutest floral robes for them to get ready in. Scott s love of design showed in his shoes and classic attire for the guys. Everyone got ready at the W Lakeshore and because it was a gorgeous summer day, we walked over to Olive Park for their first look and group photos. Then it was on to Michigan Avenue to have the couple photographed with a beautiful stretch of Chicago architecture. When we arrived at Gallery 1028, we found a space made beautiful by Soir e, flowers by Exquisite Designs, sweeties by Molly s Cupcakes and music filled the room by High Society Orchestra. It was a fun night full of dance, edibles, cocktails and lots of laughter!\n'

S'I ve been following Rhi of Hey Gorgeous Events ever since I landed in the wedding industry, but it s not without good reason. She s one of the best and brightest in the biz, and when Rhi sent us her latest wedding work of art   a pink and gold New Year s Eve celebration - I pored over every image from Jen and Jonah longer than I care to admit. Take a peek back at this sweet couple s engagement, and don t miss the gallery + Studio 213 Films  amazing video for a whole lot more.'
p4112
aS'Yet right before I sent up the signal to the bridal party to let them know the processional was about to start, we got some bad news. Katie had lost her engagement ring. As the string quartet played, the guests eagerly anticipated the bride s big reveal, and poor Bryan stood at the alter confused and wondering what was going on (sorry Bryan!), Katie and her girls were scrambling around trying to find her ring at what probably was the worst time to be doing so. I met her halfway up to the bridal suite to get things back on track and told her all that mattered in that moment was the kind groom waiting for her at the alter. And that we would find the ring no matter what. Her Dad held her hand, she shook her head, wiped away a few tears and together they trekked down the thirty plus stairs to the 250 awaiting guests. The ceremony began at long last and the show went on.'
p4113
aS'Immediately after I sent Katie off down the aisle, we got the news that the ring had been found; by a very gracious janitorial employee who had discovered the ring sitting in the corner of the venue restroom! From there the ring went from the hands of the employee to my husband, to a guest, to the videographer, to the photographer, to the best man, to the groom and finally back into the hands of our sweet bride. Katie was reunited with her most special piece of jewelry at the exact moment when it came time to exchange the rings. Bryan was a little confused as to we he was handed three rings instead of the two he was expecting but Katie burst into happy tears at the sight of thought to be long lost possession. There would continue to be many more moments of happy tears and sheer joy that day, all of which shined brighter than any diamond ring.'
p4114
aS'When it came close to midnight everyone stood on the dance floor and counted down to the start of 2014 via the large screen which was live streaming the Times Square coverage. At midnight a confetti canon erupted sprinkling colored bits over all of the happy guests embracing their loved ones as Auld Lang Syne began to softly play. It was beyond a pleasure being a small sliver of the Sapp s happily ever after, and an honor to work with such a talented team who made it all possible.\n'

S'Think of this gorgeous Chicago wedding as our Monday morning gift to you.  It s Old World romance meets traditional pretty in a breathtaking backdrop known as the Chicago Cultural Center and it s pretty much the perfect way to jump start a work week.  Think one seriously darling duo and a gallery of amazing captured by Gerber + Scarpelli Wedding Photography.  See it all here. '
p4179
aS'From The Bride  Following the theme of our wedding an old world love story our first quest was to find the perfect venue. Although we both grew up on farms in rural northwest Illinois, Chicago has always been romantic to us as the place where we first began our lives together and purchased our first home. When we entered the Chicago Cultural Center s Preston Bradley Hall, it took our breath away with its giant glass dome (the largest Tiffany dome in the world), multicolored mosaics, sprawling marble, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Millennium Park. It had the iconic Chicago landmark feel we sought as almost all of our wedding guests would be traveling into the city for our wedding, and the icing on the cake was its history. It was the original Chicago Public Library. We truly would be married in the place that housed all of the great love stories.'
p4180
aS'A huge thank you goes to Maggie Thalheimer of Gerber + Scarpelli Photography. She captured the  old world Chicago  feel in our engagement pictures with classic black and white pictures of us and the skyline that we incorporated into our save the dates, our wedsite shaped as a book, and day of. We had a blast with her and Tim Jaroz throughout the wedding.'
p4181
aS'Fashion was my next priority. I wanted a dress that combined the soft, romantic feel for the day and that was grand enough for the ballroom enter Vera Wang s Hayley. Matching the organza petals on my dress, the bridesmaids and groomsmaids wore black organza one-strap sweetheart floor-length Lazaro Noir dresses. My maid of honor wore a similar black organza strapless Lazaro Noir gown with a sash. The groom and groomsmen sported BLACK by Vera Wang tuxes in classic black and white.'
p4182
aS'We next focused on selecting a florist to enhance our venue and bring our romantic vision to life. For our June wedding, I envisioned soft ivories, golds, and blush pink with petals, petals, and more petals to match my dress. Specifically, I was smitten with pink peonies and also wanted to incorporate white hydrangea and white roses, which was the first flower my husband had ever given me. Anthony Gowder Designs, with special thanks to Suzanne Read, nailed it perfectly. I almost cried when they delivered my bouquet it was such a beautiful combination of the three flowers, and she even left a spot on the stem to attach my grandmother s brooch after learning she had passed away earlier in the week so I could keep a piece of her with me throughout the day. The groom s boutonniere featured the white roses and a sprig of hydrangea to set his apart from the rest. The bridesmaids carried pink peonies and the groomsmen wore white roses wrapped in black silk. Our aisle featured uplit columns lined the aisle alternating elevated floral arrangements and candelabras, and our monogrammed aisle runner was lined with blush pink rose petals up to the altar. Vintage book page petal cones were provided to guests for the petal toss. The true showpiece of the day was our cake table. A waterfall of flowers descended the cake and culminated at the bottom of our elevated glass cake table.'
p4183
aS'We prepped for the day in our suite at the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile, which was more than accommodating.'
p4184
aS'Our hometown pastor, John Sgro, officiated the ceremony. I walked in to the Sound of Music wedding processional, and we walked out to  Everything  by Michael Buble for our recessional. Our mutual friend who originally set us up on a blind date eight years ago provided the readings, including  I Do  by Carrie Bradshaw. Our fathers provided the  Blessing of the Hands  before we exchanged rings, which brought us both to tears. Despite the 300 other people in the room, it truly seemed as though it was just us a moment in time that we will always treasure.'
p4185
aS'Debra Nauman of Simply Elegant Catering, made sure no guest left hungry. Our cocktail hour was a bustle of passed hors d oeuvres, including our favorite tomato basil soup shooters with triangle grilled cheese sandwiches. One of our highlights of the day was when she pulled my husband and I aside after the ceremony into a private room to give us a chance to have our first glass of champagne and savor the appetizers. We re so grateful she did because we didn t have a moment available after that! Simply Elegant also featured a delicious pink lemonade martini signature drink with a sugar rim and lemon peel, which we named the Mr. & Mrs. Sturtevant-tini. We honed in on offering a  taste of Chicago  to our guests, providing Goose Island 312 beer from the bar and a local favorites late-night snack of Chicago-style hot dogs, sliders, and French fries.'
p4186
aS'Cake Chicago provided our delicious five-tier cake with two flavor options: White buttermilk cake with raspberry and lemon cream filling frosted with Italian buttercream and chocolate fudge cake with salted caramel and creme brulee filling frosted with Italian buttercream. Simply Elegant then provided an ice cream sundae bar to serve with the cake.'
p4187
aS'Our paper goods by Holly at Pink {Paper + Ink} helped make the  love story  theme come to life. We named the tables after books and movies that were meaningful to us as couple, and incorporated our favorite love quotes on the place cards and table numbers. Holly even made  And they lived happily ever after  signs for some fun group shots.'
p4188
aS'Loudbyte Cinematography captured our day on film. They gave our reception a fun twist after our bridal party was announced, the DJ asked all of the guests to gather for a special presentation during which our love story short film premiered. It shared how we met and our future plans. At the conclusion, he then welcomed us into the ballroom for the grand introduction. We felt so much love from everyone walking into that room!'
p4189
aS'Our DJ, Tom from Spinnin  Discs, was such a joy to work with and kept the dance floor packed all night long.'
p4190
aS'We capped off the night with a private last dance to  The Way You Look Tonight  while our guests prepared for the  let love shine  midnight sendoff on the steps. As we ran out, I will never forget the look on my groom s face as he saw my surprise wedding gift to him a vintage getaway car. We spent the next hour cruising up and down Lakeshore Drive with the windows down, sipping champagne, listening to country music, and trying to soak in every moment and memory.'

aS'I wanted classic and romantic with a touch of rustic. I wanted to show you my style and my thoughts and inspiration. I love a barn wedding with burlap and mason jars, but it was important to me to show something different to all of you. I think simplicity is lost at a wedding, I wanted to show that simple and classic is gorgeous and effortless beauty wins.'

S'Give me a classic soiree doused in blush pink and you ll have one happy wedding blogger on your hands. Said wedding? This candlelit beauty from Heather Cook Elliott. With so many family legacies layered in, including the Bride sewing pieces of family members  wedding dresses into her own and wearing her Groom s Grandmother s Tiffany earrings, this gallery is overflowing with traditional elegance at it s best.'
p4276
aS'From Heather Cook Elliott  Oh where to start. As I look back on Katelyn and John s wedding day I am flooded with adjectives   elegant, romantic, classic, traditional, sweet, lovely   and yet none of them seems quite enough. Their wedding day was the complete, real deal package, the kind of wedding day that manages to be perfectly beautiful but feels easy, wonderfully traditional but still fun. It starts with Lake Forest, a little seemingly magical place 30 miles north of Chicago where small town luxuries include great beaches, boutique shopping and an elegant family oriented Club called Onwentsia. With majestic willows on its golf course and century old brick architecture to boast of, Onwentsia is the place where John s parents celebrated their wedding and where John played as a kid. Its close to his family home and close to his heart, and now its close to Katelyn s too.'
p4277
aS'So many family details were incorporated into the day it was easy to see that though it all came together as uber-stylish and very  pinnable , their day was honestly about celebrating their family legacies. John wore his grandfather s tux studs, Katie his grandmother s Tiffany earrings; Katie sewed fabric from family wedding dresses embroidered with wedding dates into her own dress and she wore a now-heirloom veil that other women in her family have worn. They said I Do at John s family church and celebrated at Onwentsia, riding to and fro in a 1941 Ford Super Deluxe Sedan restored by Katie s late Grandpa Robert as a replica of his first car. Katie s dad hauled the burgundy stunner from her hometown in Indiana and all the men in her family decorated  Old Bob  on the day of the wedding, a stunning tribute to tradition and family that I adored. The pictures say more than my words can ever hope to, so without further ado, enjoy a peek into Katelyn s & John s stunningly beautiful wedding day.\n'

S'They say that true love conquers all, and in the case of this adorable duo, it couldn t be more true. Because a day that started off with a trip to the emergency room and a missed dinner celebration with friends and family ended with some of the sweetest  I do s  you will ever lay your eyes upon.  Think glowing candlelight and smiles that are never-ending.  Just how a wedding should be.  See it all captured by Two Birds Photography right here.'
p4356
aS'From The Bride  Jerome and I were married on January 10, 2014 in Chicago, IL. We approached our wedding not just as a chance to celebrate our love for each other, but to celebrate the love we have for our family and friends. We kept it small so that we could individually focus on each guest and the extra effort made the day more intimate. For instance, my younger brother wrote and performed an original poem, and instead of a seating card we hand wrote a letter for each guest sharing what we appreciate about them and how they shaped our lives both individually and as a couple. We also asked each guest to take Polaroid photos of themselves so that we could have photos of our closest friends and family decorating the walls of our new home. We served our favorite foods (like braised short ribs and smoked salmon) with choice of dessert (New York style cheesecake or French Apple Pie with homemade ice cream) thanks to the Boarding House and Julia, their fabulous in-house pastry chef.'
p4357
aS'We looked to vintage inspiration to create a beautiful space for everyone to enjoy and so many great vendors helped make our day possible. Fragrant Design created delicate succulent and baby s breath arrangements, and Kel and Co handmade a custom altar out of vintage lace and did an outstanding job coordinating our day-of events. I wore a vintage-inspired gown from BHLDN with a custom-made veil, and much of our d cor, such as brass candlesticks and mercury glass planters, was vintage thrifted.'
p4358
aS'Our wedding was beautiful and perfect in its own way, but that is not to say that everything went as planned. Jerome woke up very sick on the morning of our wedding, and at one point we considered getting married in the Emergency Room. When it came time for the ceremony, we decided to have all our friends and family enjoy dinner and time together without us while Jerome gathered his strength and I helped him to get ready back at The Langham. At the tail end of dinner, we finally arrived at our own wedding! We walked in and I don t think there was a dry eye in the house and everyone was cheering for us! We finally made it! For me (Julie), this was the best part of the day, to see everyone celebrating us and to walk down the aisle with my best friend knowing that he sacrificed so much and loved me to the point that he would not even let physical illness stop him from marrying me. For Jerome, the best moment of his day was after the ceremony.  I was still so nervous that I was going to be sick during the vows that I didn t relax until they pronounced us as husband and wife. When they did, and we turned around and cheered, I was so excited to be married to my best friend! That moment was unforgettable! '
p4359
aS'With all the planning that went in to our special day, it would be devastating to not remember or appreciate it, and this is why we are incredibly grateful to Jake and Jennifer from Two Birds Photography. Two Birds captured our day beautifully, and not in staged photos, but in the details: candid shots, sentimental moments shared and dozens of the small touches that helped to make our wedding so special. That exact moment that Jerome described, when we turned around and were pronounced for the first time, fists in the air, beaming, was captured on film perfectly so we have that moment forever. When I look at the images, I am not just reminded of what our wedding looked like; I am reminded of how I felt and who I was on that day. It takes a remarkably talented photographer to capture a feeling, but that is exactly what they did. With all that transpired on January 10th, we never could have appreciated it all, but thankfully Two Birds captured it for us and can appreciate it for years to come.'

aS'My parents first learned of Josh during my stepfather s birthday dinner in 2011  just weeks after Josh and I met! Josh knew they were in town for a weekend visit and knew that I was taking them out for a birthday dinner so he called the restaurant and had a bottle of champagne sent to our table as we sat down. Little did I know I d be forced into disclosing this  relationship  to my parents so soon after it had begun at this point Josh and I had only been out a handful of times! Needless to say, my parents were totally on board  so long as Josh promised to continue sending bottles of champagne!'
p4399
aS'Our choice for venue was primarily driven by the warm and intimate setting provided by the Waldorf s banquet room where the ceremony and reception were to be held. Both of us immediately knew this was the place and we booked on the spot. Although the hotel is not small, per se, it is able to maintain the boutique-ish feel which we both desired. Each and every employee truly made us feel as if the hotel was ours right from the start of the planning process.'

aS'Without a doubt, I think the most poignant description of the night was summed up by one of our guests who told us  the room was filled with love and that s something you cannot buy. \n'

S'Salvage One is a venue unlike any other. It beautifully combines charm and style, and the weddings there? Well they are always beyond   particularly when Olivia Leigh Photographie is behind the lens to capture the magic. Weddings like this one make us want to jump right out of our chairs, and you can see why here.'
p4441
aS'From the Bride Perhaps the most defining choice in planning our wedding was the date itself. I fell madly in love with a spectacularly nontraditional venue in Chicago   a place that is as quirky as it is elegant, as unexpected as it is inviting. The choice was easy, but the timing was complicated   due to availability, our only option was to have our wedding in January a month most other Chicago brides would never consider. But we knew our wedding wouldn t be us without this venue, so I let go of the fear of blizzards and freezing temperatures, and warmly embraced the idea of a cozy winter affair.'
p4442
aS'Planning this wedding was truly a gift   I wish every bride the opportunity to feel so cared for and to have so many cherished experiences leading up to her big day. My partner in crime for this journey was my mom   we had been dreaming about planning this day for 30 years. From collecting vintage handkerchiefs to roasting rosemary orange nuts for all of ours guests, she was as dedicated as I was to ensuring we covered every detail.'
p4443
aS'Our January day came with blue skies and plenty of sun. It had snowed two days earlier, which meant there was just enough powder on the ground to remind us how beautiful a winter wedding could be. And once the sun set and guests began arriving, it was clear   there was no more magical place to be married on this day than at Salvage One. Exposed brick walls, antique chandeliers and apple cider invited guests to settle in for the evening.'
p4444
aS'Looking back, I am incredibly proud of all our little touches   the things you wonder along the way if anyone will even notice. My mom collected vintage handkerchiefs and sewed on tiny tags that read  happy tears , which were given to guests before our ceremony. We set mismatched paper place mats at each place setting with silverware inside paper bags printed with the message,  It s time to drink bubbly and dance on the tables!  Origami cranes folded from handmade paper topped our cake as a tribute to my Japanese grandmother. Our favors were gourmet chocolate bars wrapped in childhood photos of me and my husband. The brainstorming, list making, shopping, printing, and packaging was all part of this incredible journey, and I could tell from the expressions on our guests  faces that we had successfully curated an event that inspired true joy.'

p4486
aS'From Ann & Kam Photography & Cinema  Paige and Ryan s wedding was one of the prettiest weddings we have ever seen in Chicago. Surrounded by her childhood friends, Paige prepared for the day that they had all been imagining since they were little girls. One by one, everything came together. Lace, sparkles, pale pink flowers   everything was perfect.'
p4487
aS'Ryan, of course, was cool as a cucumber as Paige arrived in Lincoln Park in a fabulous Lincoln Hotel pedicab to meet him. From that point on, the rest of the day passed in a whirlwind. Kam and I were pretty much in love with every square inch of A New Leaf   from the exposed brick to the magical courtyard, it quickly became one of our favorite places in the City. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by the amazing scents of A New Leaf s flower shop, and it s impossible not to be swept away by romance. We also have to mention the amazing caterers   Hearty Boys   who were so professional and thoughtful, they were simply a delight to work with!\n'

aS'From The Bride  Our theme was   Our Story .   It was inspired by the story of our love. It stemmed from a book that I had created for an anniversary gift for Nick. The book was in the form of a chapter book and it contained all of the messages that Nick and I wrote to each other via Facebook, mail and e-mail when we were dating long distance (Chicago to New Orleans). To incorporate this theme on our big day, I included this book along with the following: our love letters and envelopes, a mailbox for our gifts, cocktail napkins that included funny stories of our relationship and chapters for table numbers. We also searched through old photo albums and found a wedding portrait of each of our family members, as they are the beginning of our story. We had them all hanging by a string by our guestbook. This was a surprise and our guests loved seeing their very own picture celebrated on our day. My absolute favorite tie into our theme was Nick and my silhouettes on the menu cards. I believe that these little details made our ceremony unique.'
p4536
aS'As we were planning our wedding, Nick and I both found it important that our wedding day represented both of us as individuals as well as together as a couple. Nick knew how important it was to include all of the little details that described my personality. Confetti polka dots, chevron groomsmen socks, pink and orange color scheme, and way too many crafts was a perfect representation of me on our wedding day. Nick  s past history was included in a special New Orleans dance. The entire bridal party was given beads to pass out to the wedding guests. Nick and I were given big, heavy beads to wear and Mardi Gras masks. The second line song filled the room as we entered the dance floor. I twirled a white umbrella and the crowd picked up napkins to spin around in circles. Soon enough, everyone was on their feet participating in this New Orleans wedding tradition. We loved that everyone was so excited as they took part in this unique twist to our reception.'
p4537
aS'My favorite part of the day was walking down the aisle. Nick and I chose not to see each other before the ceremony so there was much anticipation for this moment. I remember standing in the bridal room at the church feeling a little nervous, but mostly excited. It was all a little fuzzy as they called us to line up. Soon enough, our bridal party had entered the church and it was just my dad and I. I begged him to tell me a joke, as both of us were having a hard time keeping it together. It was finally our cue and in that moment I felt the true meaning of marriage, forgetting all of the stress and crazy wedding plans we had been focused on within the past year. It was a crazy feeling walking down the aisle. I remember being surrounded by all of our family and friends in the church, but feeling like it was just Nick and I alone. I remember looking right into his eyes the entire way down. I can vaguely remember my dad holding my arm tightly and the faint sound of a violin playing Canon in D. I held back tears of happiness as I approached Nick. Hugging my dad was an overwhelming feeling, as he put Nick s and my hand together, giving us his blessing to begin our life together. As the ceremony went on I was able to sneak a peek at the packed church of people we loved so dearly. It was an overwhelming feeling to have them witness this special day in our life and I felt so grateful. I will always remember Nick  s smile as he saw me for the first time. In the end, it was worth every minute of waiting.'
p4538
aS'Nick and I met in confirmation class freshman year of high school, so it was important to us both that we were to be married within a church, as our faith is important to us. We picked St. Clement Catholic Church in Chicago, because it is the church we attend every Sunday. We also love the architecture and beauty of this breathtaking church.'
p4539
aS'I knew walking into the Woman s Club of Evanston that the venue was perfect for us. Nick and I knew all along that we wanted a different venue, one that was more unique. The Woman s Club had everything we were searching for and more. The beautiful chandeliers, the arched ceilings in the ballroom and the character of each room allowed me to envision us there on our wedding night. My sister told me as we left that she knew by the smile on my face that I had found the venue I had been searching for.'
p4540
aS'Stephanie Robinson was our florist for the event. I was referred by a friend to use Stephanie and could not have picked a better person to create the exact vision I had hoped to achieve. Stephanie works freelance so my experience was different than going into a flower shop and looking through a binder to pick the exact arrangements for the big day. Instead, Stephanie and I met over coffee and I explained to her how much I loved flowers, my way too many ideas from Pinterest, and a budget to stay within. As we talked, she helped me finally pinpoint my style and color scheme (any bride will contest how much harder of a decision this is than it truly seems) and gave me so many ideas of her own. It was cool because I felt an instant connection with Steph. I realized instantly that she was so similar to me; we shared the same style, personality and passion for flowers. I told her leaving Starbucks that day that I trusted her 100% and that she could run with my color scheme and surprise me. It was a weight off of my shoulders to allow her to be creative and it felt great to cross something off the never-ending wedding to do list. The moment she knocked on my room at The Drake Hotel was one of my favorite wedding day memories. I didn t know what my flowers were going to look like until the day they were in my arms and I had been waiting months to see what she had picked out for me. I had tears of happiness in my eyes when I saw the vibrant colors and unique styles. Not only did she create perfect bouquets but she also transformed my venue into a floral masterpiece. I could not have even envisioned more perfect flowers than what Stephanie picked and designed for our big day.'
p4541
aS'J&L Catering catered our event at The Woman s Club. We worked with Jim Bailey and he was absolutely phenomenal. He was not only responsible for creating a fabulous menu that worked within our budget but also served as our wedding planner during the entire planning process. It was such a wonderful feeling to know that I could email him at any time of the day or night and hear back from him within the hour with an answer to so many of my wedding questions. Our menu included a strawberry and almond poppyseed salad, chicken and salmon with a lemon cr me sauce and risotto paired with seasonal vegetables.'
p4542
aS'I can t even express in words how wonderful our experience was with Two Birds Photography. Jake and Jennifer are not only incredibly talented but such a joy to work with. Finding the perfect photographer was the first thing on my wedding to do list, as I believe that the photos are the only thing you will have forever. It was such a relief when my husband and I met Jake at a coffee shop because I knew within the first five minutes that he would be our perfect wedding photographer. Nick and I had a blast with Jake as he shot our engagement pictures. We felt so comfortable with him and were laughing the entire time. We were amazed at his artistic eye and how well he was able to truly capture our love. On our wedding day, Jake was there early to shoot pictures of the landscape of our hotel and the amazing architecture of Chicago. Our entire bridal party raved about how much fun and how professional Jake was on the trolley with us, as he was able to capture our trip from the city to Evanston. Our families and our wedding guests had nothing but amazing things to say about him as well. When we received our wedding slideshow, I couldn t help but cry with happiness. I felt like I was reliving the day all over again. I was so overjoyed at how well Jake was able to capture every emotion on our wedding day. Two Birds Photography was everything we could have asked for and way, way more.'
p4543
aS'We hired Zach Moss from Boom Entertainment as our DJ. Zach was amazing! He was able to mix three songs into one and kept the dance floor packed the entire night. I danced with family members I had never even seen dance before! I credit Zach for the amount of fun everyone had that night. Nick and I still love to look at all of the dancing photos to see everyone have the time of their life.'
p4544
aS'Nick and I consider ourselves foodies, so when it was time for our cake tasting we were really excited. We picked a bakery on the street we live on to try out first, thinking we would try out a few bakeries in Chicago. We had a wonderful experience working with Judy. She sat down with us and explained each flavor combination. The cake was amazing! She also hand sketched my perfect cake: gold chevron, polka dots and pink peonies. We picked a lemon and raspberry flavor for Nick s half and a double chocolate mousse for mine. It was perfect and we didn t even have to look anywhere else.'
p4545
aS'I found my dress at Volle s Bridal in Lake Zurich and it was designed by Pronovias. Dress shopping was really exciting at first, but after searching at seven bridal stores, I was beginning to feel frustrated. I had been told by many people that I would cry when I have found the perfect dress. I kept waiting for this to happen, and when it hadn t, I knew I didn t want to settle. I finally brought my dad with me to Volle s and when I put this particular dress on, he began to cry. At that moment, I knew it was perfect and tears streamed down my face too. I loved that the dress was vintage with a twist of modern style, a perfect mix of sassy and classy.'
p4546
aS'The biggest piece of advice as you plan your wedding is to remember that the day is about you and the love you and your fianc  share. Although it all can be very stressful at times, take time to go on dates and talk about things other than the wedding. Also, do as many DIY crafts in advance, if you plan to go this route. I was so pressed for time that I had my dad executing my last minute crafts in order to achieve the theme and style I was going for!'
p4547
aS'Make sure to take a moment to step back and admire everyone celebrating your big day. Nick and I snuck on stage for a few minutes and it was such an overwhelming feeling to see all of our favorite people having such a wonderful time celebrating us. We squeezed each other s hands as we felt so blessed to have everyone there on the most important day of our life.'

aS'From The Bride  Rob and I met at a party, not four weeks before I was scheduled to make a cross-country move from Illinois to Arizona. We wound up sitting in the kitchen and talking the whole night and then    despite my solemn vow *not* to start seeing anyone until I moved to Arizona   went on a date a week or so later. When it came time to move, I wound up making it halfway across the country before conceding that something was telling me to stay in Illinois a little while longer. So I turned around. And two years later, Rob proposed.'
p4695
aS'And then I got to work bringing all the pictures and ideas I had flagged for the past 27 years to life. Come on now. We (almost) all do it.'
p4696
aS'From the beginning, the goal was to have a wedding that was laid-back, eclectic, and full of DIY details  and also pretty, I m a fan of the pretty. We didn t want anything fancy or stuffy, as we are not fancy people (definitely not- quite literally the first thing I did after saying  I do  was spill bruchetta down the front of my dress! And my veil got stuck in a bush as I walked down the aisle! Seriously, not fancy people.) I love late summer, that final exhale of warmth, light, and color, and I wanted our wedding to be a snapshot of that- that final moment of sun and vibrancy before fall creeps in and color begins to fade away  this is partially why our wedding was during the last official weekend of summer. And while much of the day was overcast, the sun made a sleepy appearance for our ceremony  then made up for lost time and put on an amazing show with one of the most spectacular sunsets I have ever seen.'
p4697
aS'As for the personal touches and details   I scoured thrift stores across the country during various travels to find the items for out centerpieces   there are items from Illinois, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Arizona, and North Carolina. Both my husband and I love to travel, and thought having all these items from our travels would be a subtle (and also meaningful!) way to incorporate that into our big day. The french macaroons on our dessert table came from our favorite Bakery in Tempe, Arizona (of all places). The cookies were the recipes of my late grandmother,  The Cookie Lady.  The cookies and other baked goods were made by my bridesmaid Heather. I offered assistance here by cracking eggs and not dropping anything   I am a hopeless baker! Rob and I made all the invitations and wedding programs using paper from Paper Source, double-sided tape, and the greatest of all wedding purchases   a paper cutter. My father, an artist, painstakingly decorated the chalkboard easel welcoming guests to the day. I spent an inordinate amount of time creating over 30 paper dahlias, which were made of coffee filters, masking tape, straws, and ribbon. I enlisted the help of my aunt to create the ribbon backdrop to our ceremony. I used ribbon I bought in bulk, shredded pieces of gauzy curtains I bought at Goodwill, and old lace curtains we found in my Aunt s attic. I am truly, truly grateful for the help I received from family and friends.'
p4698
aS'After the memories of the centerpieces and music fade, we wanted our guests to remember the feel and vibe of the wedding. And we wanted them to feel comfortable and feel at home. We kept the guest list relatively small, so the wedding would still have an intimate, friendly feel. We had two lounge areas set up with vintage furniture (provided by Violet and Pearl Vintage Revival, and Heritage Prairie farms) and our favors were little jars of honey. Our menu was farm to table themed   corn on the cob, summer salad, roasted herbed chicken, chive smashed potatoes. We wanted dinner to feel like a family summer meal with a slightly fancified twist. This vision came to life beautifully by Heritage Prairie farms, with many ingredients coming from the farm itself. We closed the night with s mores around a campfire.'
p4699
aS'I know say many brides say this, and I m okay with being repetitive   it was truly the wedding of my dreams. Rob and I look back, and wouldn t change a single thing. All the hard work and elbow grease paid off- and the photo s by Krystal Muellenberg captures the day perfectly, and the pictures bring the whole day to life. It was the perfect day to start our lives together.'

S'Lovies, you re about to see a wedding 17 years in the making. It s a story that started in middle school study hall and blossomed into the most an epic celebration of lifelong love. Deisy Photography captured this afternoon soiree and there s much more to be found in the gallery.'
p4737
aS'From the Bride  Our wedding was a fairytale day 17 years in the making. Denny and I met in middle school study hall when we were both 12 years old. Since that time, we ve had years of friendship, shared passions, life experiences, happiness, sadness, and finally a deep and lasting love for each other that we celebrated on October 20th, 2013.'
p4738
aS'We are both graphic designers, and we try to approach life in fun and creative ways that are unique to us. We knew our wedding style would reflect this, and that we would want to both equally take part in the creation of our special day. It s a unique challenge to take on such a large creative project with your significant other Luckily the process taught us that we not only work seamlessly together but that our work enhances and is complimented by each other.'
p4739
aS'The budget was a big focus in the planning stages of our wedding. We are handy people by nature and whole heartedly subscribe to the DIY mentality. In the months leading up to the wedding, we purchased our first home which put even more emphasis on keeping ourselves within a reasonable budget. With our creative backgrounds we knew that we could bring our vision to life on a budget, but we also knew that we couldn t do it alone.'
p4740
aS'We reached out to friends and clients in our creative circle, and we were blown away by the inventive and artistic solutions that we received from them. We also drew on our own skills as graphic designers to create the invitations, programs, signage for the reception, and send-off flag favors for the guests. Being able to personalize our items in this way really set the stage for a wedding that was completely unique to our personalities.'
p4741
aS'The two venues that we chose for the day are special to us and fully represent our city of Norman, Oklahoma. The outdoor courtyard of the student union at the University of Oklahoma was the backdrop for our ceremony. Choosing this venue was easy as we went to school together at the university and graduated from the School of Art in 2006. I have lived in Norman my whole life and am a fourth generation graduate of the university so I knew it would mean a lot for my family to see us married there. Not to mention that the university has some of the prettiest architecture in town! Our reception venue was the historic train depot in the heart of the old downtown. It was the perfect, small scale setting for our intimate reception. Both venues reflected the  prairie deco  style that we were going for; a little bit of elegance on the Oklahoma plains.'
p4742
aS'Although I have deep Oklahoma roots, I am an Anglophile at heart, and it was important for me to incorporate some British elements into the styling and decor of the wedding. It was a challenge to mesh these two influences, but the results were perfectly  us . British-inspired elements included 500 feet of gold bunting flags, lovingly hand sewn by my amazing mother, the Oxford-like university setting for the ceremony, and a tea themed reception.'
p4743
aS'Our final artistic influence was the season of the wedding: fall. The answer to the question,  What color should this be?  was almost always gold or another color in the autumnal family. We purposefully avoided what I termed an  apples and hay  fall wedding as this was not our interpretation of the season. We wanted to focus on natural elements and colors, and to showcase the pleasant weather and beautiful, intense sunlight. We used minimal flowers in the ceremony and at the reception, opting for budget-friendly dried bouquets for the bridesmaids and golden potted mums for a splash of color on the ceremony stage. For my bouquet, I carried a sheaf of wheat which was a controversial choice but I loved it. Very inexpensive yet meaningful to me as it once again represented my heritage and the history of our state.'
p4744
aS'My wedding dress and accessories were almost all budget-friendly finds that I was able to repurpose and restyle to suit the look I was going for. My veil actually came from a vintage store and cost $27! It originally had a Juliet cap attached to it but I removed it and added a comb instead for a more modern look. I got lucky that the lace exactly matched the more modern dress I had already bought. I wore two dresses on the day, both of which I picked out and bought from a clearance rack! I got really lucky with these finds as neither dress needed alterations. Although I loved my wedding dress, I chose to get a second dress for the reception so that I could dance comfortably and be able to take off my 6  ceremony shoes! (Denny is 6 5 )'
p4745
aS'For the reception, we opted to have a proper high tea in the afternoon instead of a full meal. This meant sourcing and trying tea flavors and brands, and searching out a food vendor who knew what a proper scone was supposed to taste like! Not an easy task in the middle of Oklahoma. Luckily, we are blessed with a couple of talented and adventurous friends who own a local cafe and bakery. With barely any direction from us, the two of them and their two young pastry assistants created a spread worthy of a queen! Since we were having desserts and tea, we kept our wedding cake simple and small enough for just the two of us. We also made sure that two of every kind of dessert was kept back for us to sample later just in case we missed anything on the day.'
p4746
aS'We had about 100 guests at our wedding which was the perfect size for us. We were able to actually talk with everyone there and really enjoy the presence of far-flung friends and family. All too soon, however, the magical day was over and it was time to travel the short two blocks from the depot to our new home.'

aS'I cannot say enough how perfect and meaningful our wedding was to us. I think it s a great example of how it s possible to have a very beautiful and satisfying wedding on a small scale and budget. Staying true to our roots and interests was the key for creating the perfect wedding day that truly represented us. And having a good, creative circle of friends and enthusiastic help from our families didn t hurt either!\n'

S'Celebrating love is the greatest reason to celebrate in my book, and if you are going to kick up your heels, you might as well do so in style. Enter A Splendid Occasion and this ridiculously fun shoot captured by Emilia Jane Photography. This gallery is literally overflowing with fun, steal-worthy ideas for your next soiree (including some gorgeous beauty inspiration from Nika Vaughan Bridal Artists). Which means you should make a beeline to this gallery ASAP. '
p4780
aS'The goal was to keep everything very feminine, romantic, and soft, with a touch of whimsy. Alice Padrul s dresses (the highlight) really lend themselves well to this theme, and Emilia Jane photographed them beautifully. The bright, summer like colors and the accents of handmade materials really put this shoot over the edge. All of the materials used for this wedding can be created by anyone, it just takes a little bit of time! The handmade elements include the popcorn bar, calligraphy, the wedding cake, cake topper, as well as the backdrop for the ceremony, all by A Splendid Occasion.'

S'Two Birds Photography never fails to bring us the sweetest of soirees, and this pretty little party below is no different. It s honky tonk meets lovely garden party, and before looking at this gallery, I never knew that was one seriously darling combination. Well, it only takes one peek right here to see it so is. '
p4822
aS'From The Bride We couldn t have been happier with our 80-person wedding. Everything, including the venue, the music, the food, the photography, and the guests  even the weather  all came together better than we could have hoped. We aimed for a welcoming, fun, and friendly atmosphere for everyone, hoping for the sort of environment where no one would take themselves too seriously. We were very excited to host a Patsy Cline cover band and feature delicious BBQ food in a private urban courtyard. As a symbolic gesture, during our ceremony we planted a Japanese Maple tree that we brought home to plant in our own yard.'
p4823
aS'Wedding Dress - Luly Yang 2009, but I got it used from a charity called Brides Against Breast Cancer. I loved how BABC had hundreds of dresses from different designers at at different price points that I could try on at one time. It felt much more natural than the bridal boutique experience, and I was glad to support a good cause rather than buy a new dress that would never be reworn.'
p4824
aS'Venue - The secret garden where we hosted our wedding is the former courtyard and convent of St. Procopius Parish, founded in 1875. Today it is owned by Honky Tonk BBQ, a restaurant and music venue across the street. They handled all of the catering, and we had quite a feast (the bacon candy appetizer was a hit). The venue is BYOB, which allowed us to bring in a few kegs of local beer from Atlas Brewing, a new brewery owned by friends. Band -The Weepin  Willows, a phenomenal Patsy Cline cover band! Pastor - Reverend Rachel Frey, a friend and former co-op housemate of Lisa s. Photographer - Two Birds Photography. Jake was wonderful to work with, and we loved all of the wedding photos.'

S'Take everything you ve thought about a vineyard wedding and gently toss that out the window. Because this, my dears, is the vineyard wedding glammed up with chandeliers, macaroons, glitter tablecloths   the works. Munster Rose and Cocoa & Fig were a few vendors behind the pretty and Melissa Oholendt is to thank for the snaps. Sit back and start the swoon party here.'
p4875
aS'From Munster Rose  Mindy & Thomas knew they wanted a Midwest wedding and began searching for a venue that would not only provide a beautiful destination for their guests, but also an experience that would allow them to feel like they were enjoying an extended stay with their closest friends. They considered close to a dozen different places but fell in love with the natural yet refined elegance of Villa Bellezza, a vineyard in Pepin, Wisconsin on the beautiful, historic Highway 61.'
p4876
aS'Mindy and Thomas chose a lovely palate of blush, taupe, and soft golds to complement the high wood beams of the vaulted ceiling and curls of the wrought iron railings. When trying to decide what style they wanted, they knew they wanted sophisticated, but not contrived. They desired for the decor to match the natural feel of the vineyard, but also match their classic, and slightly eclectic taste. Beginning with the incredible iron and reclaimed wood arbor that Mindy s father handcrafted and ending with a decadent dessert table, every detail of their wedding was specifically chosen to be both aesthetically pleasing and a personal, thoughtful experience for their guests.'
p4877
aS'As guests entered the Villa for the ceremony, sun and a lush backdrop of the vineyard for the Ceremony greeted them. The to-be-weds were led down the aisle by their wedding party, their sweet dog Tucker, and their adorable nephew/ring bearer Kooper. Standing under the twelve-foot tall arbor that literally dripped with grapevines & lush floral decor and was crowned with a crystal chandelier, Mindy and Thomas promised each other their hearts forever. And in a meaningful touch, the stunning chandelier will hang in their newly built home to remind them of their vows and the beautiful start to their marriage.'
p4878
aS'After the ceremony, guests entered the Tuscan-style Winery where they found high vaulted ceilings and beautiful woodwork. A martini luge, carved to match the model of the plane Mindy and Thomas fly together in their careers as pilots, was waiting for guests as the entered the Tower room for an energetic Cocktail Hour. Fun was had by all the guests at the hand-built photo wall backdrop, that Mindy s dad also created, that allowed guests to take photos on their phones and upload the images to the wedding app, Wedding Party App, for the bride & groom to view while on their honeymoon.'
p4879
aS'For the aesthetic of the dinner & dancing portion of the night, Mindy & Thomas chose to incorporate vintage decor that they sourced themselves, such as an antique art easel for the escort cards as well as an assortment of the hand-picked family china for the head table. These pieces were mixed in with modern touches such as sequin linens and DIY shimmering table numbers to create a playful, yet elegant touch to the decor. Complementing the taupe satin linens at the guest tables were bright and loose floral designs that included giant dinner plate dahlias that Jackie, their florist, grew at her own home.'
p4880
aS'Soft touches of pink and gold throughout the space were also seen in their custom stationary, designed by Mindy s Maid of Honor and put together by Mindy, as well as their expansive dessert table where guests were encouraged to taste test a variety of sweets. The table featured miniature dessert shooters, macarons, mini tarts, and a light pink cake with gold fondant detailing, all displayed on a variety of gold and white cake stands, and surrounded by hand-crafted gold and glitter confetti. Guests dined on salmon and filets while they drank wine crafted at Villa Bellezza.'
p4881
aS'There were many special moments that they recall about the day, but their favorite moment included sneaking away for a few stolen minutes to the Bridal Suite to (literally) collapse on the floor and revel in all that had just taken place. With the ceremony behind them and a wonderfully long night of dancing and mingling ahead of them, they stole away to recount how they felt as they first saw each other that day from opposite ends of the aisle, to excitedly share their favorite parts of the day to that point, and reenergize for the fun evening yet to come.'
p4882
aS'After gathering themselves up to make their Grand Entrance into the Reception Hall they took a quick moment to view the scene from the balcony. They watched as their guests rose to their feet, champagne in hand, to grey the newlyweds as they danced their way into their reception to the song  Safe & Sound  by Capital Cities. It truly was a night of toasts, love, and memories they ll always treasure.\n'

S'When it came time to settle on a location for their long-awaited nuptials, Megan and Justin knew there was no spot better than his childhood home. And with a family of makers and designers to help them plan the day, their backyard wedding turned into an elegant affair with a black and white palette guiding every detail. A Sunshine Moment captured the beauty and lucky for you it s all waiting here!'
p4961
aS'From the Bride  Justin and I met in high school. We grew up in a small town, he was a senior and I was a freshman when we first met, so it was a big deal when we sparked a interest for one another. We both knew something was there between us, but we didn t start dating until years later. Due to various life events (mainly in part to the fact that we were both so young and at very different stages of our lives at that point in time), Justin and I went our separate ways and had little to no contact for 3 years. Then one day, I got a random text message from him. As he would say, he couldn t stop thinking about me and just decided to reach out to see if I would respond. Obviously fate has different intentions for us than we had expected. We began dating and the rest is history!'
p4962
aS'When Justin popped the question, we had been together for 6 years and both new we wanted to spend forever with each other, so of course I couldn t respond  YES  quick enough. Justin proposed in a fairytale-like way. Anyone who knows me, knows that I absolutely LOVE the holiday season. It truly is my favorite time of year, so when Justin popped the question on New Years Eve 2011, it made perfect sense. Going to plays is one of our things we love to do together, so weeks in advance he had planned a date night for us to go see Cinderella at a local theater and grab dinner at one of our favorite restaurants in the city. On the night of New Years Eve, 2011, we walked out of the play and it was snowing these huge, puffy, white gorgeous snowflakes, the sight was so beautiful it made me tear up   little did I know what was coming that would make me really cry. He asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the park that is across from the theater. The park had all the trees light up, dripping in gorgeous, sparkly white lights. We walked hand-in-hand, soaking up the beauty of the snow, loving that moment with each other . And then Justin got down on one knee and asked me to spend the rest of my life with him. It was truly a magical moment.'
p4963
aS'When we began discussing the details of our big day, we considered everything from getting married on a mountain top in Vancouver to a Chateau in the French countryside, but after much deliberation (over a year) we landed on home, literally, Justin s childhood home. Twenty acres of trees, rolling hills, and open grassland in a small town northwest of Minneapolis, Minnesota. A place that encompasses our history, our present lives and our future! Home is where the heart is, and that is truly the case for us. Justin isn t very emotional yet, the thought of celebrating our marriage surrounded by family and friends where he grew up brought tears to his eyes. At that moment, we knew the Zwieg home is where we needed to make the day! The close relationships with our family and friends is what means the most to us, so we wanted all of our loved ones to be a part of our special day.'
p4964
aS'One of the biggest challenges of our wedding was that we finally solidified the date and location four months (Yes   FOUR MONTHS!) before we said I do at the Zwieg home! Needless to say it was a busy four months for everyone involved, especially because we did most everything as a family thus, truly a  family affair!  Justin comes from a family of designers (Justin is an Art Director/Graphic Designer; his brother Jamison, is an Interior Designer; his Mom is a Designer, his dad isn t a designer per se, but he can make or do just about anything.) It only seemed fitting that we put all of our brains together and decide to conquer this fete together. Justin and I s big focus for the wedding was simple; we wanted it to be comfortable and welcoming for our guests, beautiful (in a tangible and intangible way) and we wanted it to feel like us, both as individuals and as a couple.'
p4965
aS'Our color palette was sophisticated with mostly black, white and silver with a little pop of pink for some fun! For us, everything is in the details, so every tiny aspect was planned out for very specific reasons. Justin designed our own personal crest, which we used throughout the wedding on large signs, coasters, and napkins. We plan to use this family crest for years to come! My mother-in-law planted all of the urns and outside arrangements, and made all of the bouquets. Our Mom s and Justin s siblings helped plan the entire wedding. My father-in-law had a rigorous mowing and watering schedule to ensure that the yard and plants were kept in impeccable condition throughout the heat of the summer. '
p4966
aS'My dad created the pergola structure where we got married underneath, cut all the wood slabs and loaned us his deer antlers for the nature element in the table centerpieces and throughout. My girlfriends helped me make the  Love is Sweet  sign on the dessert table and our table numbers. The guys all helped wrap the trees with white lights   dozens of trees! Justin s high school friend was our officiant. My brother-in-law, Jamison, is an incredible designer and he took all of the pieces we imagined, and all of our desires and turned the location into a masterpiece. He set every table with help of family members, added his black crystal chandelier to the pergola to add flair added some lamps to add ambiance and luxury to our head table he cut the grass in a cross cut pattern to make sure it was perfect for our walk down the aisle among so much of his design work. Jamison and I even went to Otten Brothers Nursery in Orono, MN (a family nursery on my Dad s side) and were able to borrow dozens of trees and shrubs to add to our estate d cor   wow! Everything, and I mean everything, about our wedding was done in four months and with the help of our families and friends. '
p4967
aS'Our big day was magical! We woke up to a beautiful, sunny, Minnesota summer day. The heat was on, not only temperature wise, but also getting everyone and everything ready for our 5pm event of our lifetimes. This past summer was one of the hottest summer in years. The girls got ready at my childhood home, while our families were rushing around at Justin s childhood home getting everything setup and in place. The time flew by! Before we knew it, guests were arriving and it was show time. The energy was high, love was in the air and the emotions were a roller coaster ride   this was the day that Justin and I had been looking forward to for years. As the ceremony began, the sky went from bright and sunny to dark grey. It was mystical, ethereal   but not a drop of rain fell. We got through our very intimate ceremony, did the entire receiving line and once every last guest was seated and Justin and I walked into the tent to start the reception   with a strike of lighting and a crack of thunder, it started pouring rain. The timing couldn t have been more perfect  it was a refreshing, summer evening rain that cooled the temperature down. '
p4968
aS'We weren t interested in the typical banquet food, so we hired a caterer that came onsite and grilled everything outside. We served delicious, comfort food that everyone loves   angus burgers, chicken sandwiches and mac  n cheese for the main course and dessert was a local bakery s delectable Tres Leche cake and my dad s famous homemade chocolate chip cookies. Our wedding was a black tie event, but Justin and I are passionate about good food and wanted our guests to really enjoy their dinner. Our menu juxtaposed with black tie attire was the casual elegance that we wanted to accomplish on our wedding day. After dinner, our fathers, siblings  and dearest friends gave the most touching speeches. Truly one of our most favorite moments of the evening. They were the longest, most thoughtful speeches I have ever experienced. There was not a dry eye in the house. After the speeches, we turned down the lights and danced the night away. Throughout the night the thousands of twinkle lights and bunches of tiki torches stayed light and sparkled all night. The rain added to the ambiance of the evening and according to an old fortune says that rain on your wedding day is good luck.'
p4969
aS'Our families and close-knit group of friends made everything come together perfectly. The day was an absolute dream come true. We couldn t have asked for a better celebration to mark the next chapter of our lives together. \n'

aS'From the beautiful Bride  Jakub and I were engaged on Sunday, February 24th. The day had started out just like most Sundays for us usually do, and I had no idea it would be one that I will never forget. We woke up, made breakfast, lounged around, it was actually a great morning. Jakub had told me we were going to a party with some of his friends from work so I got dressed and ready to go. I was waiting for him to finish getting ready when he came in the kitchen he told me there were a change of plans  I was so confused, I asked  What happened in the last five minutes that our plans have already changed!?!   I will never forget at that moment he walked up to me, got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I was SO suprised and overwhelmed, I didnt believe it was finally happening!! I screamed in shock for a few minutes before I finally said YES! I was shaking I was so excited and suprised  and the suprises didn t stop! '
p5051
aS'The next thing I knew we were leaving our apartment and there was a black car waiting for us out front. We got in and I tried to figure out where we were going next, but figured it out once we got out on Michigan Avenue. I had asked Jakub so many times to go on a horse and carriage ride but he would never cave :) There waiting for us was a horse (Fiona) and carriage waiting for our arrival. Before we hopped in though we of course stopped to get a celebratory glass of champagne! We asked the bartender to take a picture of us and I remember him saying  you guys are so cute  I replied  thanks we just got engaged!  He actually did not believe us at first and then I think by the ecstatic looks on both of our faces he knew we were not lying and gave us the glasses of champagne on the house. '
p5052
aS'The carriage ride was wonderful, we cruised down the lake around the best parts of the city, when coincidently we stopped at one of my favorite restaurants, Quartino s. I couldn t help to think that the day was just getting better and better, and then it did. When we walked in the waitress led us to a room where our parents and my sister and brother-in-law were waiting to congratulate us! I could not believe that he had planned this (and they all knew) weeks in advance! We had an amazing celebratory lunch and then headed home. Once we got home, Jakub told me I had one last suprise. This time we hopped in a cab (no black car this time, haha!) and it dropped us off at a wine bar in our neighborhood  When I walked in the door I knew then what was in store for me as I heard all of my friends laughter and voices. We walked in and I could not believe how many of our close friends had gathered to cheers our exciting news!! The day ended just as amazingly as it had begun. Not only had the love of my life asked me to marry him, but we also were able to celebrate our engagement with all of our favorite people in the world! It truly was perfect.\n'

S'The broaches in the bridal bouquet sold me on this whole shoot immediately. Not just because of the floral genius at Florals Etcetera, but just the general abundance of talent at Carrie Dayton Events, The Modern Hive, and Geoff Johnson Photography, just to name a few. It s not easy to do the mod-vibe without being overly kitschy, but this is so sophisticated, it could fit perfectly into the woods or an urban loft.'
p5088
aS'From Carrie Dayton Events  This sophisticated, hip  Mid-Century Modern Wedding  was created for a young professional, urban couple who lives a modern day lifestyle. They appreciate nature and have a passion for design. Mid-Century components were implemented throughout the day s events to emphasize the couple s bold personality and lifestyle. Repurposed furniture was selected and used as the inspiration for the couple s ceremony and reception. The rustic, outdoor setting lends maturity and trendiness to the style. Invitations were printed on wood to give guests the impression this was going to be a different wedding. Contemporary touches, such as the color palate, accent pieces, and flowers allure to a realistic setting for the 21st Century bride. The combination of these elements set the stage for this couple to express their personalities, style and most of all, love.'
p5089
aS'It was magical how such a large team of creative partners came together on this project including some who aren t in the wedding industry such as Hutch Furnishings and The Modern Hive who are in the furniture and interior design industry. The team worked together as if they had known each other for years. The day was seamless and flowed like a properly timed wedding. I chose the partners based on their amazing talent and  can do attitudes. '
p5090
aS'The bride and groom in the shoot are married and worked with me for their 2011 wedding. Courtney, the bride, is the owner of The Modern Hive and assisted with the design of the shoot. As the day progressed it was fun to watch their love and personalities come out on film. It was like reliving their wedding all over.\n'

S'Intimate weddings have always and will always be my favorite type of wedding. And when a wedding is intimate and styled to perfection by the seriously talented Bride and Groom (they designed all the stationery!), that s when I turn into a big pile of wedding-loving mush. Genevieve Nisly Photography was on hand to make sure each moment was captured beautifully, and you can see them all here.'
p5133
aS'We created custom gift baskets as gifts for the bridal party and parents. With the help of my mom, we created custom handkerchief favors for our guests that were hand stamped with the wedding logo we designed. We found and printed custom sepia tinted vintage family photos to be displayed at our reception in order to honor our family members that could not be with us that day. We created a framed logo sign for the welcome table that made use of a mercury glass technique, that I learned on the internet, and a hand cut stencil.'
p5134
aS'Our day was more amazing and made us happier than I ever imagined. It was just like everyone said, after months and months of hard work, the day was over in what felt like a few moments. I m so glad that we did everything exactly the way we wanted. We tried not to worry too much about classic wedding traditions and instead do things our own way. Neither one of us was very comfortable with the idea of dancing, so we hired a jazz pianist for our dinner reception and just hung out at the bar at the club after dinner. We all ended up playing the board game version of The Newlywed Game at the bar, which was so much fun and hilarious. I am so glad we decided to keep our wedding small and intimate. It created such a warm, inviting, and comfortable energy during the ceremony and after. It provided us with a great opportunity to bond more closely with our families and closest friends. I expected to be nervous during the ceremony, but I felt completely comfortable and elated to be surrounded by such a sweet group of our favorite people. We also decided to choose someone we both love and respect dearly to perform our wedding ceremony, which made it so special. Our friend Dennis was kind enough to go through the ordainment process in order to legally marry the two of us. He did such a fabulous job that most of our guests told him he should consider it as a career.'
p5135
aS'If I were to offer advice to any future brides, I would tell them to do things their way. Michael and I were together 9 years before we decided to get married. We spent many years of our relationship fielding the  so when are you guys getting married  question. I m so glad we waited until we were ready and knew exactly what we wanted from our wedding. It felt like a true reflection of the both of us because we waited until the time was right.\n'

S'Thanks to Erin Connelly Events and Yazy Jo your Wednesday morning is about to look a whole lot prettier. You see, these two teamed up for an inspiration shoot set at one of the dreamiest estates you ve ever seen, and the results? Something straight from a storybook. Sit tight my dears, because if you think this is good, just want  til you get your hands on the gallery.'
p5191
aS'From Erin Connelly Events When I first set eyes on this beautiful Georgian Estate in River Hills, Wisconsin, I thought I d be a perfect location for a wedding! The main home was built in 1929 by the nationally renowned architect, Fitzhugh Scott. The surroundings are equally as lovely. The landscape starts with terraced steps drawing you into acres of breathtaking manicured lawns, the pool rests to the side and the scent of the long dreamy double row of peony bushes draw you to the pond and dock. It reminded me of a bygone era. I couldn t wait to get started on the shoot!'
p5192
aS'I wanted my inspiration shoot to reflect that romantic setting and to compliment the lovely estate. Since the peonies were ready to bloom on the property it was only natural to use soft pinks, greens and shades of red to tie in the brick of the manor. It was truly such a highlight to see my planning, styling and flower arrangements come to life. Equally as exciting, I found an amazing team of vendors who made my vision come true. '
p5193
aS'Yazy Jo is the talented photographer who captured the play of light, the peaceful setting, that elegant world I was looking for, she really was a pleasure to work with. Alison and Theresa (hair and makeup team) worked their magic, were very kind and couldn t have been more helpful. And the models were nothing but delightful. It was the icing on the cake to find Kendell and Jane who own the Festive Frog. Not only are they both wonderful, they have a great eye. From their beautiful vintage plates, glasses and bar tables, to the stunning and delicate Delphine Manivet dress, it certainly was an unforgettable afternoon.'

S'I m a bit of a sap at weddings. I cry at every single one of them. It s gotten to the point where I can tell, if I were invited to the wedding, how much I would cry tears of happiness for the couple. Well, it is safe to say I would be a total mess at this wedding from Wildernesses Photography. Because the love this couple and their families have for each other is beautifully obvious, and you can see exactly what I mean here.'
p5235
aS'Stephanie and Lisa are both huge lovers of nature and the outdoors, so it made complete sense that they were going to tie the knot in the middle of a Minnesota forest. They wanted to be as eco-friendly and as DIY as possible, so their party favors for their guests were glass mason jars which they decorated with twine and name tags. The guests could bring their jar to the bartender and get it refilled with their beverage of choice all night long! Plus, they could then take their jar home and reuse it. It was a huge hit and everyone adored it.'
p5236
aS'The day was absolutely magical, and everything from the venue (a woodsy, rustic cabin in the pines of northern Minnesota) to the food (traditional Minnesota comfort food like prime rib and mashed potatoes) to the decor (freshly-cut wildflowers, vintage glass bottles and softly-glowing candles) was beyond perfect. It was an absolute dream come true for Stephanie, Lisa, their three kids, Cooper the dog, and their family and friends. If I could shoot this wedding again, I d do it in a heartbeat, no questions asked. That s how amazing it was.\n'

It s an addiction I happily embrace and now, my weekend activities are becoming a workday reality with this gorgeous Chicago wedding of our favorite prison guard, Susan Fischer. Squeals were most certainly heard  round the office when we laid eyes on this gem.

Take this Chicago couple who decided to hold their nuptials at The Bay Harbor Yacht Club in northern Michigan. The result was a stunning and laid-back getaway for them and their guests. Weber Photography was there to captured some lovely moments, and make sure to catch the video from Epic Motion at the end.'
p5334
aS'The vision of our wedding came from 3 places: attending countless friends and families  weddings, hundreds of visits to StyleMePretty.com  and the help of our talented, professional vendors. Jay and I attended 9 beautiful weddings the year prior to ours and found that our true excitement and passion would be memorable food, a band that could keep the dance floor full all night and a talented team that could capture our special day.'
p5335
aS'Jay had spent his childhood vacationing in Northern Michigan and we both really found that area special. Although we live in a great city, we wanted a wedding location away from home that was fun, laid-back with a sophisticated vibe, surrounded by nature, water and sunset views. Picking Northern Michigan came naturally after we visited the Bay Harbor Yacht Club and the charming town of Charlevoix. The Bay Harbor Yacht Club view provided ambiance, class and an amazing outside terrace to enjoy cocktail hour and a Northern Michigan sunset. As an extra bonus it was away from a big city, traffic and crowds, which gave it a  destination-like  feel without getting out your passport and still feeling homey.'
p5336
aS'We made the drive from Chicago on Thursday along with almost all of our guests to take full advantage of the luxury of time and a full weekend with our friends and family. On Friday, the men had a golf tournament while the ladies went to brunch, spa and relaxed at the hotel pool with live music. The wedding party reconnected at the rehearsal dinner that night to prepare for the wedding on Saturday. We were married by our priest who made the 7 hour drive from Chicago. It was very special to have a piece of home with us. Saint Mary s was very inviting and helpful to allow us to bring our own priest.'

aS'The ballroom was a charming, open, bright space. We created a warm, romantic, inviting atmosphere by using whites, grays, metallic, and metals with a slightly rustic and eclectic look. I love mixing mercury glass and metallic with different candelabras heights, bowls and candles.'
p5338
aS'Our flowers were blush pink and ivory garden roses, with eucalyptus, white anemone, dusty peonies, hydrangeas, white freesia with a touch of accents of greenery.  StyleMePretty provided our inspiration to layer gray linens with lace. Our wedding planner and florist helped us find an amazing, fun, chic sequence linen to use for the highboy tables around the dance floor.'
p5339
aS'For a special touch we got 8 huge balloons for fun props in our wedding party pictures. The balloons were also a hit with the kids! At the reception we had an interactive candy station and late night food which was a lot of fun. Everyone got to create their own candy goodie bag for their drive home the next day. The wine and food was handpicked and created with local vendors. The catering team and head chief used all local food and produce which we loved supporting local vendors.  '
p5340
aS'We had an amazing wedding weekend and loved every minute of it. Our vendors were truly talented professionals that I would recommend over and over. They made planning from a long distance a piece of (wedding) cake!\n'

S'Gold and blush run through out veins over here at SMP, it s true. So when a shoot as pretty as this one planned around those two beautiful hues lands in our lap, we simply can t wait to share it with all of you. Planned by Cassie Mullins Event Planning & Design with florals from Blush Custom Weddings, a picture perfect cake from A Cupcake A Day, gorgeous gown from The Dress Bridal Boutique and topped off with stunning photography by Studio Elle Photography  - this type of pretty is just too good not to share.'
p5375
aS'We decided on a soft palette to give a cohesive look next to the marble backdrop. The gold was perfect to mix in a hint of warmth to the winter day, while the soft blush accents added a touch of color. We decided that a classic black-tie look for the couple would the perfect compliment to such an elegant venue.\n'

S'There s nothing better   and more Midwestern   than sitting in a barn at season s change, watching hues of gold take the rolling hills. Add a wedding, and that, my friends, is pure magic. Planner Lizie Anne helped her hippie-hearted bride make her countryside nuptials as chic and lovely as can be. The pictures from Joanna Day Photography speak for themselves and you can find even more in the full gallery.'
p5417
aS'From Lizie Anne Weddings  Justin and Christina desired a wedding that was full of family and love. With an intimate setting at Hope Glen Farm as the backdrop, we created the perfect wedding for them.'
p5418
aS'I like to think that Christina is half hippy, so I designed the wedding with that always in the back of my mind! From the lace to the floral crown   nothing was overlooked in making sure Christina s vision was spot on!'
p5419
aS'Perhaps the most stunning design piece brought in, was the lush greenery chandelier that hung over their heads for the ceremony. We later situated that same chandelier over the head table. With the rolling meadow in behind them, and the head table dripping with greenery as well, it was a picture perfect scene. All the floral had the hand picked, straight from the fields look to it, and complimented perfectly.'
p5420
aS'I brought in some hand cut larger wood pieces for the unity candle and family bible, and painted them white to give it more of a polished / yet perfectly rustic look. To compliment those, I placed smaller pieces of wood down the aisle with candles sitting atop.'
p5421
aS'Vintage chargers and vintage dish-ware made the family style meal that much more perfect! During dinner, Christina and Justin sang a song they wrote to their guests. Not many eyes were dry following that!'
p5422
aS'To give honor to Justin who is in the air force and Christina s dad who just left the air force, they had a table set aside for those who could not share the day with them.'
p5423
aS'The guests enjoyed a late night popcorn bar as they danced or lounged in the vintage couches surrounding them. The perfect end to a perfect day for the sweetest couple.\n'

The towering mansion, beautiful gardens and breathtaking staircase are enough to woo any lover of weddings, but throw in the expertise of North Shore Weddings and Events and Deonna Caruso and, well  perfection, lovelies.  See it all here.'
p5459
aS'And a little something special from Twelve Twelve Studios  enjoy.'
p5460
aS'From The Bride The Armour Mansion at Lake Forest Academy truly was the quintessential venue for a fairytale wedding. The venue s old world charm, lavish gardens, and breathtaking architecture left all of our guests speechless. Choosing this venue was very special bonding moment for my father and me, as he handpicked this venue to give away his little girl. Interestingly, Jonathan Ogden Armour shared the same sentiments; designing a grandiose bridal staircase in the mansion for his daughter. This historic mansion set the ambiance and overall design of our wedding. As we planned our honeymoon in Tuscany, Italy, we also wanted to make our guests feel like they had escaped to an Italian countryside. Our guests filled the lush gardens, as the harpist played  The Gentle Maiden , Irish Air, in significance of my husband and my family s Irish decent.'
p5461
aS'From Deonna Caruso Photography  On July 13, 2013, Dana Parkhill and Frank Miller were married at the beautiful Armour House in Lake Forest. What a perfect day for an outdoor wedding and when I say perfect, it was truly that! The day could not have been better for the two of them. Dana and Frank met each other a couple of years ago through a mutual friend. When they first met their friend said  Mr. Nice Guy meet Mrs. Nice Girl.   When you meet both of them you realize that pretty much sums it up. After they met each other they dated and endured a long-distance relationship for awhile. Frank was finishing up undergrad at Wake Forest in North Carolina and Dana was finishing graduate school in Bloomington, Indiana. They spent summers together and saw each other when they could. When Frank graduated in 2012, he came to Bloomington and got a job. They were so grateful to finally be in the same town! Frank proposed to Dana at a local winery in Bloomington in October of 2012 and the rest is history. When you see the two of them together you can see how much love and respect they have for each other and it was such an honor to capture their gorgeous wedding day!'

S'Take some rustic chic goodness and add in a little vintage charm all designed by a bride who knows a thing or two about planning the perfect wedding (she owns Dixie Bleu Events, after all) and the results are amazing.  Think bundles of baby s breath meets galvanized pails meets burlap tied bouquets.  See it all captured in beautiful images by Redeeming Love Photography right here.'
p5533
aS'From the Bride (Dixie Bleu Events)  We wanted our wedding to be a reflection of us, so we took the best of the midwest country boy and the southern wildflower and combined it together with a country, vintage, DIY, flea-market twist. The wedding had the comfort of the midwest corn fields and country feel with a splash of southern charm. My mother and I went to auctions, antique stores, goodwills and yard sales all over to collect pieces that captured our personalities and upbringing. It turned the wedding planning into an adventure trying to find over 200 vintage floral china plates and milk glass from all over Southern Illinois.'
p5534
aS'The wedding was a family DIY project, everyone pitched in someway or another. We had our families  heirlooms and hard work all around us on our special day. It gave the wedding a touch of warmth and family pride, we felt as though every piece had a funny story or memory attached.'
p5535
aS'The wooden centerpieces came from the woods at York Farms, cut in his saw mill by Justin s grandfather (DIY). The flag bunting that hung in the tent was hand-sewn by my 80-year-old grandmother (DIY). The vintage linens were hand sewn by Justin s grandmother from the 60 s & 70 s (Heirloom). The golden deer antlers were found in the York Farm Woods (DIY). The vintage china, milk glass, mason jars, wooden doors, suitcases, and vintage furniture were collected by my mother and me. The straw bales were baled from York Farms. The Model T Ford was donated and driven by a life-long family friend of the York s. The antique quilts donated by friends and family.'
p5536
aS'My something old was my late grandfather s hankee sewed into my dress. My something borrowed were Alpha Delta Pi Sorority pins from Andi s sorority sisters and bridesmaids Carly, Kelli, and Becca. My something new were monogrammed hankee from my momma. My something blue was my Florida Gator garter and a six pence in my shoe. My wedding and engagement rings were custom designed and made from my mother s rings.'

Studio Starling was behind the lens to make sure we didn t miss a single gorgeous detail, and they are all waiting for you right here.'
p5582
aS'From Studio Starling Their event and ceremony were held at the stunning Rookery. With this architectural icon as their starting point, the couple used the theme of Chicago architecture throughout their wedding plans. We made photographs on LaSalle street, near the Calder and also traveled to Olive Park for a skyline view. Inside the venue Sweet Chic Events pulled the event together with flowers by Scarlet Petal and architecture themed table numbers, cards and signage, all designed by the bride s adorable sister.'
p5583
aS'Although the day started a bit stressful for the couple, the act of going outside, walking around our beautiful city and having fun making photographs really helped the day be fun and carefree.'
p5584
aS'From Sweet Chic Events It was a pleasure working with Rebecca and Ty on their wedding. The Rookery is one of the most beautiful and historic event spaces in Chicago and their wedding vision was a lot of fun to be a part of. Theirs was truly a labor of love and all of the details were amazing and personalized. It was a pleasure working with this wonderful couple and helping make their day truly special!\n'

S'I never tire of seeing what our beauteous brides will come up with next. And when it comes to DIY? Brides, you kill it. With the help of planning extraordinaire Naturally Yours Events, this glowing Bride (and Groom!) prettied up their day with handmade goodness all around, including those fancy chalkboard signs, which I m in love with. See every last bit right here in the gallery from Allison Williams Photography.'
p5661
aS'From Naturally Yours Events  Liz and Joe chose to get married on the grounds of a garden shop in a small town outside of Chicago. The ceremony took place in a beautiful nook of the property nestled by exposed brick walls and cascading greenery. Liz and Joe added a ceremony backdrop of wooden embroidery rounds with ferns attached that hung from the exposed rafters. The couple stood on a vintage rug while the Groom s brother officiated the wedding. Guests watched the nuptials from wooden mismatched chairs and the couple s parents had a VIP spot on vintage plush chairs. This outdoor ceremony couldn t have been more beautiful!'
p5662
aS'The reception place was just as lovely with barn-like details and vintage hoosier cabinets. Liz and Joe dressed up the dance floor with hanging vintage books and lacy paper mache lanterns. The centerpieces incorporated a mix of hand-painted mason jars and repurposed glass bottles with romantic blooms in shades of orange, peach, ivory, and green. The detail to love is the beautiful muslin table numbers and the table runners with ivory damask detailing.'
p5663
aS'Liz also handmade the guestbook, favor bags, and all the chalkboard signage. They used those chalkboards for the signature bar menu as well as ceremony information for their guests. The guestbook was a framed 3D heart art piece that guests were encouraged to sign. Their favors were seeds where guests could take some of the garden home with them after the evening.'
p5664
aS'Photography is very important to Liz and Joe, so they made sure to incorporate their favorite photos and vintage cameras collections in the hoosier cabinet. You see, Liz and Joe are wedding photographers themselves and are now a husband and wife team! They made sure to find a photographer that they loved and Allison Williams captured their day beautifully!\n'

p5700
aS'\n1. Use a hair volumizing powder at the roots and backcomb the hair.\n 2. Gently comb the hair smooth.\n 4. Section the hair into 4 quadrants. Leave some hair at the nape of the neck out of the lower quadrants.\n 5. Make a loose braid in each quadrant.\n 6. Criss-cross the braids on top of the head and secure with bobby pins at the scalp.\n 7. Take the end of a rat tail comb or with the end of skinny makeup brush and gently lift and loosen the braids.\n 8. Take the remaining hair (at the nape of the neck) and softly twist several sections up into the style and secure with bobby pins.\n 9. Spray with a medium hold hair spray.\n 10. Scan areas that might need to be adjusted and sculpt into place with your hand. Secure with pins and spray to hold.'

aS'PRETTY IN PINK MAKEUP IN 10 STEPS.'
p5702
aS'\n1. Prep the skin with moisturizer and primer(s)- face, lid and lip.\n 2. Use 3 different hues of pink on the eyelid. Start with a darker pink with lash line to crease. A mid-tone pink in the crease. And a light and shimmery pink at the brow bone.\n 3. Use a mid-tone grey eyeshadow to line the top and bottom lash line. Use a clean brush to smudge and soften the line.\n 4. Use a black eyeshadow to do a tight line on the lash line and on the upper water line of lid.\n 5. Apply black mascara and then apply false eyelashes.\n 6. Use an ash- toned eyeshadow to define the brows.\n 7. Apply concealer in areas that need to be concealed or evened out- around the nose, cheeks, under the eyes.\n 8. Apply a tinted moisturizer that matches the undertone of skin all over the face.\n 9. Apply a blue based pink blush on the apples of the cheeks.\n 10. Finish with a pale pink lip gloss.'
p5703
aS'DIY BOUQUET'
p5704
aS'\n1. Wet green bouquet holder.\n 2. Start at the very bottom of the bouquet holder and place branches in a horizontal line around the front half of the bouquet holder.\n 3. Make sure to use thin branches because thick branches will tear up the bouquet holder and then fall out.\n 4. Work your way up the bouquet, creating row on top of row of branches until you re a row or two from the very top.\n 5. Use a glue gun to secure any loose or larger branches into the bouquet holder.\n 6. Once the front is done, take small sprigs and place them in the back or where there is still green bouquet holder showing.\n 7. To add length to the bouquet wire the top of a branch to the bottom of a branch already in the bouquet holder. We only did this 3-4 times or else it was getting too heavy and looked misshaped.\n 8. Wrap something around the bouquet stem to make it look pretty. We used birch bark with some newspaper underneath to add width. But you could use fur, ribbon, or fabric!\n 9. If you d rather not DIY your bouquet we would love to recommend Munster Rose, Studio Fleurette, and Ashley Fox Designs to create a bouquet that looks like this one here.'
p5705
aS'DIY CROWN'
p5706
aS'\n1. Start with a somewhat bendable branch of greens.\n 2. Wire two branches together with about a one inch overlay.\n 3. Wire the branches together on the other side to create a circles.\n 4. Repeat making circles until desired thickness is achieved and then wire branches together. We did this twice to create the thickness pictured above.\n 5. If wiring is showing, hot glue a leaf or two on wire to cover it.'
p5707
aS'DIY GLASSES'
p5708
aS'\n1. Get a space ready for painting by laying down newspaper.\n 2. Place tape around the bottom of stem of glass so there s a straight chalk board line.\n 3. Paint the base of the glass with the chalkboard paint.\n 4. Let dry about 30 minutes.\n 5. Paint again 2-3 times.\n 6. Remove tape slowly.\n 7. Use chalk pen instead of normal chalk because normal chalk will scratch paint off of glass.'
p5709
aS'DIY BOTTLE CANDLES'
p5710
aS'\n1. Gather a collection of glass bottles in your desired height, shape, and color. We used all clear glasses.\n 2. Remove all labels and foils on bottles using Goo Gone or soaking in water for a while.\n 3. Purchase tapered candles in a variety of heights that are also tapered on the bottom to fit a standard size candle holder.\n 4. Gently twist the candles into the bottles until they are well secured.\n 5. Working in a warm environment will help the candles twist into the bottles without breaking.\n 6. You can quickly burn the edge of the candle closest to the bottle neck to secure if still loose. Make sure to do this quickly because it will cause black the candle to turn black.'

p5754
aS'From the Bride  While Alex and I consider ourselves Chicago city-dwellers, we always knew we wanted a wedding that was God-honoring and tucked away in a beautiful setting that would be filled with lots of sweet, quiet moments.'
p5755
aS'After being engaged for less than 72 hours, we booked the Pavilion at Orchard Ridge Farms. The venue was everything we could have ever dreamed of. Located in Rockton, IL, it was the perfect back drop to our vision of our wedding day   rustic, serene, and tucked away in the country of northern Illinois. Our families stayed at the gorgeous Copperstone Inn, a bed-and-breakfast adjacent to the Pavilion. We were married on a hill underneath two oak trees on what turned out to be a gorgeous, cool fall day in September.'
p5756
aS'Our blush and gold d cor theme was the perfect complement to the rustic but elegant structure of the Pavilion. We worked with Anna of Beautiful Day Linens to choose the perfect blush lamour to add warmth to the open space. We used La Tavola s copper sparkly linen for our escort card table. Faith, of The Floral Company, worked with us to create beautiful arrangements that fulfilled both of our desires for blush-family florals with a rustic touch. Faith hand painted each of the gold planter boxes for our centerpieces! Kathy of Sugar Jones bakery created the most delicious blush-frosting cupcakes that guests continue to rave about. Our favors were warm cinnamon-sugar cider donuts and half pints of apple cider from Edwards Orchard nearby.'
p5757
aS'When we met with Paul of Abreo restaurant in Rockford, we discussed our vision for a very rustic and seasonal, farm-to-table culinary experience. We could not have chosen a better caterer to partner with! Paul knocked it out of the park with a menu consisting of beef short ribs and roasted chicken paired with roasted root vegetables and fresh herb parmesan polenta. Our guests said it was  the best wedding food  they ve ever had!'
p5758
aS'Other details from our wedding day included DIY projects we tackled throughout the months leading up to our wedding   Craigslist hunting for a large window for the fireplace mantle, a Polaroid photo booth, and designing our gold-foil and blush invitation suite.'
p5759
aS'Our wedding would not have been what it was without the amazing support of our families and friends, and the creative direction of our vendors especially our wedding planners Michelle Durpetti Events, Kacie Benjamin of The Pavilion, photographer Jen Badalamenti of Jen Lynne Photography, and videographers, Laura and Stephen Drew of Brittania Drew. We were so blessed by this amazing group of people who worked seamlessly together. Because of their collaboration and flawless execution of our creative details, we were able to enjoy all the sweet and joyous moments of our beautiful day!'

S'While most couples dream of sunny, Spring weddings this Chicago duo was quite the opposite. They chose to embrace the city s wintertime beauty, and the results? Pure magic. Dive right into JPP Studios  captures to see for yourself!'
p5834
aS'From JPP Studios  This showcases the magic of a winter wedding. I think it s fair to say that most people have a negative impression of winter and weddings during this time of year, as a whole, are mostly overlooked. However the typical winter elements that discourage people (i.e. staying indoors, snow, cold weather, minimal daylight, etc) are actually what make this Chicago wedding shine. Despite the fact that the wedding reception took place in an industrial building within a dense, urban city, the whole affair felt very cozy and intimate. The beautiful decor and ambient lighting created a rustic and almost rural feel, as if you were around a camp fire. Much of the success is owed to the coordinator, Miss Daniels, for tying everything together and making the ship sail smoothly. Lastly, to top it all off, it snowed that day and despite what the skeptics might say, a winter day in Chicago can be a very beautiful and romantic place.\n'

S'Believe it or not, this bride s grandmother was about 90 years ahead of the whole colored wedding dress trend. Seriously! This is her grandmother s handmade wedding dress from the 1920 s, that s as stunning today as it was back then. Paired with a vintage hat, the Groom s seersucker suit, and lovely pictures from Jennifer Kathryn, and we have a brunch garden party wedding worth fawning over. Check out the gallery for the full bloom.'
p5858
aS'From the bride: Matt and I met online, on OKCupid. I was Matt s first ever Internet date! :) When we met in person for the first time, we met at Maxwell s, a famous music venue and bar near my apartment. We we re having a great conversation, and all of a sudden Matt stood up and said,  I have to go! I m late for rehearsal!  I have often teased him that you re supposed to have an exit strategy in case the date is not going well, not somewhere you have to be even if it is going well! :)'
p5859
aS'The first thing I noticed was his nose. He has this lovely Roman nose, but he didn t post any profile shots on his OKCupid page, so it was a surprise to me. I love his nose! What he noticed about me was my optimism. On our first date we talked about Israel, and I told him one day I ll take him there and show him the country from the locals  perspective. He loved that I was already making world travel plans on our first date. We re actually living in Israel together now, so I came through on my promise!'
p5860
aS'Matt will tell you that when he left our first date he thought,  I should call my mom and tell her I met the girl!  He ll tell you (as he told me when he proposed) that he loved me from the moment he saw me. For me, it took longer. I needed to get to know him before I gave my heart away. But once I did, there has never been a doubt in my mind. I don t think there was  a moment  when we knew we were in this together forever. As we got to know each other we learned that we were two strange peas in a strange pod, and we wanted to sign up to spend a lifetime together in that pod. We are in  mutual weirdness,  which is love, according to Dr. Seuss.'
p5861
aS'The brunch at the Cheney Mansion was Matt s parents  idea. Because we were having a very small wedding in Connecticut, they wanted to throw a party to celebrate with Matt s friends and family in Chicago, where he grew up. They, along with Matt s sister, Joan, owner and lead planner at Five Grain Events, chose the venue and planned most of the details. Matt s mother even potted lovely flowers for the tables. But, I am totally obsessed with the 1920 s and 1930 s, so as soon as Matt s parents suggested a brunch I said,  Garden Party!!!  We bought Matt a seersucker suit and boater hat. I wore my great-grandmother s handmade wedding dress (circa the late 20 s or early 30 s) and made a hat to match. Matt made a custom playlist of Jazz Age songs, and we let the guests know that hats and parasols were welcome. Matt is down for whatever makes me happy; I m a lucky lady!\n'

S'For this Chicago duo, the only  rule  in wedding planning was that there were no rules. Set in an industrial-style warehouse, they opted for a cocktail party reception in lieu of a sit down dinner and made sure every detail spoke to their story along the way. Natural Beauties Floral glammed up space with rich-hued bloomage and you can see it all through Stoffer Photography s lens right here.'
p5956
aS'To play up the party vibe and compliment the raw materials in our venue, we chose rich colors like sapphire navy, ox blood red florals and gold metallic accents. There were no rules to any of the details   we just made sure we asked ourselves at every decision point if this was staying true to who we were. That method took the pressure off doing what was  in  or what our other engaged friends were doing. In the end, the evening felt cohesive and we regretted none of our decisions. For the ceremony, Aaron and I wanted to create an atmosphere of inclusion and unity, and used several elements to pull this together. Tea lights lined the walls and an assortment of hurricane candles were placed at the  altar  space. '
p5957
aS'Friends and family were asked to sit where they felt comfortable; readings were both secular and spiritual. Our close friend officiated the ceremony and incorporated personal anecdotes into his marriage address. That, while being surrounded by family and friends, lead to a powerful and moving experience and absolutely the best part of the day. As we were announced husband and wife, our guests blew New Year s Eve paper horns as a celebratory tribute to how we met. The Ravenswood Event Center s Industrial Ballroom had the perfect space for a  strolling cocktail party.  The center used passed dishes, food stations and carted treats to keep the flow moving. Andy and Jen at REC dreamed up a menu that reflected our tastes (which is anything but fancy) but added a creative spin (think grilled leek and shrimp quesadillas, and honey and prosciutto white sauce flatbread). Even though it was a cocktail party, our guests left stuffed and couldn t stop talking about the food. I wanted to be very hands-on with the wedding crafts but for projects beyond my capabilities I enlisted the help of some very talented and creative family and friends. '
p5958
aS'My aunt   a talented cake decorator   has made me my birthday cakes since I was born. To keep tradition, she baked and decorated a special wedding cake for us to enjoy. My uncle   a carpenter   built the outside sandwich board which my cousin hand-painted. All the paper goods   from the invites to the program to the little food signs   were all designed by a dear friend. And my dad built all the ceremony pedestals (which are now re-purposed as nightstands in our tiny Chicago apartment). All the other details were chosen because they had special meaning to Aaron and me. Our signature drink   the May-garita   was not only titled after our new married name (May) but also a nod toward our love affair of Mexican food. Cocktail napkins displayed  fun facts  about us; discovering these were an amusing ice breaker during cocktail hour and got the guests going back to the bar to collect more. '
p5959
aS'Other personal touches included wrapping my bouquet with my late grandmother s handkerchief, using my mother s ring pillow (with our embroidered wedding date below her s) and using my late grandma s blue bird pin as my  something blue.  Even our dessert table included frosting shots (tiny cups of vanilla frosting) as it is oddly my favorite treat from the bakery. Aaron s dad has long personal ties to Superdawg and made sure the famous Chicago dogs were served as a late night snack. At the end of the night, our guests were treated to an assortment of our favorite sweets which they could enjoy on their way home. The day was unforgettable and emotionally overwhelming in the best way possible. We couldn t be more grateful for the love of our family and friends, and the talent and care of our vendors. '

S'Washington Island looks like it was plucked off the shores of Cape Cod and plopped right down in the middle of Wisconsin with weathered shingle cottages, boat filled ports and loads of hydrangeas and peonies all photographed by M Three Studio Photography. And what better spot for a charming destination affair? Planned by Seize The Day Events, this gem is a summertime love fest.'
p6001
aS'From M Three Studio Photography Door County is a true gem of the midwest, and Washington Island is it s best hidden secret! The rural and tiny island has tons of New England sea-town-style charm, wrapped in a healthy dose of  northwoods . Megan and Matt brought all of their guests to the tiny island (accessible only by ferry) for a destination wedding right where they fell in love. The Bride had grown up summering on the island and at her grandparent s home there, and when she met Matt, she brought him along. In her toast to her husband that night, she mentioned how  this is where I learned to ride a bicycle, where I learned to swim, and where I fell in love with you. And now it is where I married my best friend. .'
p6002
aS'The Bride s shabby-chic style mixed with the Groom s preppy sensibilities for a sweet and playful wedding that highlighted all the island has to offer. Guests were escorted around the 15 square-mile island by the  cherry train , an island tradition. Tables were adorned with vintage glass, fresh blooms and New Glarus Brewing Company Growlers, one of Wisconsin s most loved micro-brews.'
p6003
aS'One of the most touching moments of the day was within the first look. Just after that first sight, both the bride and groom pulled out hand-written vows and had their own private ceremony right there on the Jackson Harbor dock. It was just the two of them, and such a great start to an emotional, fun and beautiful day.\n'

aS'From the Bride  Dan and I met on a biking trip in the California wine country. My family and I arrived in California excited to bike, eat, and drink wine! We met up with my uncle and cousin who accompanied us and 20 other strangers on this organized trip. I met Dan that first morning when he introduced himself as one of three trip leaders and handed me my bike for the week. I thought nothing of it. As the week progressed, the leaders biked and ate with the group, guiding us on our tour of the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. There was some flirtation going on, but I was not interested or looking at the time. I had just moved out to Seattle, WA from Columbus, OH days earlier hoping to jump start my career. Besides, growing up it was always my sister who attracted all the attention. I figured that would be the case here as well.'
p6072
aS'My sister and mom are quite perceptive however, and they mentioned early on that they felt Dan was clearly more interested in me. We began spending more time talking, but Dan was busy entertaining 20 other guests as well. On the last day of the trip, my sister was biking way too fast approaching a sharp hairpin turn and she crashed. Torn up, shook up, and bruised, she headed off to the hospital in a van with Dan. On their drive she inquired,  what s up with you and my sister?  She proceeded to give him the in s and out s of how to go about pursuing me, and he did just that! This was the start of our relationship filled with romance and adventure!'
p6073
aS'Dan continued to work for Backroads for the next few years, and his last trip with the company took him to New Zealand and Vietnam for the Winter season. His parents and I headed out for a visit to meet him in Vietnam. On the Vietnamese New Year we were in Dan s favorite town Hoi An. That night he gave me my belated Christmas present (since we weren t together for the holiday). It was a homemade scrap book of our relationship with an engagement ring on the last page! We couldn t wait to start planning our special day!'
p6074
aS'I knew I wanted to be married in my home town of Columbus, OH. My mom jumped on booking venues right away. Things seemed to be booked for weekends in 2012 already being that our engagement was in January of that year. It was booked every weekend but Thanksgiving and a few in December. We threw out the date of New Year s Eve and it was available so we went with it! It seemed like the perfect date because I never have New Year s plans, it s a great time for a celebration, and our theme was automatically decided for us! A brand new Hilton was being built and set to open just before our wedding date   we jumped on the chance to be the first wedding at the new beautiful property. It was a pretty special experience to go from hard hat tours of a shell of a building to seeing our lovely wedding come to life in their exquisite ballroom.'
p6075
aS'The first chance I had to try on wedding dresses was at La Jeune Marie on a trip home to Columbus. As most brides say, I had something totally different in mind than what I chose! I only tried on about five dresses before  the one . I absolutely fell in love with my Anna Maier gown   it was perfect for the season. There were certainly challenges planning a Columbus wedding while I was living in Seattle, so I could not have been more happy for my mom when she paired up with Adrianne from Adrianne Elizabeth Events for planning. Adrianne was the best support for both my mom and I and we could not have pulled it off without her!'
p6076
aS'We had a blast personalizing the wedding and making it fun and festive for the new year. Clay from Red Gallery Photography even flew out to do our engagement shoot in Seattle at all the locations we went on our first date, we used these pictures throughout the wedding decor. We served my favorite, Jeni s Ice Cream, at the reception to celebrate my love of Jeni s and the fact that used to bike race on the team in Columbus sponsored by Jeni s.'
p6077
aS'We had a photo booth for guests to enjoy and now have a great keepsake in place of a guest book. It even snowed light fluffy white snow the day of the wedding for some gorgeous moments captured by our photographer and videographer. The highlight was at 5 minutes before midnight when we popped tiny cans of Sofia champagne and watched our  Same Day Edit  Video from Studio Z Films. The video captured the entire day from start to finish and ended with a countdown to the new year which culminated with a perfectly timed confetti drop. It was a day I will never forget! Plus, being that it was the New Year holiday, I never have to worry about my husband forgetting our anniversary, either!'
p6078
aS'Planner Note The DiCello Family and Alicia and Dan were truly special clients. Alicia and her mom, Anita, have exquisite taste. The wedding was soft, beautiful, warm, and inviting and perfectly fitting for an elegant New Year s Eve affair. From the very start, the DiCello s set out to be gracious hosts to their guests. From a delicious New Year s Eve meal paired with the families favorite wines, Silver Oak, Churchill Cellars and Twomey to Uncle Mike s extraordinarily beautiful and delicious cookie table to the framed photos of the couple s parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents on their wedding day, every detail was personal. It was truly a New Year s Eve Celebration to remember.\n'

S'I ve always been a black & white girl. Simple, pretty, classic. So when I see other couples who planned their days with that very same mindset, I tend to feel like kindred spirits.  Jai Girard captured the photo goodies and Studio 272 put together the film, so what are you waiting for? Dive straight into this love story right over here!'
p6146
aS'From The Bride Set on a rainy October day, our wedding tied together all the fairytale moments that I hoped for on our special day. The locations of our ceremony and reception seemed to fit perfectly with our close ties to home, and our love of nature and the outdoors. Marc and I met and fell in love in Colorado. After an injury to my foot from running, I wanted to learn how to swim for exercise. He gave me swim lessons for a couple of years until he went away to grad school in Arizona. We spoke on the phone for hours talking about our dating life and giving one another advice. Marc would come back to visit on his breaks from school. Over the course of the 6 years that we knew one another, we became very close friends and eventually fell in love when Marc injured his back on a visit to Colorado, and was immobile on my floor for weeks.'
p6147
aS'We were married in a magical little church called Kenilworth Union Church in Kenilworth, IL. I wanted the church to be cozy filled with all of our favorite people. The church was perfect for our vision. I loved the fantasy that a little hobbit might pop out from behind a stone wall, or that the vines growing up the sides of the church walls might come to life. The church itself reflected a similar feel for our love. Cozy and comfortable, but romantic too.'
p6148
aS'We drove to a pier at Lake Michigan afterwards to take some photographs in front of the water. Even though it was raining, there was something really peaceful about being at the lake front and breathing the fresh air. It was a way for us to tie in our love of the water, and spend a few moments reflecting. It s one of the moments I remember very vividly despite all the chaos of a wedding day. I remember feeling really refreshed by the crispness of the Fall air coming off the water. Just to look out on the water with the one I love felt like the best thing ever. It was a very special moment.'
p6149
aS'For our reception, A 10,000 square foot tent was built on my parent s property in Bannockburn, IL for our 200 person wedding. The tent took over a week to build, and nearly a week to tear down. The look of the reception was romantic and soft, but had some edginess at the same time. We knew we wanted it to be a big occasion for our guests to wear their prettiest dresses and most handsome tuxedos and suits. The colors were black and white, eggplant purple, and mossy greens. We focused a lot on texture to bring the outside natural elements into the tent. One of my favorite parts was the holes that were put in the tent to bring some of the tree branches in. While the wedding was black tie and elegant, we didn t stray far from the earthy wooded feel we wanted to keep. I love the feel of mixing sparkly elements with organic elements. The juxtaposition of  dress-up glamour  and the beauty of nature pair together in a really unusually awesome way.'
p6150
aS'I wish we could go back in time and do it all over again. My Dad did an amazing job documenting the build of the tent and the tear down. I think our photographs tell the story of the excitement of seeing the event come to life, the joy and beauty of the moments we had during the event, and the bittersweet feelings as it all came to a close. Our videographer wrapped the day together in a lovely little package.'
