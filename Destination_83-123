S'If I m being honest, Guatemala has never really been on my radar as a vacation destination.  But this beautiful wedding made me realize that, well  I m basically crazy.  Because any locale as stunning as this is one I need to visit sooner, rather than later.  And tying the knot with my honey amongst the breathtaking backdrops and amazing ruins?  Even better.  See it all captured by Stacy Able right here.'
p24
aS'And an amazing film from Katie Destry?  Yes, please.'
p25
aS'From the Bride  I knew that I wanted to have our wedding in San Jose el Viejo when Chris and I first drove by the ruins together. An event was going on there and it was so beautiful. After we got engaged we went for a site visit to reserve it. Addy s Florales was there doing an event that day. We met Beatriz, the florist and decided to go with them after seeing their designs and creativity within the ruins. I wanted really simple and elegant colors to not distract from the beauty of the ruins. I chose cream and gold with accents of purple. Beatriz from Addy s Florales and Maya from Hotel Antigua were both awesome with seeing the vision of simple elegance.'
p26
aS'One of my favorite moments was my dad s speech followed by our dance. Chris and I also both loved that Ignacio from Buena vista social club was able to play. We love his music and have enjoyed getting to know him and hear stories about Cuba and his past. He is so talented and we were really blessed to have him share in our day. I loved riding to the ceremony in Tuk Tuks. I think the bridesmaids loved it as well.'
p27
aS'From Stacy Able Photography  When Kamille and Chris emailed me about shooting their wedding I was ecstatic. Being the adorable pair met in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, it was only fitting their wedding was to take place in Guatemala. Thankfully, with me shooting digital and Katie filming we were able to be a part of their celebration and were super excited.'
p28
aS'Chris and Kamille s wedding day was a mild 70-degree day with a few clouds hovering over the volcano which overlooks Antigua. The Porta Hotel near the San Jose el Viejo was the perfect backdrop for the bridesmaids and bride to get ready. A Tuk Tuk (mini Guatemalan taxi) ride away was the ceremony, where Chris and groomsman and guests were playing corn holl. After the I do s, Katie and I had the bridal party and newlyweds stroll through the cobblestone 15th century streets for photos and such. Then, the sun set and it was time for the reception at the San Jose el Viejo which was elegantly lit with candles.'
p29
aS'Believe me, this Destination wedding at San Jose el Viego in Antigua, Gutemala wedding was as awesome as it sounds! Chris and Kamille, it was so much fun and thank for putting up with Katie and I s exuberance in photo/video taking. It was so wonderful getting to know you both and we look forward to seeing you guys again in the future.'

aS'From the Bride  Nick and I had been together for over four years when he proposed to me during a family holiday on Hamilton Island. He d been planning it for many months and was hoping to propose on one of the beautiful white beaches on the island, but it had been raining for days on end, so Nick went down on one knee when we had a moment to ourselves in the kitchen of the apartment we were staying in. It came as a complete surprise and once I got over the shock and understood that he was proposing I didn t hesitate to say yes. That afternoon the sun finally came out and we spent the rest of the holiday with our respective parents on an incredible high.'
p120
aS'When we returned home to Sydney we got lots of questions as to where we would get married. Nick is Australian and I am German so I thought it would be hard picking a location, but we both wanted to get married in Germany so we could incorporate some German traditions into our wedding. We had lived in London before moving to Sydney and both had friends all over the world that we were hoping would be able to be part of our big day. We had been told by so many friends that the day itself would pass in a blur, so we decided to have a whole week of celebrations in order to maximise the time with everyone. So on top of the wedding we organised a Germany v Australia soccer match between our friends, a traditional German Polterabend as well as pre-wedding drinks the night before the wedding. That week we spent with our closest friends and family, eating and drinking, celebrating and laughing, we feel incredibly blessed to have had that extended time together.'
p121
aS'Since Nick is a graphic designer and I m an event manager we knew we wanted to do a lot of the planning and organisation for the big day ourselves. We both had a pretty clear idea what our wedding should be like. We wanted it to be a day to celebrate our love with our closest family and friends, a fun day with good food, good wine and good music. Trying to find the venue from Sydney was the hardest thing of all. My family in Germany were very supportive and went to have a look at venues we liked for us, however none fit our requirements. We wanted somewhere contemporary but with character, somewhere that was cosy and also had an outside area. Finally, one day I found a restaurant online that seemed to tick all the boxes. It was an old converted warehouse with wooden beams, white washed walls, long tables with mismatched chairs, an outside area with big beach chairs and a waterfall. In short, it looked perfect. So my sister and parents went to have a look at it for us. They loved it as much as we loved the pictures and so we booked the venue without having seen it ourselves. I also found our ceremony venue online, a small, 13th century church located on the river Elbe in Dresden, tucked away on the outskirts of Dresden. Sadly the church got badly damaged during a flood just six weeks before the wedding. We were incredibly lucky and managed to find another gorgeous church not too far from our reception venue just four weeks before the wedding. Seeing both the church and the reception venue in person when we arrived in Germany was a big relief. Both venues looked better in reality than on the photos.'
p122
aS'I found a lot of inspiration on wedding blogs, as well as Pinterest. Our colour scheme was blush and grey, so from the bridesmaids dresses, the groomsmen outfits, the flowers to the decorations we incorporated those colours everywhere. Nick designed the save the date cards, the invitations, the menus and ceremony booklets. He also made the signs and the table numbers from materials I ordered online. I stamped the name tags and together with our friends we filled the favour bags with sweets. I had sent the restaurant an inspiration board with table and ceiling decorations and they did an absolutely amazing job with it all. We couldn t have been happier.'
p123
aS'Our wedding day was more than we could have ever hoped for. Of course the day went in a blur, from getting ready with our bridesmaids and groomsmen in the morning, to the ceremony which was officiated by the priest that had married my parents, to the beautiful and funny speeches and the late night dancing, but the memories will stay with us forever. We wouldn t change a thing. We are so incredibly thankful to our friends and family who travelled from all corners of the world to celebrate with us.'

S'Living in England seems pretty amazing. But living in England and packing up for a week long wedding at a French Chateau   even better. Captured by WOOKIE, along with romantic garden florals by Fleurs De Famille and planning by the bride herself, this destination wedding will surely have you dreaming of gorgeous French nuptials that look just like this.'
p150
aS'Charlotte & Grant were married in South West France. They are both English, and the whole wedding party & guests made their way over to the Dordogne for almost a week of wedding festivities!'
p151
aS'The couple had a whole itinerary laid out over the holiday, with everyone partaking in wine tastings, canoeing, picnics on the river and various other excursions before and after the wedding day.'
p152
aS'On the morning of the wedding, most of the guests were running around decorating and setting up, whilst the local florist and catering company also did their part. It was quite fun for the bride to watch down from her turret window and see everything coming together! After a leisurely few hours getting ready, the time came for the bridesmaids to put on their dresses. Unfortunately, somewhere in transit, one of them had gone missing. Luckily though, the bride was completely chilled and it turned out to be the only hiccup throughout the whole day- quite lucky considering they organized the wedding and dragged most of it over from the UK!'
p153
aS'The bride wore a beautiful Belle & Bunty gown, and a real flower crown in her hair. The Groom had bespoke suits made for himself and his ushers from Reiss, complete with matching socks, ties and shoes.'
p154
aS'Their ceremony was outside (luckily the weather on the day was perfect, despite it raining the day before AND after) under a beautiful arbor of flowers. After readings from family and the signing of the register, they cut a ribbon (a French tradition) and walked to the other side of the chateau for champagne and canap s, with a minstrel quartet.'
p155
aS'A few hours later everyone made their way to the barn for speeches and the wedding breakfast. Later on, guests mingled in the twilight as the bride threw her bouquet from a balcony, and played around with a makeshift photo booth. As night fell, everyone made a walkway to the barn with sparklers, and the bride and groom made their way into the barn for the first dance. The band played into the small hours, and most people danced all night whilst a few snuck off into the chateau to play the piano and carry on the merriment!\n'

So every time a wedding comes around in this locale, I wonder what I m waiting for. And when it s as gorgeous as this one from Adam Alex and White Avenue? You can bet I ll be stuck in the gallery for days!'
p208
aS'From White Avenue  This was a wedding where two cultures came together, where two families travelled from far and wide to be at Jessie & Daniel s wedding on the island of paradise, Mykonos.'
p209
aS'Jessie and Daniel both live in London but Jessie s family is Malaysian and Daniel s are from Ukraine. You might wonder then why they married in Mykonos? They fell in love with the island when they travelled there on holiday a year before. It was also a place where their families could relax for a whole week as opposed to just one or two days in a busy city. Mykonos is a beautiful island with lots to see and do, fresh food to eat. It oozes authenticity and culture despite it being a place where thousands of people flock to every year.'
p210
aS'There are wonderful images of the couple getting ready and preparing for the day ahead with their bridesmaids and ushers surrounding them. The ceremony would take place in a beautiful chapel courtyard with stunning views of the sea. The luxury resort they were staying at was quite secluded from the rest of the island and sits way up on the edge of a hill.'
p211
aS'As guests eagerly waited for the bride and her father walk down the aisle, there was a sense of excitement as the bridesmaids and maid of honour made their way down the steps from behind them. Then followed beautiful Jessie and her father. It really was a wonderful entrance!'
p212
aS'We actually scheduled the ceremony relatively early for a wedding in Greece. It is so hot, even at 6pm so it is best to start an outdoor ceremony when the sun is going down. On this occasion it was scheduled an hour or so before sunset because there would be a jam-packed wedding reception ahead. As Daniel s family were from Ukraine, they loved the Russian wedding style where lots would be going on, such as games and long speeches made by many of the family members. One particular game involved Jessie and Daniel sitting in the centre of the dance floor with their backs facing each other. A question like  Who is the most argumentative?  would be asked and they would have to hold up an object that represented Jessie or Daniel. It really was a fun wedding with lots of laughing and lots of entertainment.'
p213
aS'The style of the wedding involved a lot of golds, pinks and creams, and a lot of candlelight for a beautiful ambiance when it got dark. The most important thing for Jessie & Daniel was that their guests had great food, especially fresh seafood, a brilliant party'
p214
aS'During the dinner, the band played some mellow jazz and then for the party, Jessie and Daniel wanted to party in Greek style  plate smashing and Greek dancing. Towards the end of the night, in true Mykonos style, the party music kicked in via a DJ. The night ended with the guests standing on the terrace overlooking the stunning views and witnessing fantastic fireworks.\n'

S'To wed at the Eiffel Tower, in a romantic rain shower, with the sweetest flower girl you ever did see  does it get any more romantic than that? With Rendez-vous in Paris behind the planning and Timepiece Studio snapping up all the lovely details, we re left with a gallery filled to the brim with Parisian whimsy and romance.'

aS'From Timepiece Studio  A Rainy Night in Paris. The romance, the puddles, the champagne, the macaroons! Add all this together, along with the cutest flower girl in ever & I d say you have a fairytale wedding in Paris.'
p272
aS'At 4:00 o clock, this photographer bride and writer groom met at the Eiffle Tower, just on the east side of the Champs de Mars at the end of  rue du Mar chal Harpiste  with their dear friends & family to make things official. As luck would have it, the rain started coming down almost the exact moment that Devina (the bride) stepped out of the Parisian Cab. That didn t matter for a second though, clear umbrellas with their initials were passed out to the guests and as the gorgeous bride accompanied by her equally gorgeous 7-year-old daughter danced down the grassy aisle, the world was perfect, rain drops and all. The spirit of their flower girl stole the show in her etsy-bought dress that she chose all her own. '

It s the kind of thing that happens when the amazing Jessica Sloane just so happens to be your sister, and sets out to plan the prettiest beach affair you ever did see.

aS'From Jessica Sloane  When my sister got engaged, I knew it was going to be something! To my surprise, she wanted to get married with a small group of people on the beach. Since she and her fiance are both teachers, they needed to plan a summer wedding around their time off. So we had six months to pull together a destination wedding on a beach we had never been to, but with the help of some great vendors, the day came together seamlessly!'
p314
aS'Jenni and Brandon wanted the day to be casual, relaxed and intimate. So with about 30 close friends and family, they said their vows barefoot in the sand. The celebration, at a private residence, was the perfect  pool party  complete with a plated dinner, a bushwhacker toast and dancing.\n'

S'This Mexico destination affair is the kind of wedding that deserves to be swooned with a cocktail in hand. A margarita on the rocks, to be be specific. Because when you ve got images as beautiful as Emily Blake s and glam-filled moments designed by Mishka Designs and Planner 1 Events, there s just no telling how long a trip to the gorgeous gallery will last. Get started here!'
p357
aS'From the Bride  Sean & I value our time with our friends and family above all, so our top priority was finding a big house near the water where we could gather for several days before and after the actual wedding celebration. We both love Mexico, so we narrowed our search to the Caribbean side (equidistance from our families on the West and East coasts) and went in search of a venue that would set the stage for the multi-day wedding celebration we envisioned.'
p358
aS'Although we knew the elements that inspired us, we needed help putting it all together. That is where Mishka Designs came into play. The first time we met Mishka in Mexico, we both breathed a sigh of relief and knew we wanted her on our team. She coordinated site visits for us and helped us find our dream venue in Puerto Aventuras.'
p359
aS'The Haciendas  gorgeous architecture and decor definitely inspired us. We envisioned a romantic, nature-inspired, elegant, Old World wedding there. Hacienda Del Mar s courtyard provided the soulful space we sought for our ceremony. The tree-lined walkway made a stunning natural aisle. The Caribbean Sea was elegantly framed by the arched portals. We fell in love with the place and couldn t wait to bring our friends and family there.'
p360
aS'We chose ivory, poppy red and Mexican pink as our primary colors and used soft blush and peach to create a natural, romantic feel. We accented with gold metallics and lace details. The bridal party wore rich shades of charcoal which contrasted beautifully with the ivories, greens and vibrant colors of Mexico. We wanted to bring natural elements into the courtyards, so florals and greenery were our priority in the design process. Colorful Bougainvillea surrounded the guest seating area. Gabi of Planner One Events blew us away with her exquisite arch and romantic floral centerpieces.'
p361
aS'I agree with the advice other brides have given: enjoy the day above all else. For us, that meant having a professional team. We saw our wedding reception as an opportunity to throw a great party for our guests one that would require help to pull off. We knew we wanted to be  hands on  in planning, but we wanted to be able to let go once the wedding day arrived. So, my advice is to hire a team of people you like and trust. Not only was Mishka s design exactly like we imagined, but she became our friend and supported us the whole way. Neither she nor the LM Wedding team balked at any request. We feel so blessed to have found Mishka Designs, the amazingly talented Emily Blake, hairstylist Kristen McNulty, and our coordinator, LM Weddings, who made planning a wedding 4,000 miles away a breeze.'
p362
aS'One of our highlights from the day was right after the ceremony. While our guests made their way to the cocktail reception, Sean and I stole a minute alone to enjoy our first sip of champagne as newlyweds. We entered the reception alongside our Mariachi band as they burst out an impressive version of Johnny Cash s Ring of Fire. We felt exuberant and the sound of the horn playing could not have been a better fit for that moment.'
p363
aS'There were so many moments throughout the afternoon and evening when we locked eyes, held hands, kissed, and just breathed in the love all around us. We felt all the planning, everything had been executed exactly as we had hoped. But our biggest success was that our guests seemed to exude happiness and radiate love. We could truly feel the love in the air. Whenever we think back on it, we feel that rush of love and we see the smiling faces of our dearest friends and family. That, to us, made it the wedding day of our dreams.\n'

With Villa Marrakech as the Moroccan-inspired backdrop, beachy white blooms by Tropical Occasions and image upon pretty image from Margaux Photography, there s a whole gallery full of relaxed romance right here!'
p409
aS'From the Bride and Groom  Jared and I reside in Newport, Rhode Island with our 11 month old daughter, Emelia and our dog, Lucas. We LOVE living at the beach, going for hikes, drinking coffee, lazy Sunday mornings and cozying up with a good book. We are also lovers of travel and often retreat from our seaside sanctuary in New England for extended periods. It was during our first trip to Playa Langosta, Costa Rica when we fell madly and deeply in love with both the country and one another. Playa Langosta has since held a very special place in our hearts.'
p410
aS'We had hoped to find a Moroccan inspired villa to host our wedding at as this would best express our own personal style. Upon discovering Villa Marrakech we were beyond thrilled   it was the perfect location! Our wedding was very intimate with just our closest family and friends in attendance. This allowed for a wonderfully relaxed and romantic atmosphere.'
p411
aS'We began the morning with a group yoga class at Villa Marrakech. This was the perfect way to start our big day! Later, our guests joined us on the beach for our unique Buddhist inspired ceremony just before sunset. Our ceremony was very special to the two of us as it included a number of Buddhist prayers, a hand-washing ritual, our exchange of personal vows, exchange of rings (Jared s ring was designed and made by his dad!), etc.'

aS'Following an amazing dinner, we enjoyed a spectacular show put on by a group of fire dancers. The night ended with the bride, groom and all guests jumping in the pool   wedding gown and all!\n'

S'If you haven t noticed, we re suckers for a pretty pair of heels and we ve got a whole gallery full of them (thousands, actually!) to prove it. So when we heard that this stunning bride wore not one, but three pairs of shoes on her wedding day, designed by her own father AND brand-named after her? Well, you can imagine our excitement. There s even more to swoon over from the amazing Brancoprata.'
p428
aS'From Brancoprata  Belinda has always been the kind of girl whose dreams had nothing to do with getting married! She always told her family and friends that she would never marry. Until the day she found herself hopelessly in love with her longtime friend, Pedro! They were best friends even before they started dating and shared everything with each other! It was undoubtedly a love that began in a true and very strong friendship! Maybe that s why the motto of their marriage was  Today I married my best friend  or if you want, in Portuguese  Hoje casei com o meu melhor amigo . Once Belinda and Pedro decided to marry , Belinda realized it was more enthusiastic about the subject marriage than what she initially thought. She was also very surprised when she realized that the colors she wanted for their wedding were blush pink and silver  quite girly and romantic, right?'
p429
aS'A curious thing about this wedding was without any doubt the three  yes, three pairs of shoes that the bride wore, all from the same shoe brand, the one her father created with her own name, Belinda. How cool is that? Also she wore two different dresses, a Pronovias gown for the religious ceremony and dinner and a beautiful Karen Millen for the party!'
p430
aS'At midnight they all sang  Happy Birthday  to Belinda s goddaughter as she turned eighteen and afterwords they danced for the first time as husband and wife and didn t stop dancing until dawn. Belinda and Pedro enjoyed their wedding day always with a smile on their faces and neither the fog or bad weather managed to get those smiles off their faces!\n'

It s a floral heaven (looking at you Philippa Craddock!) with bohemian details to die for and quite possibly one of the prettiest cakes I ve ever seen from Cakes By Krishanthi. Did I mention there are sandals made of flowers and a floral tattoo involved? If you can believe it, there s even more in the gallery!'
p458
aS'From photographer, Anush  Low  The venue for the shoot was the intimate and stylish Clifton Nurseries Garden Centre & Plant Nursery in Maida Vale, London. The organic-inspired table setting included a green foliage and flora table runner with blackberries, figs, red grapes and artichokes. We had a stunning cascading bouquet with delicate ferns and a pretty natural flower crown. Our talented florist, Philippa Craddock, also made a unique fresh flower bridal  sandals  using flowers and berries, and she used fresh flowers were woven into a full-length bridal veil. A beautiful botanical tattoo adorned the back of one of our models. The dresses continued the floral theme with delicate laces, embroidery and flowing bohemian full-length skirts. We had a second table outdoors in the gazebo with fruit-filled hanging glass bauble-vases and gorgeous floral chair-back mini-bouquets. Old-school Botanical prints taped to a blackboard, a botanical ladder display with flowers, fruit and several more pretty details as well.\n'

Its one of our favourite places on earth and there wasn t anywhere else we considered when it came to planning our wedding. We really wanted to avoid having a  predictable  wedding, so tried to put lots of personal touches into the day to make it as memorable for our guests as it was for us. As it turned out, the wedding exceeded even our own expectations   pretty much all of our special people made a weekend out of it, and the incredible Deliciously Sorted made sure that every request, no matter how tiny or big, was fulfilled and stress free. We opted to get married at a stunning villa, overlooking the sea, so that our friends and family could bring their children and know that everyone was safe and in one place. It was perfect for the relaxed day that we d envisaged and the memories make us wish we could do it all over again!\n'

S'I knew I was going to love this wedding with all my being when I laid eyes on the images from Ines DiSanto, but then I read the Bride s story and I fell head over heels. That s when I realized my words could never possibly do this wedding justice. Their story will pull at your heart strings and then make you smile from ear to ear (the Groom did his Bride s wedding day hair!), so it goes without saying this gallery is one worthy of your entire weekend.'
p511
aS'From the Bride Our story has been a lifetime in the making. I was only ten years old when I met the boy I would one day marry. We were brought together under trying circumstances when both of our fathers had passed away. Tom and I were introduced on a particularly painful day during a funeral, but were still able to find comfort, strength, and love in each other. Since that bittersweet day in our childhood, we have experienced so many beautiful things and our relationship has flourished. We truly believe that our meeting was fate, perhaps arranged by our loved ones above. After fifteen years together, we are so happy to finally be married.'
p512
aS'We genuinely wanted to capture this feeling of innocence and enchantment on our wedding day. Our hope was that the occasion would be an enjoyable and unforgettable experience for our intimate group of guests. And in order to satisfy our wanderlust and honor our European heritage, we knew we wanted to say,  I do  abroad. The result was a destination celebration in a small town in Normandy, France.'
p513
aS'We planned every detail, large and small, ourselves. I was lucky enough to know enough French vocabulary in order to communicate with vendors and make arrangements. My sister-in-law picked flowers and made the boutonnieres. My mother organized the flower arrangements and set the table. And my talented husband not only hand carved a beautiful wooden box to hold our vows, but he also did my hair the morning of the wedding day! And of course choosing our reception venue, which also doubled as our accommodations for the week-long celebration, was an easy decision to make because the historical ch teau and grounds were absolutely stunning.'
p514
aS'However, I must admit that our wedding would not have been possible without all of the wonderful locals who helped us tremendously. To our luck, we found an incredibly generous priest who agreed to marry us in a striking 12th-century church. Not only did our priest give us a wonderful ceremony, but he also revealed to us that he had decorated the church especially for us, admitting his other passion besides his spiritual work of course, included interior design. A friend and local hotel owner lent us his common area for cocktail hour and provided delicious treats ranging from champagne to macaroons. And besides the decorations and extraordinary food supplied by our amazing caterers from Honfleur Traiteur, all of the flowers, the wedding cake, and other small touches were provided from the local shops in the area. Also worth mentioning is our incredible photography team, Lmvisual, who truly captured every treasured detail of the entire event and perfectly portrayed the beauty of the area. It was honestly touching to see how much the whole town cared about our special day and their hospitality and generosity were tremendous. My advice to other couples planning a destination wedding would be to simply be nice and respectful to the people you seek help from because kindness is usually rewarded.'
p515
aS'Our wedding completely exceeded my expectations and I will remember it as the happiest time of my life. But most of all, I will remember the feeling of love shared by all, which truly took on an energy of its own. And as our mothers like to say, our fathers shared in our special day because on the morning of our wedding day, the warm sun broke through the notorious rain clouds of Normandy and the wild flowers on the property bloomed overnight.\n'

It beautifully infuses tradition with gorgeous style   so don t be surprised when every image captured by One and Only Paris Photography sitting in this gallery leaves you completely speechless.'
p631
aS'From One and Only Paris Photography Provence is a magical part of France with stunning landscapes and amazing light. It is the perfect backdrop for a wedding. Christina and Paul came all the way from the US to get married here surrounded by friends and family. Music was a huge part of their day and everybody partied late into the night under the stars.'
p632
aS'Christina is half American, half French and Paul is Canadian. They both love art and it is thus quite naturally that they decided to seal their union in Aix en Provence, the city of the talented Paul C zanne. The day before, a rehearsal dinner was held at an amazing venue dedicated to painting. It was as beautiful as the wedding.'
p633
aS' Each detail of this wedding was important; from the Provencal cooking to the decoration. Christina knew exactly what style she wanted for her wedding decoration. She wanted something elegant with a touch of Provence. As color scheme, she chose coral to match her Valentino shoes and bridesmaids dresses.'
p634
aS'The ceremony was held in front of the ancient church of the chateau. The cocktail took place poolside amidst the ancient stone ruins. Following the cocktail hour, guests made their way into the marquee for dinner, collecting their escort card from drawers filled of dry lavender.'
p635
aS'This romantic wedding in France was a soft day under the warm light of Provence. A lot of this wedding was about sharing Provence lifestyle with their friends and family coming from all around the world.\n'

S'As if your Spring Fever weren t at an all time high after the winter we ve had, we re throwing a beautiful garden wedding your way, and the bride is wearing a dress made of flowers (!!!) from Zita Elze. Believe me when I say you re not going to want to miss a minute of this beautiful gallery from Mister Phill, and as a sweet treat for you, we ll be back later today with a closer look at that beautiful gown!'
p690
aS'From Mister Phill  Leanne & Ben s English Summer wedding day traversed and encompassed rustic natural charm combined with old Hollywood style elegance and modern twists that made their day truly their own, truly one to remember; a day rich in fantastic design from beginning to end and populated by fantastic people.'
p691
aS'The visual show-stopper of the wedding, it must be said, was Leanne s breathtaking first wedding dress of the day   yes, she had two dresses   an astounding fresh flower and berry bodice combined with a flowing train made of Stipa grass, designed by Zita Elze. Worn by Leanne for the ceremony at St. Michael s Church in Betchworth, Surrey, the dress was a complete surprise for all of the assembled guests and represented the first ever occasion on which a bride had worn one of Zita s creations on her wedding day.'
p692
aS'As Ben awaited his bride at the end of an aisle arrayed down each side with tea lights, pots of straw-light Stipa and dark green grasses interspersed with daisies (all arranged by Zita), and adorned with hand cut paper butterflies by Florrie Ann Thomas, Leanne entered the church through an entrance arched with grasses and flowers designed to echo her dress, accompanied by rustic wooden hearts and dangling bottled flowers. The wedding rings too were delivered on a wooden heart to match!'
p693
aS'Ben wore a grey Armani suit and he and his groomsmen sported boutonni re designed to match Leanne s bodice. Leanne s bridesmaids wore slate gowns from Twobirds and held bouquets of yellow Aram lilies and Stipa grass.'
p694
aS'After the ceremony, the newly-weds joined their guests at Leanne s family home for the reception. An architecturally stunning stretch tent supplied by The Stretch Tent Company accommodated the wedding breakfast and evening party, providing shade from the English summer heat whilst capturing cool breezes through its open sides (it also served well in keeping everyone sheltered from a passing British summer storm!)'
p695
aS'The tent was decorated with a clean, modern air to it, crisp white linens accompanied by silver dinnerware, adorned with tealights, flowers and bunches of gooseberries on the top table to extend and interweave the natural organic flavor of the afternoon s ceremony into the evening s celebrations. The open sided construction of the tent allowed the party to extend into the family garden where guests could relax on beanbags and in rattan chairs.'
p696
aS'Between ceremony and reception, Leanne changed into her second dress of the day, an utterly stunning, figure hugging Old Hollywood style Pronovias gown. Ben s expression of amazement and admiration, as he watched Leanne descend the stairs in this second outfit, was priceless!'
p697
aS'The meal served at the wedding breakfast was of Leanne & Ben s design, centered around a particular shared enjoyment of eating at Nandos. The culinary theme was commensurately interpreted, created and delivered by Purple Grape Catering. Baked beans with toasted soldiers, fish fingers with tartar sauce and macaroni and cheese pots served as appetizers and were followed by chicken breast marinated in Peri-Peri sauce and accompanied by chips, crunchy coleslaw, spicy rice and macho peas for the main course (with a vegetarian option of grilled Halloumi and mushrooms). The main course elements were delivered in large bowls to each table to enhance the sharing experience of the day. A lottery ticket was placed in a teacup for each guest to chance their fortune that weekend. Chocolate and raspberry pots, Eton Mess, Cr me Br l e topped with popping candy, Tiramisu and chilled rice pudding topped with fresh fruit compote were offered on a specially set aside table as a dessert selection for each guest to choose which took their fancy.'
p698
aS'A beautiful wedding cake by Ceri Olfoson was designed to complement in style Leanne s first wedding dress of the day.'
p699
aS'The day was topped off with a resounding evening party that saw guests dancing into the night.\n'

S'A destination wedding in Seville sounds like a dream, no? Now how about a two day wedding extravaganza filled with faux-bull fighting, a moroccan picnic cocktail hour and beautiful al fresco dining under a Spanish moon   it s wildly beautiful and all caught on film by Leila Brewster along with the perfect film captured by Elysium Productions. Have a look!'
p722
aS'This wedding in Seville, Spain had it all. Bull (toros in spanish!)? check. Gypsy wedding complete with kidnap of the bride?  check. Gorgeous Spanish/Morroccan designed reception in an old olive orchard estate? Check.'
p723
aS'Mara & Seb couldn t think of anywhere better to tie the knot than Seville, Spain where the bride spent many holidays growing up in their family vacation home. And if you are going to have a wedding in such a place steeped in tradition, might as well go all out!'
p724
aS'The rehearsal dinner was not so much a dinner as a traditional outing to the local bull fight ring. However there was one major difference. The matadors featured were actually several members of the wedding party! These brave gentleman (and women) barely escaped being wounded by a (not so big) bull and all the guests had a great time cheering them on.'
p725
aS'Later, guests watched Mara & Seb take part in a traditional gypsy wedding. (The gypsy culture is alive and well in this part of the world). Of course what would a gypsy wedding be without a kidnap and bribery?'
p726
aS'The wedding day was another day full of tradition. Mara wore a beautiful Spanish inspired gown and was topped off by a traditional Spanish head piece. Seb wore a custom suit by Bonobos. The couple did their first look on the top of Hotel Alfonso XIII which had a gorgeous view of the city. From there, the couple rode in a vintage motorcycle (Sidecar) to the Alcazar where they got special permission to shoot some incredible portrait photos!'
p727
aS'A bit later It was off to the Iglesia del San Jorge de La Caridad. A gorgeous 15th century church in the middle of Seville where the real ceremony took place. We loved the bridesmaids dresses. All unique and chosen by the gorgeous ladies.'
p728
aS'Now the reception takes the cake. Have you seen a more gorgeous setting in your life? Hacienda Molinillos is an old olive mill complete with a fantastic landscape and greenery that would make any guest drop their jaw. On top of that, Mara did an incredible job planning all the details involved from the signs to the morroccan lamps and blankets adorning the cocktail area. The guests had a gourmet (and traditional of course) dinner under the stars and then moved on to another designed area for the party. We can honestly say that this is one wedding that will never be forgotten!!\n'

And the images below and sitting in this gallery of this sweet Hawaiian elopement at the Four Seasons Resort are the perfect examples of why. See them all here.'
p744
aS'This sweet couple traveled all the way from the East Coast for a special elopement on the island of Lanai. Lanai is a private island and the Four Seasons have two resorts there.. Manele Bay is on the beach. Shelby and Justin were excited for their wedding and had a perfect day. They got ready in their rooms then met in the garden for a first look. Then we headed down to the beach on a very calm late afternoon for their sunset ceremony. The whole time during the ceremony, there was a pod of dolphins playing and jumping just off shore. Im not sure the couple noticed they were so busy looking into each other s eyes but it was very special and not something that happens every day. After the ceremony, the couple headed up to an oceanfront cabana for a candlelit dinner and champagne.\n'

And while this bride layered on the turquoise and coral touches   inspired from the beaches themselves   the backdrop alone was enough for us to fall in love. Even more photos from Crown Images right here!'
p771
aS'From the bride We were going for a vintagey-beachy, relaxed elegance kind of vibe. We went with a lot of turquoise blue (bridesmaid dresses, mason jars for the ceremony aisle & the centerpieces, mother of the bride dress & turquoise gingham cocktail umbrellas I got from France) and coral (my shoes, troy s socks & tie, the flowers, the ringbearers ties, the flower girls flower crowns, cocktail straws, matchbooks, the lace & burlap table runners and really pale peachy flowers on my dress). Basically, I went crazy on etsy. I actually didn t realize how vintage-y my dress and hair looked until I saw your pictures. I loved how it all came together! It was a last minute to decision to have the flower girls & ringbearers barefoot for the wedding. I loved the kids playing in the water during & right after the wedding.'
p772
aS'Music is also really important to me so that s why we had the guitar player for the wedding (I walked down the aisle to  Lovely Day  by Bill Withers). We also had a steal drum player for the cocktail hour & dj for the reception. Our wedding song was  I Got You  by Jack Johnson.'
p773
aS'Since my guests were coming a long way & using up vacation time to come to my wedding, I wanted them to have as great a time as possible. So that s why we also had a welcome party the night before and a beach party the day after the wedding. Lots of great food & great drinks by Passion Fruit caterers for all 3 events.'

S'Beach parties are fun, but beach weddings, now those are amazing. And this Italian version captured by  Maison Pestea takes the easy beauty of the beach, mixes it with a gorgeous all white cocktail party, hydrangeas for days by Tea Rose and lots of cozy conversation spots in the sand. Thus making this one beach party wedding we can so get behind. Have a look here for even more.'
p827
aS'From the Photographer  This wedding was a beautiful sunset ceremony on the beach in the south of Rome with a reception held at a private home on the beach in Sabaudia.'
p828
aS'All guests wore white, with the bride, a former ballerina, in a very pale blue dress. Large floral arrangements in shades of blue were layered throughout the affair. Guests enjoyed cocktails on the sand where shoes were optional and as a little treat, each guest was given a pair of white Havanas.'

aS'After dinner, the party continued on the beach with music and dancing and a late night candy bar, Italian style.\n'

S' Epitomizes English glamour and elegance  is guaranteed to pull me in every single time, and this time, I was floored. Blown away by the beauty that is this wedding from Anushe Low. The shoes, the gown, that warm, beautiful light, it s like someone bottled up my dreams and gave me the best present ever  in the form of a highlight film from reellovefilms!'
p903
aS'From Reellovefilms  Well, what a wedding this was! Wall to wall beautiful  Susie and Stuart were married at the elegant and lovely Brocket Hall, UK, and it was clear right from the start that they had made a huge effort on their wedding .it looked completely amazing. Everything from the flowers by Jamie Aston, Susie s Jenny Packham dress and Jimmy Choo shoes and Stuarts dapper Stuart Lamprell suit had been chosen to compliment the elegant, timeless and beautiful surroundings it really was a good looking day! Brocket Hall epitomises English glamour and elegance; frescos on the ceilings, gilded details, lawns and lakes serene.'
p904
aS'Susie had an amazing team getting her get ready, not that she needs much help with Severin Hubert on hair and Sarah Brock on make up, and what a job they did. Lots of music accompanied the day with the amazing Steve Christie on Piano and the equally amazing Matt Maurice kicking the evening party off .complete with Xylobands!'
p905
aS'As well as this wedding just looking so beautiful, there was more to it than that Stuart and Susie are an incredibly warm, happy, fun, caring and genuine couple, who made our job filming them so easy on the day. They were surrounded by so many people who thought the world of them and you could just feel the happiness on the day. This is what made the wedding truly a great one we loved every minute and wish you both so much happiness in your future together xx\n'

S'You know what really gets my heart a beating? A simple, fuss-free yet wildly romantic elopement made for two. Just sand between your toes, ocean air in your lungs and the amazing Wendy Laurel by your side. It s exactly what these two Maui sweeties opted for, and if you ask me, it couldn t have turned out ANY better.'
p922
aS'From the Bride  Jason and I have been together for five years when I accepted a job in Santa Monica and he had one more semester to go in San Jose. We were in a long distance relationship from LA to SF and it was not easy! We visited each other almost every month and in February of this year, he proposed to me in Napa the day before my birthday. We were planning on a vacation to Maui this summer and jokingly talked about getting married there until we realized it was a perfect idea! We decided because it was six months away we were going to keep it an intimate and simple wedding, between just the two of us.'
p923
aS'A few things were necessary, a ceremony on the beach and an amazing photographer. After some time researching online, it was decided Makena Cove was just the place we envisioned and Wendy Laurel was the photographer we were looking for. Wedding planning was relatively easy from there, I found my dress the first day I started looking from BCBGMaxazaria and put together Jason s attire from Bloomingdale s. My sandals were by DolceVita.'
p924
aS'I m a DIY kind-of-person and decided I would make my own bouquet, using proteas, a common flower in Hawaii. I ordered flowers from Maui Floral and chose the other types of flowers when we arrived. The night before the wedding, Jason and I made the arrangement together. I did my own hair and makeup with a mimosa in hand that morning, while Facetiming with my mom. She bought me the beautiful necklace designed by Anna Beck. The entire experience felt like a dream, from our Hawaiian minister, Laki, singing to us while playing his ukulele to the gorgeous morning waves crashing into the cove, the ceremony could not have been anymore perfect!\n'

S'We ve touched on first and second part of this beautiful wedding weekend in Tuscany already today, but it s time for the Grande Finale. And oh, is it grand. Tuscan Villa, glittery bridesmaids, big and beautiful flowers, fireworks-grand. And we love every second. Italia Celebrations planned the whole weekend, which was captured brilliantly by both Magnus Bogucki and Cinemate, and it is the very definition of superb.'
p977
aS'From Italia Celebrations Wedding Planning  After two spectacularly fun and eventful days leading up to the wedding, this was the proverbial icing on the cake. The beauty of a destination wedding is that the wedding is usually not just one day but a series of days that make up the whole experience. Whereas the days prior were in turns rustic, historic, colorful and entertaining, the wedding day was stunning in its refinement and elegance.'
p978
aS'From the bride Meghan  After two previous days of spectacular scenery, d cor, events, and magical moments, Steven and I expected to wake up on our wedding morning and feel like we were prepping for another fantastic party. However, as the Il Borro villa began to come to life around 6 am, it quickly became clear that this day felt much more special.'
p979
aS'As I got ready in the bridal suite, overlooking so much beautiful Tuscan countryside, our wonderful videographers and photographer snapped away. We had multiple hair and make-up people, nail technicians, and wedding planners coming and going. It was a full room. We could hear the string quartet practicing below us, shrubs being moved into place and chairs being positioned.'
p980
aS'What can I say other than every clich  about walking down the aisle is completely true? I spent hours choosing d cor and music and fretting about flowers. However, when I turned the corner to walk into the ceremony all I saw was Steven standing there. I never saw a single flower or chair or the aisle runner I was walking on. All I cared about was finally being in that moment with him. That moment was what the wedding was all about.'
p981
aS'Sometimes people ask if I felt like a princess all day. I say, no, I felt like I was in a cloud. With the 18 ethereal layers of tulle and lace that made up my dress, the gentle Tuscan breeze, and all the white flowers, I just felt like I was floating in a happy, loving cloud all day.'
p982
aS'After the ceremony we went off to take photos in all the exquisite hidden places around Il Borro. The guests went to the villa garden for the cocktail hour. When we arrived back after the photo session, we were announced into the garden and led down the stairs; it was a moment I will never forget. All of our guests in the manicured Italian garden, in their tuxedos and beautiful dresses with the medieval village as a backdrop created a stunning seen   it was as if it had been pulled from my imagination and come to life.'
p983
aS'Dinner was held on the villa terrace with long tables filled with lush white flowers and candles decorating every inch. After dinner we cut our cake, had our first dance, watched fireworks, and I danced with my dad. This whole sequence was full of moments that were magical for us. When guests returned to their seats they were served mini wedding cakes that coordinated with our large wedding cake.'
p984
aS'Finally, when the DJ started playing  Tonight is Going to be a Good Night  by the Black Eyed Peas I was so excited to dance that I got up and ran to the dance floor. when I turned and looked back the tables were empty. Every guest had gotten up, ran with me, and had started dancing immediately. That s just how amazing our friends and family were and it took my breath away to see their excitement. Needless to say, we danced the night away and the party didn t slow down until around 3 a.m.'
p985
aS'To say it was the best three days of our lives is an understatement. Truthfully, I didn t know such happiness and amazing, joyful things existed before planning and having our wedding. We will never forget this time in our lives and will always cherish every moment as well as all the people who were there with us.'
p986
aS'The process was so amazing that I became a wedding planner myself along the way. Now I get to plan weddings for other couples in the U.K. (with my company Extraordinary Days). Thank goodness, because if I didn t have more weddings to look forward to I don t know what I would do!'
p987
aS'All of the people that we worked with on our wedding were amazing. Our wedding planner, Brenda Babcock of Italia Celebrations made every dream Steven and I had come true. Noosheen Flowers gave us flowers more beautiful than I ever imagined. Cinemate created a wedding video we will treasure forever. Magnus Bogucki, our photographer created photos we will never get tired of looking at (and showing people!). Paper Moss and Ceci New York gave me an obsession with fabulous stationery and a joy of design rounds. Asprey designed our rings which we will love all of our life. Then, of course, last but certainly not at all least, Vera Wang Chicago gave me a lifetime experience at a bridal boutique I wish every bride could have as well as my dream dress. Every one of these businesses is made up of kind and passionate people you would want to entrust your wedding to. Thank you all.\n'

With Yes, I Do behind the planning, I knew I d love it, but after watching the intimate emotions captured so well by FOCUSLAB, I m floored, and quite honestly, wiping tears from my eyes.'
p1003
aS'From FOCUSLAB  Alex and David have lived a lifetime separated just by some blocks in their city, New York, going to the same parties, same restaurants, with some common friends, but without running into each other, but as in all great stories there is something unexpected happened, they met in Spain and this country became important in their story, so they decided to get married there. Alex and David were preparing a wedding that reflected their day-to-day: full of details, stylish and a big celebration for their friends, who have traveled from the States (and all over the world) to be with them. The trip is an important point in their history so they decided to give their guests a unique experience of traveling and visiting a new city.'

S'If I could roll everything I love into one perfect post, it would look exactly like this. It s what happens when two madly in love sweethearts throw caution to the wind and elope in the City of Lights with Caroline Yoon by their side. And if a morning (virtual) escape to Paris sounds equally as enticing, you can join me right here.'
p1055
aS'From the Bride  When Christian and I began planning our wedding, we knew we wanted our day to be simple, intimate and meaningful. Even still, I found myself burdened by the social expectations and conventions that come along with throwing a traditional wedding. At one point, I turned to Christian and said,  I wish we could elope to Paris.  His immediate response was,  Why can t we? Let s do it.  I was so touched by his openness and sense of adventure that, for the first time, I began to think that the wedding day we dreamed of was possible.'
p1056
aS'From there, everything fell into place in a serendipitous way. Choosing a dress became surprisingly easy. I eschewed traditional ball gowns as impractical for winter in Paris and instead selected a silk column gown that truly spoke to me with its sculpted clean lines and sense of restrained elegance. When the American Church in Paris told us that it was only available for the exact date and time that we were hoping for, we knew it was fate.'
p1057
aS'Our wedding day was like the city of Paris itself: austere, lovely, and mysterious. After a simple Protestant ceremony at the American Church in Paris, Christian arranged for us to be picked up by a vintage Rolls Royce to tour the wintry streets of Paris. Our dinner reception was held at the incomparable Four Seasons. Being in a foreign country made it easier for us to entrust ourselves to the moment and allow our wedding day to unfold organically. Some of our loved ones also made their way to Paris to celebrate our moment   a gesture that I will always treasure. As Ernest Hemingway memorably wrote, Paris is a moveable feast and the city will stay with us forever.\n'

S'A few years ago I came across one of Andria Lindquist s beautiful images and I ve been a fan ever since. Enter: this Hawaiian destination wedding from Andria. My fan status was just elevated to a crazy level because this, my loves? This is seriously what the prettiest dreams are made of.'
p1074
aS'From the beautiful bride  When my fianc  and I first started planning we struggled with settling on a venue that was  just right  for us. Many of the venues in our home town of Seattle were beautiful, but they lacked the intimacy we were looking for. We came close to booking two different venues, but couldn t commit when it came time to sign the paperwork. With a little encouragement from our families, we settled on the one place that had been in front of us the entire time   Kauai.'
p1075
aS'My fianc  s family has been travelling to the Garden Isle for years, and we took our first trip there together two years prior. Not only did the location have special meaning to his family, but it was without a doubt the place where we first realized that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together.'
p1076
aS'Planning a destination wedding was a huge undertaking, but choosing our team of amazing vendors turned out to be my favorite part of the process. I could talk for ages about how amazing our vendors are and we were so lucky to have each one of them be a part of our day.'
p1077
aS'The most important part of our wedding was the photography. I researched hundreds of photographers before I found Andria Lindquist. When I saw her work, I was floored. After a few lively email exchanges I knew that I would sacrifice anything else in our budget to have her photograph our day. I m in awe of the way Andria s images tell beautiful stories and the way she captures emotion. Thanks to her we will be able to relive the story of our wedding day for years to come.'
p1078
aS'After choosing our photographer, everything else came together with ease. I love mid-century design and Hawaiian kitsch, so I was thrilled when I discovered that our favorite restaurant, the Hukilau Lanai, hosted weddings. My fianc  and I already knew that the food was amazing, but their grounds and banquet room were a perfect match for my style. Our on-site coordinator, Manda, and her staff exceeded our expectations and our wedding day went off without a hitch because of them.'
p1079
aS'Shipping d cor provided an extra challenge and I knew that what I sent had to make an impact. I opted to ship floating candle holders to turn up the romance in the venue, and paired them with bright centerpieces made from local flowers. I also designed all of our paper goods and used them as an extra way to add character to the ceremony and reception.'
p1080
aS'I loved our leis, centerpieces, and bouquets. My grandmother was not able to make the trip to the island, so to make sure that she was  with  me I had her favorite flower added to my bouquet. I loved our flowers so much that after the ceremony I placed them throughout our hotel room and kept them until they had completely wilted.'
p1081
aS'Our rehearsal was definitely an emotional high point. After the rehearsal, our officiant Kelvin Ho performed such a beautiful and intimate ring blessing, that it left our friends and families asking,  did you just get married?  The blessing reminded all of us why we were on the island, and grounded all of us for the big day ahead.'
p1082
aS'At the last minute we decided to hire a musician. Paul treated our guests to the sounds of traditional Hawaiian slack-key guitar before the ceremony and during cocktail hour, providing the perfect soundtrack for the afternoon.'
p1083
aS'Our food was off the charts. During our cocktail hour our guests enjoyed ahi poke nachos and ribs, and during the reception they had the choice of filet minion or the catch of the day. As expected our wedding reception was hot, but our DJ, Mike, kept the jams pumping and despite the heat, our guests danced until they were dripping with sweat.'
p1084
aS'Asking our friends and family to travel such a great distance for our wedding was a difficult choice, but by doing so, we were able to have the wedding we wanted the way we wanted.

S'There is a special smile that we reserve for the destination wedding. It s a little more relaxed, a little more happy, and with weddings like this one in Costa Rica from Four Nineteen Weddings and Artflower, can you blame us? Stories Wedding Photography has seriously taken the edge of this particular Tuesday and I d be willing to bet you ll be joining more than a few SMPers in the gallery today!'
p1130
aS'From Four Nineteen Weddings  Tracy & Jeff s decision to get married in Costa Rica seemed logical when they decided to have a destination wedding, as Jeff s family has businesses in Costa Rica. They wanted to have all their family and close friends join them for a super fun wedding weekend which culminated with their wedding at the gorgeous Playa Prieta Beach Club in Peninsula Papagayo.'
p1131
aS' I must say I loved this wedding! Tracy was super relaxed and allowed me and the awesome florists at Artflower to take over the design of the wedding provided we did two things: use purple flowers and go with a simple design that showcased the natural beauty of the venue, which is, quite possibly, one of the most beautiful beachfront venues in Costa Rica.'
p1132
aS' Even though the date they chose was at the end of the rainy season, and we could have had some rain, the weather was absolutely fantastic, and the beachfront ceremony under the trees was perfect, with the trees providing shade for the guests and an unparalleled view of the secluded Playa Prieta. They wanted a bit of decoration at the altar, and in her inspiration boards I saw a lot of capiz shell curtains, so we went a simple bamboo arch with fabric and flowers, and added some capiz shell strings. Mason jars with purple and green flowers were placed on the aisle chairs for a bit of extra decor without going over the top. Cocktails followed, and guests mingled in the beach club s cocktail bar and enjoyed the beach and the sunset (along with some delicious appetizers!). The reception was held by the pool, and we used the venue s natural wood top tables which added to the uncluttered feel that Tracy & Jeff wanted. The centrepieces, a mix of flowers and succulents in natural wood boxes, had some green added in to compliment the venue s place setting. Tracy was in charge of the cutest DIY elements, my favourite being the seating chart, which were seashells hand printed with the guests seating assignments, which we then placed on a bed of hydrangeas. She also made the table numbers (numbers painted on burlap) and printed the menus herself.'
p1133
aS' Another thing that was a must for this fun couple: they wanted guest to dance the night away. After dinner was done, the band came back with lots of latin music, and everyone was on the dance floor until it was time to head back to the hotel!\n'

S'Starting the week off with a gorgeous wedding in Spain sounds like a mighty fine idea, don t you agree? This beauty captured by Jimena Roquero Photography will surely start your week off on the finest of foots. It s romantic and rustic and all around lovely, and there is even more waiting for you right here.'
p1176
aS'From Jimena Roquero Photography Ruth & Javi knew what kind of wedding they wanted to have. They were sure they want their guests to enjoy a memorable evening and a party they will never forget. Since both of them are super busy professional engineers, they hired the amazing team of Bodas de Cuento to design and coordinate their wedding. When Wendy from Bodas de Cuento showed them the venue they have found for them they were in tears, that was just what they had dreamed of: Monte de Cutamilla, a rustic family house surrounded by mountains, where you can easily find horses and cows pasturing wildly!'
p1177
aS' They celebrated a beautiful outdoor ceremony and they spared some fresh lemonades at the end of it. They delivered fans and hats to the guests to fight the heat.The table setting and all the decoration was picked with enormous care and taste, and for the dance hour, they even gave their women guests some flip-flops to rest their feet from the high heels! Great idea!! They also gave them a cd with a music compilation with the favorite songs of the couple.\n'

S'Last spring, my sister was engaged in Italy  and ever since she promised forever on the Amalfi Coast, I ve been completely obsessed with visiting there.  Heightening my obsession ten-fold?  This breathtaking beauty of a day captured by Studio A+Q, which just so happens to be Italian perfection with sunny blue skies, stunning views and a bride and groom who are having a blast soaking it in.  See it all here.'
p1204
aS'From  the Bride  We always planned to have a small intimate wedding somewhere sunny, and following our engagement in Florence last year, Italy seemed like the obvious choice. After narrowing down our search to the Amalfi Coast region we visited a few venues and fell in love with the beautiful medieval watchtower-turned-restaurant Torre Normanna.'
p1205
aS'In particular we wanted to decide on our dream day then find a wedding planner to help make it happen, not choose a  package wedding  from their popular venues. I spent a long time searching Pinterest for inspiration, finding the perfect flowers and d cor which I then forwarded to our wedding planner.'
p1206
aS'Determined not to let a wedding abroad scupper any DIY plans, I got to work on light-weight projects which could be easily transported- bunting, napkin rings, order of service fans! The abundance of lemons on the Amalfi Coast meant we could also add little touches like a lemon-lined aisle, and limoncello favours at a relatively low cost. Keeping budget in mind I also overcame being unable to afford my dream Jenny Packham wedding dress by finding a local vintage dressmaker who designed and made my perfect dress for a fraction of the cost.'

Just have a look right here.'
p1289
aS'From the Photographer  Marie-Claire and Luke met over 4 years ago at a French language school in Paris. Luke hailed from Australia, while Marie-Claire came from Puerto Rico and the States. While the two learned to speak French, they fell in love. After falling in love, Marie-Claire, an obstetrics nurse, moved to Australia with Luke, an IT professional. Luke popped the question and they were faced with finding a location to celebrate their engagement and their wedding   a tricky task, since each of their families were in different hemispheres. But the answer soon became clear: France!'
p1290
aS'They celebrated their engagement first with a photo shoot in Paris.  Luke and I never got around to throwing a proper engagement party, so we decided that we would go all out with our engagement pictures.  To do just that, Marie-Claire asked her wedding photographer, Aneta Mak, and her wedding designer, Mary Lee Herrington of Mary Lee Herrington Celebrations, to help her put together an engagement shoot in Paris that captured  who we were as a couple and as individuals.  Marie-Claire has always loved classic films and grew up wistfully watching Rita Hayworth movies and old musicals. Luke is a self-professed Francophile, loving all things French. One of their favorite classics is Funny Face with Audrey Hepburn   a story about a bookworm who flies to Paris and is turned into a model. With the movie showcasing all the beautiful spots in Paris that Marie-Claire and Luke had grown to love, it was the perfect inspiration for a day in Paris celebrating their engagement.'
p1291
aS'Marie-Claire and Luke decided that, since their wedding was a significant trip for everyone (including themselves), they would make it as comfortable a stay as possible. They invited their closest friends and family to stay with them for a week at La Leotardie, a secluded property with open fields, forests, and wildlife. They exchanged vows at a historic church in the nearby village of St Georges de Monclard   Marie-Claire was escorted down the aisle by her brother. Her mother was her matron of honor. After the emotional Catholic ceremony, they celebrated back at La Leotardie with delicious local cuisine and dancing long into the night. Personal touches included a bespoke crescent moon photo booth, miniature clay sculptures of the pigeonniere as wedding favors (replicas of the pigeonniere at La Leotardie), a Puerto Rican wedding cake baked by the bride s brother and bridesmaid, a traditional French croquembouche, country-style tote bags made by the bride s aunt, and a letterpress bespoke stationery suite.\n'

See it all here.'
p1307
aS'From Ellie Gillard Sarah & Nigel are architects living in Australia, but originally from the UK and having lived in various different cities they finally decided on Chateau Rigaud in the Bordeaux countryside and surrounded by vineyards, for their wedding. Working so much with  new  things they loved that the Chateau had a patina of age: a sense that it had grown organically.'
p1308
aS'It was the perfect place for their wedding   close family and friends stayed for the whole weekend in the Chateau itself which was fully catered and with a fully stocked bar! They married under the old oak tree on the lawn before drinking Crementhe (the local Bordeaux champagne which came from a few miles away), eating local oysters and scallops and they danced together to THE hit of the summer   Get Lucky   as all of their friends and family sang along.'
p1309
aS'In terms of detail and styling, the Chateau itself handles flowers, styling and the food, and presents everything in keeping with its gorgeously rustic French aesthetic. Sarah had asked for local, natural flowers simply arranged, and this was throughout her bouquet, the flowers in and around the chateau and the table decorations. Travelling from Australia, they had to keep what they carried with them to a minimum, so they had simple place names and menu cards, with the cork place holders reflecting the wine heritage of the region whilst the venue provided silver teapots, mercury silvered tealight holders, a bakelite telephone and various chalkboards.\n'

aS'From the Bride  Baltic weather changes very fast. Bright sun showed up in the morning, but heavy rain started after, just at that moment when our guests arrived. But we were not upset about it at all! We met with friends at lunch time, and everyone participated in decorating the dinner hall, lounge-zone and guest-book place. Actually we brought a suitcase full of decorative elements. After lunch everyone changed to cocktail dresses and we arranged fun photo sessions with guests. Our bridesmaid wore colorful dresses and groomsmen wore color bow-ties. After dinner, we released sky lanterns. It was a touching moment! Later that night we had an informal party in a cocktail bar with fun dancing.\n'

S'It just so happens that I was in Ocho Rios almost 5 years ago on my honeymoon, so when I saw a destination wedding in Jamaica with Lauren Fair Photography on the agenda today, I had some pretty high expectations. And leave it to Lauren to completely blow them all out of the water. She captured the wedding (and the island) flawlessly and as luck would have it, it s all right here.'
p1374
aS'From the stunning bride  Kyle and I decided to have a destination wedding because it would ve been impossible to throw a fete as nice at home because the groom comes from a very large family. We knew right away that the most important aspects of our wedding were him and I. After perusing website after website, we came across Couples Tower Isle, a resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica with one very special feature  it s own private island. In addition, the resort was a hot spot for hollywood royalty in the 50 s and featured art deco styling and clean lines. It reminded us of our favorite hotel back home (The Chelsea in Atlantic City, NJ). I knew we had found our venue! We selected 10/4/13 as our wedding date, our dating anniversary was 4/10 so we felt it fitting. Working with the hotel staff was great, I received phone calls from the wedding manager multiple times in the weeks leading up to our arrival to iron out details and to assure me that everything was going to go off without a hitch!'
p1375
aS'We traveled to Jamaica and were joined by 26 friends and family members and 4 very talented vendors, Lauren & Tim of Lauren Fair Photography and Greg and Olivia of Willow Tree Films. Photography and videography is extremely important in a destination wedding since not everyone was able to travel with us. There was an itinerary for the weekend including rehearsal dinner on Thursday night, the wedding on Friday and a farewell sunset cruise on Saturday. The hotel catered to our group and surpassed every one of our expectations.'
p1376
aS'We started our Friday with a quick breakfast, then Kyle and most of the wedding guests went out on the early morning snorkeling trip while I relaxed on the beach for a bit. I think that s the best part of a destination wedding, I was laying on the beach the same day I said  I do . There was no stress, no pressure, everything was laid back and it felt amazing! I then headed off to the spa for my hair and makeup appointment. My mom came by a little later and Lauren and Olivia showed up to capture getting ready. After that, we met up with Greg and Tim and ate lunch at the buffet before getting into my dress. After changing into my dress, we set off to meet Kyle for our first look. I was on the verge of tears as I walked towards my groom, so happy that this day had finally come. We then took our formal pictures in the jungle in front of the resort and out on the beach before heading towards the private island.'
p1377
aS'Kyle and the guests were the first ride over to the island, I would be the last boat to go over. While the guests were on the island waiting for my arrival, the sky above the resort looked as if it might storm, but when I arrived on the island the skies cleared right up. I was given one of our signature cocktails when I got off the boat and a few minutes to sip before walking down the aisle. The music began and I started to head towards my groom. Tears immediately started falling down my face. I don t think there was a dry eye on the island. What an incredible moment to share with an intimate group of people. Kyle and I wrote our own vows, and tearfully recited them to each other, exchanged rings and the traditional  I Do s  and sealed it all with a kiss.'
p1378
aS'The sun was setting on the other end of the island so we raced toward it for some beautiful pictures. I didn t hesitate and jumped right in the water (only up to my knees) and Kyle needed some more coaxing, but eventually he joined in. I m so glad he did because those pictures are among our favorites!'
p1379
aS'Cocktail hour began immediately and flowed flawlessly into dinner and dancing. We were careful to include some traditional Jamaican wedding traditions. Our wedding cake was covered with a  veil  and our mothers lifted the veil to reveal our peach colored cake to our guests. After that, we fed each other pieces of cake from his lips to mine and back.'
p1380
aS'My favorite detail was my wedding bouquet which was placed inside of a conch shell. I had small and large white orchids with purple hydrangea interspersed. The conch shell made a wonderful souvenir since flowers cannot be brought back from Jamaica.\n'

S'An elegant Ibiza wedding with just a touch of Hollywood glamour sounds like what I need to be doing this weekend, but since that s not yet on my agenda, I think I ll spend some quality time soaking in this gorgeous affair captured by Gypsy Westwood Photography.  A breathtaking wedding in every which way, it s a stunning setting meets sweet pastel hues meets one seriously adorable family.  See it all here.'
p1397
aS'From Gypsy Westwood Photography  This wedding was all about the details. I know Emma had worked very hard on getting the perfect combination with the setting, venue, colours, dress, flowers, tables settings, favours, tags, drinks food (all of it really), not missing out her beautiful self, her son and, of course, husband-to-be!'
p1398
aS'The venue is actually a friend s house that is rented in the summer months and is just quite spectacular (the size of the pool,the view over Tagomago). It is called Las Nubes, which it is, in the clouds set high on a hill!! Where they held their ceremony with the view in the backdrop, soft light with the light blue (half stormy) sky and sea with sun breaking through was stunning for my photos!! And to top it off the speeches made you want to cry!'
p1399
aS'From the Bride  Before we d even met (and a decade apart), the island of Ibiza was where we both had our first ever holidays away from our parents when we were 17  Andrew s trip being in 1988 and mine in 1998! Both trips were a very different experience to the side of Ibiza we have since come to love, but the seed was planted nonetheless! We have since re-visited the island as a couple and with friends and can t deny there is something special about the place. There are frequent moments when you look out at the crystal clear waters, beautiful sunset or when you are chatting with friends over a BBQ that you think that this is what you have waited all year for   times like these, in a place like this. That feeling is something that we wanted to share with our closest friends and family on our wedding day and to enjoy the moment and location that we love so much together.'
p1400
aS'I had been very much inspired by 1920 s-1930 s Hollywood glamour. I didn t want it to be too glitzy though and loved the juxtaposition of touches of glamour centred in a naturally beautiful surrounding; an embellished beaded gown and statement red lip (thank you Elizabeth Taylor!) with the simplicity of the wedding set up and tables with crisp white table cloths and a small natural wildflower centre. This really let the natural beauty of the location take centre stage but added a little extra sparkle to fit the occasion.'
p1401
aS'It sounds so clich , but the day was everything we d hoped for, so much time spent on detailing really paid off; studding starfish with crystals until 1 in the morning, handwriting every luggage tag for the table plan, sticking on tiny bits of vintage lace and lining a vintage suitcase with a wallpaper whose colour matched the bridesmaid dresses exactly   things that as I was doing them I was cursing myself for, but I knew it would make all the difference to the overall feel of the day. The whole is only as impactful because of the sum of the parts! There had been huge thunder and lightening storms all week and we were planning on an outside ceremony around the pool so our fantastic wedding planner had quickly whipped up a Plan B in case the heavens opened, but they didn t! There was beautiful sunshine but not too hot, truly perfect. Now, 3 months on I am still obsessed with looking through the photos and I long to have the day over again. It took us seven years and a little boy before we tied the knot so it was most definitely worth the wait.'

S'Let me set the scene   an intimate 4o guest affair in The Bahamas, with sparkly turquoise waters and sand between the toes. It s exactly how these sweeties said  I do,  and even better? The bride happens to be our own beloved LBBer, Mum s Flowers. Not only did she hand-pick her bouquet from the side of the road (ah-mazing!) but she brought on Jeremiah And Rachel to photograph the day. Oh, and you can escape to paradise via the gorgeous gallery right here!'
p1454
aS'From the Bride  I ve been traveling to the out islands of the Bahamas every year with my family since I was 6 months old. Over the years Eleuthera has become my favorite island with its friendly local people, colorful buildings, and old world Caribbean charm. I knew from a young age that I wanted to celebrate my marriage here, on  Bahamian time  barefoot on the beach with my closest family and friends.'
p1455
aS'Dan and I met when I was in college at PLNU and he was in Navy Seal training at Coronado. We are both from a small mountain town in Montana and met through mutual friends in San Diego. Four years later, after his first deployment to Iraq and my first year owning a busy flower shop back in our hometown of Whitefish, MT we started dating. We decided to get married a year later in a simple courthouse ceremony before his second deployment to Afghanistan, making plans for a destination wedding when he got back.'
p1456
aS'I m at that age where all of my friends are getting married and we ve spent so much time and money traveling all over the country to see the couple for 3 minutes at the reception and so it was important to me that we were able to spend quality time with everyone who made the trip out. I also wanted to make sure our wedding wasn t stressful for either of us  . I see so many brides in tears the week before their wedding and I hate the stress that weddings creates. Instead we created a stress-free vacation, everyone pitching in to help if needed but really simplifying the process and making it more about time spent together rather than time spent decorating. I picked the flowers for my bouquet from along side the road by the house the morning of the wedding (since hurricane Sandy hit the island 2 short weeks before our big day, it was slim pickings!) and my dad made my favorite poppyseed cake (don t let him fool you, he doesn t do this for a living, he s just an artist :) We flew out some close photographer friends of mine and walked down the beach to dinner at the beach house. My dress is from an incredible new designer, Sareh Nouri, who I met at a bridal salon in New Jersey and fell IN LOVE with her designs and her lovely personality, accompanied by a BHLDN headpiece, my grandmother s vintage diamond Hamilton watch from 1920, and Kate Spade sandals. We printed customized welcome totes for all our guests filled with maps, underwater cameras, sunscreen, and lots of other local goodies to make their vacation more enjoyable.'
p1457
aS'After producing over a hundred weddings myself, I wanted to make sure we kept our wedding intimate with the focus on our marriage and our guests. I planned a week long getaway for 40 of our closest family and friends, renting large houses on the beach where everyone could stay together. We spend the week leading up to the wedding basking in the turquoise clear water, kayak surfing the gentle waves, snorkeling and free diving for lobster and local fish, dueling it out on the beach volleyball court we set up in front of the house, and sharing large home-cooked meals together under the bright starry skies. By the time our wedding rolled around everyone was relaxed, tan, happy and had made new friends wishing we could stay 2 more weeks.'
p1458
aS'The wedding was absolute perfection, more than anything I could have ever dreamed   from the laid back beach venue, to the hand made cake my mom and dad baked, designed, and decorated together, our simple personal vows, the high tide coming up to soak our feet, the yummy coconut fresh grouper and conch fritters, and the local rake and scrape band to dance the night away. We re already planning a yearly reunion with all of our guests.\n'

p1513
aS'Angela and Brian are an German-American couple living in Boston, Angela growin up in Germany, both are scientist. They got engaged on Thanksgiving Day 2012 and when deciding on a location for their wedding they quickly realized that their dream wedding would be to spend a wedding week with family and friends, and get married outdoors in a Tuscan farmhouse or wine estate.'
p1514
aS'They found the perfect venue in Villa Lean, a XII century villa, with its beautiful views of the Lucca Valley and relaxing setting amongst olive groves and vineyards and they couldn t find better place to celebrate it! Stunning photos from Lisa Poggi tell all about their special day!'
p1515
aS'Key-words of this pretty rustic wedding are : simplicity, brightness and yellow colors starting from wooden table ceremony I arranged with the sunflowers d cor to the long reception table, which I set up with loose red and yellow flowers in jars, with sage, thyme, rosmary and organic lemons. Invitation booklets and stationary were lovely designed by the groom himself.'
p1516
aS'A lot of personal and inspiring details:'
p1517
aS'Instead of a guestbook, the couple opted for a  wine box wish box , where their guests wrote messages on little cards which were then placed in a wine bottle box with local Tuscan wine.'
p1518
aS'As part of the German tradition, happy balloons were released to bring the couple luck, and family and guests created a lovely  Tree of Life  life painting during the reception as a gift for bride and groom. Throughout the week all guests enjoyed the local organic food and cooking classes as well as trips to Florence, Pisa, and the Chianti region.'

p1560
aS'From From Art Director La Fianc e du Panda  We had been thinking for quite some time about doing a wedding inspiration photoshoot which would be really different, very modern, and could inspire brides and grooms in search for a new form of urban romanticism. It finally all came up together in a matter of weeks when we envisioned a mix of black and white geometric forms with an arty feeling, wild flowers, and a touch of gold to add in some glamour. We worked a lot of inspirations and ideas with Les Cocottes Events design, and the result came out beautifully.'

All the stationery was especially made with a mood board as guideline. The colors of the flowers and stationery were also a guide throughout all of the shoot. Because the theme for the shoot had an edge of vintage we tried to make it as romantic and soft as possible. That meant that also the suit and dress should be a mix of romantic and modern. A style a lot of couples really appreciate now a days.'

aS'From the Bride  I wanted our wedding to be about us and reflective of our love and who we are today. My husband and I met at work. Before we were an official couple, he used to bring me heart cookies from a place he would eat lunch at   so, I had to have those cookies as a memento of the beginning days of our relationship. We dated for three years. We traveled to India and Indonesia for three months   we ve had some amazing times together.'

After spending weeks editing the proposal video and telling me he had to work late at the office, one night, he asked if I wanted to see a photographer s video style that he admired   it was late, but I wanted to be supportive, so I said yes. The video began and then suddenly shifted gears and turned to pictures of us synchronized to Bruno Mars, Just the Way You Are. It was edited so perfectly that the song played   her laugh her laugh , there was a photo of me laughing. I was amazed, yet, did not expect a proposal. I actually thought he was practicing his own editing skills and showing me what he had made.'

aS'Strangely, he was wearing a rather baggy sweat-pant, sweat-shirt outfit, but I didn t really notice at the time how unusual it was. In the middle of the video, he got up and started taking this strange outfit off to reveal a suit and tie underneath. He was wearing the sweatsuit because I was out to dinner with a girlfriend and he was waiting for me to get home   a suit would have been even more strange. He made his way over to me and got on one knee and asked me to spend the rest of my life with him. I started to cry immediately   never even looked at the ring until after our hug fest. It was so sweet, I will always remember how I felt. Shaun designed my ring with his dad, who recently took up jewelry making as a hobby. His dad designed and made Shaun s ring as well and we saw it for the first time on our wedding day! It s a circle of our initials   I thought it was so perfect!'
p1611
aS'Prior to our wedding, while traveling in India for a month, I collected some crystals for my wedding jewelry and Shaun s mom made me a necklace and a bracelet out of the crystals I got on our trip. The rest of my jewelry was from Swarovski. We planned our wedding in about eight months. We knew we wanted a beach wedding. We live at the beach, we vacation at the beach, we dive, snorkel, we love it. September in Malibu could not be more beautiful. The weather is perfect and the sunsets are generally amazing. We got lucky and had one of those perfect weather days coupled with a picture perfect sunset.'
p1612
aS'I got ready at the Malibu Beach Inn with my sister and my very best friend from 8th grade. They were my bridesmaids. Shaun couldn t decide and didn t like the idea of leaving anyone out, so he opted for no groomsmen. He got ready at the Malibu Motel with friends.'
p1613
aS'We saw each other for the first time before the ceremony. We requested a moment all to ourselves. No photographers, no one. We wanted that time to be totally organic and all for us. The waterworks quickly began and we were a mess before anything even started! We were just so ecstatic and excited and so happy. It was off the charts. We would look at each other with so much love and so much sweetness   that moment will forever be in my heart.'
p1614
aS'We decided to write our own vows   we did not want to wear microphones, so instead, after the ceremony, we put our vows in an area for guests to read if they were unable to hear us. Afterward, we were told that even though it was hard to hear, it was so personal and so touching just to look at our faces   they said they could tell something wonderful was happening. My fiances cousin married us   this was very meaningful and special for both of us. I was raised Christian, but my fiance was raised liberal Jewish   and we enjoyed embracing both traditions at our wedding. It was so fun to honor both families.'
p1615
aS'We opted not to have a schedule the night of our wedding so we conveyed to our guests that the night would be free flowing through a personal message we had printed on coasters. Our favors were Italian sparkling or still water called Sole. We felt it was perfect. I made a lot of the signage for our wedding and detailed the large balloons with tons of ribbon. I had three balloons, but one broke in the car   two turned out to be the perfect number anyway!'
p1616
aS'We made the flower arrangements with the help of Shaun s cousin. I wanted them to be soft and inexpensive. I ordered raw cotton from a cotton grower and then we paired them with balsa wood flowers and some white berries and feathers. It was awesome because we were able to create the flowers two weeks in advance because they were all dried. For fresh flowers, we used cut blush carnations both for their color, texture and low budget value. My favorite DIY project was my vows. I wanted them to be pretty so I got special paper and tied ribbon tails to the paper.'
p1617
aS'We rented the standard folding chairs and a few tables. But we splurged on some Shabby Chic furniture and it really made everything look amazing. I think the furniture made the whole event take on a different, more romantic vibe.\n'

A good ol  dose of stylish vitamin D by way of the gorgeous images from Studio Castillero Photography. And with The Dazzling Details at the design helm, you know this gallery is as good as they get. See even more here.'
p1645
aS'From the Bride Kevin and I knew we wanted a destination wedding before we were even engaged. We visited Dreams in Puerto Vallarta on a last minute mini vacation back in 2008 and absolutely fell in love with the area s pristine beaches, lush jungles and vibrant culture. That trip was the beginning of the couple we are today and has always held a special place in our hearts. Both Southern Californian natives, we knew we had to say our vows with the ocean as our backdrop, and knowing we would be paying for our wedding ourselves, affordable Puerto Vallarta became the perfect choice. After scouring the internet, we found the lovely and talented ladies of The Dazzling Details, their services and the venue were booked before Kevin even popped the question! (Yes, I am a planner and booking before the New Year meant additional savings, ha!)'
p1646
aS' Our wedding day was nothing short of spectacular! Over 80 friends and family made the trip to Dreams over President s Day Weekend 2012 to celebrate with us. The Dazzling Details used every detail and element I had described or suggested in our emails (even ordering a coral chevron fabric I had fallen in love with months ahead of time) and turned the affair into a beautiful mix of classic elegance and modern flair. From the ghost chairs and paper lantern lit tent, to the handmade programs and maracas, no detail was left unnoticed. They even managed to incorporate Kevin s favorite pastime   hockey   in a classy way as a backdrop for the table numbers.'
p1647
aS' Most importantly, our friends and family had the time of their lives and are still reminiscing about the amazing time they had and how it was the most incredible wedding they had ever been to. Rachel and Rico, our photographers from Studio Castillero and Tom and Mindy, our videographers from Aqua Vivus captured every moment beautifully. It was a day we will cherish forever and can now continue to relive through their work. We wish we could come back every year and repeat the same party complete with fireworks!'

p1674
aS'From Katie Stoops  Set within a crumbling massive 19th century abandoned home, Jemma Cassidy of HipHip events in Dublin designed a shoot that was filled with character and a mysterious elegance. We were enchanted with the visual of a stunning model who had a lightness about her against the heavy features that this building so desperately wanted to hold onto. The tarnished brass and gold complemented the rich jewel tones in the table setting & florals.'

aS'From the Bride  Nick and I met while working together. I noticed him first and asked a mutual friend who the cute guy was! For several days I would wear my cutest outfits and re apply lipgloss in hopes that he would notice me. Nick ended up asking the same mutual friend about me and we went out on a lunch date. After that, the rest was history!'
p1729
aS'I always wanted a romantic outdoor wedding. Nick and I have had so many amazing memories over shared bottles of wine and a vineyard seemed like the perfect venue. I searched for months for a local vineyard that fit our budget and style. When I found Grace Vineyard I immediately fell in love with it! The colonial style estate combined with the vineyard was the perfect amount of romance!'
p1730
aS'I knew that with a summer wedding and Nick s Greek heritage that I wanted bold, fun colors combined with leafy ivy and cascading flowers. I chose pink, coral, orange, aqua, and soft touches of green to bring together summer and the numerous pinterest boards i obsessively made.'
p1731
aS'My favorite part of the wedding day was our first look. We opted to have a first look so we could share a special moment alone instead of in front of all our guests. I was so nervous for Nick s reaction to all the hair, makeup, and dress, but when I turned around and saw his reaction I knew that everything was perfect.'
p1732
aS'I would tell other brides that they should definitely hire a wedding planner. I obsessively used Pinterest and combed through wedding blogs, but it takes a good wedding planner to see your vision and to make everything cohesive. Going Lovely thought of so many personal little details that I never even considered. I thought that I could pull it off by myself but leading up to the wedding I was overwhelmed with work, wedding appointments, and corresponding with vendors. I was so relieved that I knew that Going Lovely was on top of everything and knew my exact taste and that they could anticipate what I would like.\n'

S'I may have just recently returned home from a week-long vaca, but that doesn t mean I can t start planning my next amazing getaway.  A little trip that WILL include a magical place called Baja California, the locale of today s gorgeous affair from Sara Richardson.  It s a vibrant love-fest with crazy cool rentals from Del Cabo Event Design and pretty blooms from Mazarte Floral (the bride!).  See it all here.'
p1775
aS'From the Bride  I am very proud of the fact that I am from Baja California Sur. I absolutely love it here! One day, when I was a little girl, I visited Santa Rosalia s Church and I knew then that I wanted to get married in that church. I was very impressed by the unique and simple beauty that was designed by the Architect Gustavo Eiffel. I had never been to Paris but a little French Colony in the middle of the Baja was the perfect location!'
p1776
aS'Once I got engaged, my fianc  and I travelled to Santa Rosalia looking for the ideal place to have the reception. We were also in search for the best location to have unforgettable pictures taken on our wedding day. This area looks like it was stopped in time. You can see the deterioration of the buildings over the years but it is still incredibly beautiful. My fianc  fell in love with the place as well so it was set, our wedding would be in Santa Rosalia with a beautiful reception in Mulege, B.C.S. We chose a little Boutique Hotel right in the middle of Mulege named  Hotel Serenidad  and they had all I needed for my very special day. I must add that I am a professional florist specializing in weddings, so the entire concept was more than planned a long time ago and it was there where we found the right place to develop our wedding concept; eclectic, rustic/chic with a little vintage touch.'
p1777
aS'The whole family loved the idea of joining us in Santa Rosalia and Mulege for our wedding celebration. Three days of celebrations between Santa Rosalia s conservative French style and an eclectic relaxing atmosphere in Mulege. With my team s support from work we travelled with everything that we needed in order to create a harmonious ambience in the place. Our color palette: peach, cream, pale pink and greens with orange accents. Wooden tables with single runners, vases of various sizes, bouquets along the tables, a perfect pergola to decorate with hundreds of ribbons and hanging votive candles. A small and very warm reception surrounded by our loved ones. A beautiful soprano sang during the ceremony and during the reception. We also had a local band as well as a local DJ. It was incredible and exceeded our expectations that we were able to find everything that we needed for our big day locally. Not to mention all the delicious meals that we enjoyed during our three day celebration inside Hotel Serenidad. The main dish for our wedding day was a Serenidad specialty for the last 40 years.'
p1778
aS'We are looking forward to celebrating anniversaries in such a great location and being only 8 hours driving from our home town of Cabo. It was definitely worth all the work and we loved the images captured by our great friend and excellent photographer Sara Richardson. She understood perfectly the style that we were looking for and what we expected. Something magical to enjoy forever!'

And with the smiles for days, the happy, beautiful couple and the sweet handmade details, it s quite the preview. Alison Conklin Photography captured the day which has put a permagrin on every single one of us over at SMP HQ, and here s why!'
p1819
aS'From the stunning bride  We got married on on a warm and sunny Saturday in August in the middle of nowhere, about one hour outside of Cologne, where we live. We felt that the wedding should be authentic and reflect who we are, rather than meet other peoples  expectations so we kept it simple and personal.'
p1820
aS' We created a nice setting, making a lot of the details for the wedding ourselves. For place cards, we painted the tips of wooden spoons and tied handwritten name tags to them, to represent our love for good food and so people could use them later and think of us in their everyday lives. I sewed triangle streamers and made a bunch of giant pompoms to decorate the venue. We also put stickers with our wedding logo on 300 Reese s Pieces and placed some on each guest s plates, because they are our favorite candy from the US. For the guests who were staying overnight, we stuffed little white paper bags with our favorite gummy bear variations, sealed them with our stickers and put them on each guest s pillow. The invitations and menu cards were made by a graphic designer, according to our ideas and wishes.'
p1821
aS'To us, this day was never just about the two of us. We also wanted it to be about our families and friends, because they are the people who matter most to us, and after all, some of them traveled half the world to be with us, since part of my family lives in the US!'
p1822
aS' My uncle, who is a minister, married us underneath the birch trees in the venue s garden, in an unforgettable, very personal and emotional ceremony during which we both laughed and cried. On our way out, a friend of ours played the Beatles   All You Need is Love  on his electric guitar and sang while we enjoyed shower of rose petals, which my mother and bridesmaid had passed around the guests before the ceremony to surprise us   what a magical moment! And there was yet another surprise: all of a sudden, there were dozens of white and red heart shaped helium balloons, which we let fly. From the first look to the last dance, we enjoyed every second of our wedding and thankfully, we got the wonderful Alison Conklin and her husband Geoff to capture all these wonderful moments for us to remember for years to come!'

By having a destination wedding they were able to celebrate and holiday with their friends and family while enjoying all that Bali had to offer.

aS'The couple were married at the Royal Pita Maha, a one of a kind resort located in the spiritually charged village of Ubud, Bali. Guests were treated to amazing views, fantastic weather and great company. The location was chosen after Anna and Aaron had visited Bali during their engagement period. With the help of their very kind tour guide Mully they searched for something different and beautiful, a place where they could have a holiday with their nearest and dearest and even return to in the future.'
p1842
aS'Anna and Aaron saw each other before the ceremony so once they were wed they could immediately celebrate with their guests. The groom first saw his bride at the bottom of the resort by the Ayung River. We had decided on this location the day before, as it was truly a wonderful spot that was not only beautiful but intimate and private. The Royal Pita Maha had provide us with some amazing locations for photos. The resort is surrounded by cliffs creating a hidden oasis that boasts beautiful water features, well landscaped gardens and amazing villas.'
p1843
aS'Their Ceremony took place in a glass chapel that was positioned on the cliff side of the resort. This ensured that all guests had a view of not only the gorgeous couple but the rainforest valley that surrounded them. A cocktail hour followed with signature cocktails and acoustic music played by Anna s sister and cousin.'
p1844
aS'Traditional Balinese dancers accompanied by a Balinese band started what would be a very special and unique reception. The couple put on a glorious banquet accompanied by wine from around the world (thanks to their close friend that works in the industry). The night ended as it should with everyone on the dance floor.'

aS'From the Bride  Brad and I knew very early on we wanted a destination wedding. We both fell in love with Puerto Vallarta and knew it was the perfect location for our wedding. Puerto Vallarta is a city filled with remnants of classic architecture, cobblestone streets and breathtaking views from the hills that surround the bay. It is absolutely beautiful and completely charming.'
p1897
aS'I wanted to juxtapose the rustic charm of Puerto Vallarta and our venue, Villa Celeste, with chic, simple details and a soft color palette. Brad had only one request when planning the wedding: a ridiculously fun reception. We hired The Dazzling Details {wedding planners extraordinaire!} to bring our vision to life.'

S'If you know me even a little bit, you know that title caught my eye and stole my heart. A true Anglophile, the traditional English wedding is my ultimate weakness. Especially when it s this beautiful and when JoPhoto was there to capture every beautiful moment!'
p1981
aS'From the photographer  On October 5, 2013, we photographed Morven and Steve s English wedding in York, England. The ceremony was at the York Minster, and the reception was at Allerton Castle.'
p1982
aS'To get married in the York Minster, couples must receive a special license from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Morven s family obtained this license because her father, Jim (who was recognized by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions to the community and disabled people) and mother, Gill, are members of the Minster Community and the family had worshiped regularly at the Minster for many years.'
p1983
aS'The day began at the bride s family s home in a small village called Hessay. Rather than numbers on the houses, her family s home is simply named  Copperfield.  Each house in the village has a name instead of a number.'
p1984
aS'The bridesmaid s hairpieces with cream feathers and broaches were hand made, and the teal green bridesmaids dresses complimented the cascading pink, ivory, and green bouquets. Photos of the bride with her bridesmaids were taken in her father s orchard in the back yard of their home.'
p1985
aS'Morven and Steve s ceremony at the York Minster was a grand event. All the ladies wore hats, and the wedding guests sat in the choir area. Morven s mother s navy blue hat was especially large, with white decoration on top! The York Minster was built in the 600s and is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England.'
p1986
aS'After the wedding ceremony, Morven and Steve exited the York Minster and were greeted by hundreds of tourists and onlookers. We included a few photos of the crowd outside the minster. Guests were asking if they were famous, or royalty! We had to keep the crowd back from the couple for photos outside the York Minster.'
p1987
aS'Traveling from the minster to Allerton Castle, guests rode in vintage 1959 double-decker black and ivory buses. Allerton Castle is a 19th century gothic house with gardens and sheep grazing on the front lawn. The Great Hall certainly lives up to its name, with a gorgeous grand staircase and an almost 80-foot ceiling. Dinner was served in the stunning blue and white ballroom, and portraits were taken in the lavish drawing room. We had never seen such a gorgeous castle!'
p1988
aS'Toasts were much different than those we have experienced in Tennessee. Each speech was 20-30 minutes long, and the bride s father s speech was especially entertaining. At the end of his speech, he asked all the guests to blow up balloons, and then they all let the air out of the balloons and made funny noises while everyone was laughing!'
p1989
aS'Later in the evening, the band called  HUGE  entertained everyone with live music, and the groomsmen enjoyed drinks and pool in the Billiard Room.'
p1990

In other words, it s destination perfection, right down to the breathtaking views and complete happiness bursting from every second.  See it all right here.'
p2034
aS'From Rachel Rose Weddings  Maria was one of my brave brides who booked her wedding venue and our planning and styling services without ever meeting us or even viewing the venue. A brave lady, but we didnt disappoint! Maria and Simon s day was wonderful, full of smiles and laughter and a real intimate family affair with the children holding centre court throughout. Maria and Simon both have children from previous relationships and this union of their two families means they now have six wonderful children who are so close already you would never know they had only known each other a few years.'
p2035
aS'Maria wanted her styling to be relaxed but classic, so we chose a neutral color scheme to allow the beautiful grounds of Cortijo Pedro Jimenez to be the main backdrop to their day. The wedding ceremony was held in the grounds of the Cortijo with fabulous sea views behind them where the guests could see across the straights of Gibraltar to the atlas mountains of Morocco. They were then treated to champagne and canapes with homemade lemonade for the children in the traditional central courtyard followed by dinner and dancing under the stars on the pool lawn.'

The Dazzling Details styled every bloom in flawless fashion, and you can find even more pin-able moments in the gallery right here.'
p2063
aS'From the Bride  I have always wanted to get married in my hometown of Santa Barbara but after my husband Matt and I started talking about our wedding we knew we wanted to have a destination wedding. We loved the idea of having an intimate group of our family and closest friends with us on vacation celebrating our love. Next we needed to decide on our wedding location. We decided against more remote locations like Fiji and decided on Mexico. Matt let me decide on the town! I searched online for weeks and came across The Dazzling Details. After seeing their weddings I knew I wanted them to plan my wedding so we decided on Puerto Vallarta.'
p2064
aS'My favorite moment of the day was standing bare foot in the sand exchanging our handwritten vows. I have never had so many emotions come over me. We both thought we would be able to hold it together but we both had tears running down our cheeks by the end of our vows.'
p2065

S'When the words  destination  and  wedding  and  Umbira  are all used in one thought, your pulse is bound to quicken. Picture a totally glam, yet somehow laid back and casual wedding set amongst the olive trees. One long table under a twinkly-lit tent. A couple that is off the carts gorgeous. Are you ready for this beautiful soiree from Weddings in Italy + Brooke Merrill?'
p2123
aS'From the celebrant  While thinking of Italy and above all a wedding in Italy, your imagination goes to Tuscany or Lakes district. However Italy is quite big and offers lots unique spots to have a personalized celebration.'
p2124
aS' When Arianne & Colin decided to tie the knot in Italy, they have never thought about Umbria. The laziest of the Italian regions, just in the middle of the country, located at few miles from Florence and Rome. Word-wide famous for the red wine, truffles, and jazz festival, this incredible tiny region offers amazing setting for a romantic wedding ceremonies and parties. Thanks to Rossana, the wedding planner the whole wedding party reached Tenuta di Canonica in Todi.'
p2125
aS' Arianne, worked for months on the idea of a multicolored palette mixing all the rustic and country elements of the venue with her own glamour and elegant style. A special thanks to Brooke Merrill for the beautiful photos, she captured this perfect mix between a romantic multicolored ceremony among the olive groves and the relaxing traditional Italian aperitif. At sunset the dinner with a great view: a big marquis with one single family style table light up the whole property with chandeliers, candles and hundreds of real grapes as tablescape: like a modern  Baccanale  where food, wines and candles lights created and unbelievable atmosphere. Gelato and tiramis  have been served at midnight to celebrate the newly wed, and Aaron Colbert and his music turned the lazy Tenuta in an incredible disco, beyond imagination.'

S'Anyone that knows me knows one thing: I heart all things British.  So a drop-dead gorgeous English countryside wedding at the Boconnoc House And Estate?  Right up my alley.  Especially one as beautiful as this elegant day, with its colorful blooms, stylish attire (hello stunning Jenny Packham gown) and breathtaking gallery of images captured by Sarah Falugo.  See them all right here.'
p2143
aS'From Sarah Falugo  Boconnoc House and Estate is a quintessentially English wedding venue. The house dates back to 1250 AD and the grounds, complete with deer park and its own church is a hidden gem in the Cornish countryside. Emma and Terence were married in the church on the grounds and then stayed on site with friends and family to have a garden party and slap up meal in the height of the English summer.'
p2144
aS'Emma wore a stylish Jenny Packham wedding dress. The decorations were a mixture of colored glass bottles and beautiful English roses.'

S'I love a wedding that marches to the beat of it s own drum. A wedding that bucks tradition and breaks all the rules in the prettiest of ways. *Enter* this Portugal beauty straight from the lens of Matt And Lena Photography. With the most picturesque woodland ceremony followed by picnic on the beach, these love birds said  I do  on their very own terms. Want even more? We ve got it waiting right here!'
p2171
aS'From the sister of the groom  When my brother Daniel and his wife to be Doreen told me about their decision to marry in Portugal I was overly joyed. This would be my first wedding in Portugal and my mind was already spinning with endless ideas. Knowing Doreen, I knew that her special day would have to be the ultimate romantic fairy tale. D&D both share a passion for flea markets, vintage music, shabby chic home-style, nature and everything with that sort of patine that makes us dream again. Perfect for a vintage girl like myself.'
p2172
aS'But there was one issue: LOCATION. Our Quinta, Bella Vista, was still in shambles, so we would have to shop around. We decided that pictures alone, won t do, one must feel the space for such an important moment in life and so D&D flew in and we went on a massive scouting week. We visited countless of Quintas one more beautiful then the next, yet there was always something that did not fit the dream. When their time over here came to an end and we still had no location, I started to worry. Doreen seemed to loose all hope, her pre-marriage glow fading away, when finally we spotted a perfect place. Quinta Matalva. Ahhh, stones dropped from my shoulders and smiles were back on. Matalva has an enchanting garden with an old wall which was seemed for the wedding backdrop. D&D went back home and excitedly booked the Quinta. Only much later we found out, that this part of the garden belonged to the main house which was a separate property and would not be available for use. Oh no!'
p2173
aS'Trying to find another area in the garden that would suit D&D s expectations proofed fruitless. That s when I decided that Quinta Bella Vista could be the place for the ceremony. Still under construction, it however has an area framed by proud plane trees, offering dazzling views over the villages and the Atlantic, perfectly isolated and utterly romantic. Taking some snapshots in the afternoon light (the preferred time of the wedding) I was immediately taken. Fairy tale here we come. D&D seemed equally thrilled after they saw the pictures in the golden afternoon glow and from there our imagination just run wild.'
p2174
aS'Doreen bombarded me with ideas and pictures she found online and slowly the wedding took shape. Rustic vintage was the style to be. I started to envision all the day of the wedding, from the arrival of our guests, the entrance of the bride to  a sunset picnic and a home-cooked dinner. I wanted everything to be special, unforgettable and I wanted surprises everywhere. That s how I thought of an open jeep, filled with hay for seats to shuttle the guests. The ceremony place was decorated like a living room in the wild, with a special photo-booth made from old frames. An artist friend painted a queen-sized sheet with a big heart, to be cut by the young lovers, an old german tradition. From the boy s boutonniere which was handmade by a village lady, the tile-style wedding cake and tile cookies, to the wooden signs with sweet messages, everything was made with love for love. The picnic in Adraga beach gave the perfect photo opportunity and we felt like on the set of an old movie.'
p2175
aS'When the delighted party returned back home to Matalva, dinner was already prepared in a sea of candles. We celebrated late into the night, thankful to be part of such a special moment. I wish D&D to be always as happy as on this day and I know that magic is everywhere where there is love. I also want to add, that magic is not that easy to be captured, but our photographers Matt and Lena did just that. They saved the magic for everyday. Thank you and everyone that helped us to make this dream become true.\n'

aS'From the Bride It was a very rainy week in the DR up until our wedding day. We had 56 people attend the wedding from Chicago, Sweden, Germany, New York, Michigan, and Houston. The morning of consisted with a morning swim, followed by breakfast in bed that was provided by the resort. Denis & I found it surreal that our wedding day finally arrived. After breakfast he went to his room to meet his grooms men to get ready for the day. My girls and I met in my honeymoon suite and got ready. It was a sunny and super hot day   the only day without any rain. We got ready, took pictures and by the time you knew it, it was time for the ceremony. Jenny & the Dreams La Romana team did a great job getting everything ready. We had a pier ceremony & a beach reception with LED lit dance floor   highly recommend this to any bride having a breach reception! At the end of reception, we had brought sky lanterns with us for each guest to make a wish and let into the sky. This is was coolest idea as everyone loved it and it was really pretty as the sky lanterns filled up the sky with pretty lights.'

aS'From the photographer  Anya + Brody live in Calgary, Alberta, one of the coldest places in the country, so they decided to get away from it all and marry in the hot and sunny Mayan Riviera, Mexico. For the 30+ family and friends who were able to take the trip across the continent, it was well worth the trip. Their wedding took place at the the beautiful Azul Sensatori Resort on the Skydeck of the resort, overlooking the oh-so-blue Caribbean Sea.'
p2262
aS'Anya was inspired by the turquoise of the sea as well as the floral accents that the tropical location provided, and her idea of the perfect wedding was one that was whimsical, yet incorporated Mexican elements like  Dia de los Muertos  skulls into the decor and invitations. Most of all, the bride and groom wanted an environment where everyone felt comfortable and ready to enjoy themselves! With a morning of an and off downpour, Anya + Brody married atop the resort s rooftop deck, and the skies opened up to the most beautiful deep blue for an unbelievable and moving ceremony.'
p2263
aS'The reception was to take place in the sand, underneath the palm trees that had been strung with twinkling lights   however, the weather took a turn for the worse and the event had to be moved indoors to a nearby restaurant on the resort. Regardless of the change in location, the bride and groom weathered the storm with smiles on their faces. After a few heartfelt and hilarious toasts, the guests enjoyed a traditional Mexican family style meal followed by tequila and dancing! Anya + Brody s wedding was truly an event to remember!\n'

Think a blush-hued masterpiece planned by My Italian Wedding with ruffles and gold as far as the eye can see.  Check out every beautiful moment captured by Aljosa Videtic in the full gallery.'
p2289
aS'From the Bride  I had no idea Scott was going to propose when he did. I was supposed to be going out for girls  night, or so I thought, but Scott had my friend in on his plan. I was completely surprised and couldnt have been happier. We talked about different options for the wedding and as soon as we talked about a Venice wedding, we both got super excited. This is because travelling has always been a big part of our relationship. Our first trip together was to Paris a couple months after we started dating so a wedding in Venice felt perfect. We were very lucky to have 24 of our family and friends fly from Los Angeles to Venice for the wedding festivities. The wedding was absolutely perfect and we wouldn t have changed anything.'
p2290
aS'The color theme was all around gold, white, blush and pink tones  this was reflected in my dress choice, too.'
p2291
aS'Of all the dresses I tried on this dress was the most unique and when I tried it on I fell in love with it. It even fit me perfect. I only had to have it shortened a couple inches. I loved the color of the dress, the detail in the top portion and the design of the skirt. The most special part of the dress is the color. At first glance it looks champagne, but it pulls color from lighting around it. Sometimes it looks blush even.'
p2292
aS'From My Italian Wedding  Danielle and Scott contacted us last year because they wanted to get married in Venice. They are travellers from LA and they visited this city a few years ago. They completely felt in love with its beauty and so they decided to have an intimate destination wedding here. They wanted something  really Venetian  but at the same time not commercial (they did not wanted a hotel or a structured accomodation) which give them and their guests a true experience. So we found this decadent villa in Canareggio, one of the quietest and traditional districts in Venice, which was full of character and dusted furniture and mirrors  literally there was a room full of sofas and chairs that we took out from the dark and arranged in the main hall and in the terrace. The gold wallpapered room was completely empty, so was the terrace where the symbolic ceremony took place. We used a lot of pom poms in different size and shapes (ordered on UK and all hand carried around Venice in our little luggages!), cushions to decorate the old sofas and vintage table cloths for the reception tables. And lots of white, pink and blush flowers which gave a romantic touch to the decadent look of the villa.'

With crystal candle chandeliers, gold silverware, monograms and natural opulent flowers of Peonies and David Austin roses we combine romance and elegance with the natural outdoors.\n And with Succulents as our main themed flower for the reception and bridal party we pay homage to a growing plant trend and the setting we are in whilst adding texture and interest to our floral arrangement.'
p2359
aS' With children also as our focus on this shoot we take a look at what the bridal party get up to by telling the story of their adventure from coming down the aisle, to them discovering the dessert table with all the treats of Grayed Jade (mint green) to the fun and games they have near the lake and on the long grass, adding the fun element to the sophistication.\n'

aS'From the Bride  We fell in love with Esperanza the moment we arrived. From the ambiance, breathtaking ocean views, endless amenities and sense of privacy, Chad and I knew we had to have our destination wedding at Esperanza! With the love & support of our families, we started the planning process which included two site visits to the beautiful Los Cabo region. Any excuse to travel to Mexico, right?'
p2377
aS'My wedding vision all started with my dress! I purchased my Lazaro gown months before we traveled to Cabo San Lucas to scout for wedding venues. We got engaged in December 2011, and I said YES to the dress two months later in February. My dress was making its first debut off the runway at Lazaro s trunk show at Kleinfeld bridal in NYC and I had to be there! I knew the dress was the ONE from the moment I saw it on the internet. I fell in love watching a video clip from Lazaro s fall runway show. My dress embodied exactly how I wanted to feel on my wedding day; classic, sexy and chic! I also had the opportunity to meet my gown s designer, Perez Lazaro, twice! At my first fitting, Lazaro helped me with the alternation of the belt so it was placed in the right location to give me some curves.'
p2378
aS'I thoroughly enjoyed the entire wedding planning process! I started my own amateur blog, adestinationwedding.com, shortly after we got engaged. From the numerous Pinterest wedding-themed boards, endless bridal magazines, web-searching for the best vendors Cabo had to offer, you could say I did my due diligence when it came to planning our wedding. I love all the little details that go into a wedding. I believe its the little details that truly capture the couple and their love for one another, and their guests. Some of my favorite details from our wedding was the personalized welcome totes and coozies, sparklers, chalkboard wedding program, my DIY bridal garter and having our favorite Esperanza margarita, Cabo Green, as our escort drink beverage!'

aS'Our wedding festivities in Cabo started with a Welcome Fiesta we hosted at the Hilton Los Cabo. Guests walked down to the beach to enjoy cocktails, hors d ouevres & music. With the help of Lazy Gourmet & the Hilton, we set up the perfect space on the beach for guests to enjoy, including a lounge set, bean bags & a bonfire. The staff at the Hilton also greeted our guests with margaritas in our personalized wedding coozies. The rest of the weekend our guests enjoyed golfing at Pamilla, deep-sea fishing, rehearsal dinner at Hacienda Y Cantina, a sunset margarita cruise and bar-crawling.'

aS'We feel so special and loved that 67 of our closest family and friends traveled to Cabo San Lucas to witness Chad and I exchange our vows. Esperanza, and Cabo San Lucas will always have a huge part of my heart. We could not have chosen a more beautiful and romantic location to become husband and wife. Esperanza s pool terrace overlooking the infinity pool and ocean will always be one of my favorite ceremony locations, not only because we got married there. It s so peaceful and beautiful. I love feeling the breeze off the ocean as you stand there admiring all the beauty around you. After our ceremony, guests enjoyed a cocktail hour around the pool terrace. We surprised our guests with a mariachi band to start the celebration off in fun way! Our guests soon moved to the terraces of Esperanza s restaurant, where they dined on the cliffs overlooking the ocean. The sun was sunsetting as we enjoyed dinner, had our first dance by Ed Sheeran  Kiss me , and listened to speeches by my father, Maid of Honors & Best Man. The mirror runners & candles on our long tables sparkled as the night began to darken. We transitioned to our final location at Esperanza with a sparklers send-off! Chad and I ran through our guests to our final location for dancing, cigars + cocktails. Our last surprise for our guests was a cigar bar with hand-rolled vanilla cigars to enjoy overlooking yet another beautiful terrace. DJ Mijares played music all night long. We ended the night with  Love Somebody  by Maroon 5, and afterwards I took the microphone to thank everyone for traveling to our destination wedding. We had the time of our lives!'

aS'With the help of our amazing vendors in Cabo, we had our fairytale wedding (that s what our guests are calling it!). I can not thank Amy Bennett Photography, Elements Mixed Media, Cabo Floral, Linen, Things & More, Suzanne Morel, DJ Mijares, Lazy Gourmet and Reverend Marco Arechiga enough for their professionalism & top-notch service. Some may think planning a destination wedding is difficult, but I disagree 100%. I had the most wonderful experience. Every couple should have the opportunity to work with such amazing people.'

S'If you haven t already considered a gorgeous vaca in Italy, this beautiful wedding captured by Amy Rizzuto is here to tell you one thing: you need to.  Because this is the kind of wedding that is as rich in breathtaking scenery as it is in fabulous details.  Think classic stylings from Exclusive Italy Weddings meets awe-inspiring moments a plenty.  See it all right here in the full gallery.'
p2435
aS'From Amy Rizzuto Photography  The sun seemed to glisten across the cobblestone streets in Florence, Italy on June 20th. The day was finally here and Brittany and Aaron seemed to carry a child-like anticipation as they prepared to see each other for the first time. In the lovely gardens that could be seen from their private balcony, Aaron slowly turned around to see his beautiful bride walking towards him. Breath taken away, he wrapped Brittany in his arms, so excited to make this girl he met back in the first grade his wife.'
p2436
aS'After their emotional first look, we explored the most beautiful parts of Florence together. We captured pretty portraits of Brittany and Aaron strolling in the Piazza della Signoria, among the statues of Loggia dei Lanzi, and of course, in front of the Ponte Vecchio. At noon, they were married in the famous Red Room in the Palazzo Vecchio with their closest family and friends around them. They celebrated afterwards at Alle Murate, laughing as they enjoyed a true five-course Italian meal.'
p2437
aS'From the Bride  Aaron and I spent the first month of our engagement sifting through ideas for our wedding. The more progress we made in the pre-planning process, the more we realized a lavish affair with hundreds of guests was not what our hearts desired. We wanted our celebration to be intimate and centered around what mattered most, our marriage, and making sure we had the time and energy to enjoy our special day, and spend time with one another and those who love us. A colleague of mine mentioned a destination wedding, and after we discussed it there was no doubt that we were going to have our wedding somewhere far from home.'
p2438
aS'We had already decided Italy would be our honeymoon destination, and what a romantic place for a destination wedding. We wanted our ceremony to be in a place we both had never visited, and we chose Florence. The city was perfect because it is known as the birthplace of the Renaissance, and we would be embarking upon a new beginning of our lives in the city of rebirth. I envisioned a wedding with a vintage, old Hollywood feel. The red hall in Palazzo Vecchio was the absolute perfect location  It felt incredibly regal and reminded me so much of my wedding day inspiration, Grace Kelly.'
p2439
aS'I contacted Exclusive Italy Weddings, and our wedding planner, Martina, was fantastic. She assisted us with booking the location, flowers, transportation, and the absolutely gorgeous reception location, Alle Murate. Because neither of us are Italian we had to arrive in Florence a few days early to complete several rounds of paperwork. Martina arranged for our wonderful new friend, Mrs. Jo, to serve as our translator and assistant through the paperwork and the ceremony. Our photographer, Amy Rizzuto, was amazing and such a pleasure to have around. She met with us prior to the ceremony to share her thoughts on the best time for photos, etc. and she couldn t have been more perfect. The pictures from our special day depict the love and emotions flowing from everyone involved. When I look at the photos I feel as if our wedding was a true fairytale.'
p2440
aS'I have several memories from our wedding day I ll never forget  my dad walking me down the aisle, my mother helping me into my dress  and exchanging our rings while the Italian official recited an Apache Creed in English (the only part of the ceremony that didn t have to be translated for us). Aaron s favorite memory is the early morning (7 a.m.) photo session with Amy in which we pranced all around the city finding the best photo ops. It was a truly magical day that will forever be etched in our memories.'

S'I ve (sadly) never made the journey to Greece, but this gorgeous day captured by Anna Roussos Photography has most definitely moved this beautiful country up on my list of must-sees.  Because this is the type of wedding that isn t just chock-full of heartwarming moments (oh, is it ever), it s a lesson in all things pretty.  See every stunning moment right here in the full gallery.'
p2466
aS'From Anna Roussos Photography  I don t know how to describe this wonderful wedding!'
p2467
aS' When Claire and Robin told me that they were planning to get married in Spetses at the Poseidonion Grand Hotel, I got really exited. This is one of my favorite hotels in Greece. I can photograph every corner of this stylish hotel without ever getting bored!  But when they told me that the ceremony would take place in the ancient amphitheater of Spetses, then I started to count the days to their wedding day!'
p2468
aS' Claire was a stunning bride!! I just loved her very sophisticated, stylish and sexy dress by Jenny Pakcham. Claire made the whole place shine when she appeared on the aisle. And I saw tears in Robin s eyes as Claire, his bride, was walking towards him with her dad.\n The ceremony was beautiful and so peaceful: the old amphitheater was decorated in a lovely fashion with olive trees, lavender flowers and papel picado garlands. All guests were seated on the steps of the old theater and Claire and Robin stood in the middle as they exchanged their vows. After a few refreshing drinks, all the guests walked together with the couple down the hill towards the main road to go to the reception venue: Poseidonion Grand Hotel. What about me? I stole this lovely couple for some photos around the island, while the guests were enjoying the cocktail hour.'
p2469
aS' What is more romantic than you and your hubby in the horse carriage, both looking so stunning and being just married??  Local people were cheering the newlyweds, wishing them all the happiness, as they were riding though the little streets of Spetses. I think it was a truly unforgettable experience for Claire & Robin.'
p2470
aS' And I must tell you about the horse carriage driver: he was awesome, with dreadlocks and ray ban sunglasses, a Bob Marley fan for sure.  I don t know if they chose him on purpose or it was just luck, but all I can say is that everything about their wedding day was so cool! No matter how conservative the location and venue were, you could could see Claire s and Robin s touch everywhere. '
p2471
aS' I couldn t help noticing all the handmade details Claire prepared back at home. Look at this stand with the guests names and lovely personal letters to each of them, which Claire and Robin wrote. Please notice that there were more than 70 guests!!'
p2472
aS' This shows how everybody invited was so important to them and how Claire and Robin were in turn important to all the guests of the wedding. That s why the party was so great, full of fun and laughter and this was one of the first times, when I actually got upset when the party was already over.  I didn t notice that it was already nearly 3 am!'
p2473
aS' Dear Claire and Robin, I can t thank you enough for your trust! You were so nice and friendly, you made me feel like I ve known you forever! And I think that s why you have so many bright people around you, because both of you are so positive! You are lucky to have each other and I wish you all the best of the best!'

And it s something worthy of your every swoon. Four Winds Weddings designed and planned a beautiful day, which was captured as only A Brit & A Blonde can, and lucky for you it s all right here!'
p2519
aS'From the designer  Jennifer and Jean-Pierre live in Austin, Texas. They wanted a destination wedding for their big day and chose Playa Langosta in Costa Rica to say their I do s. Jean-Pierre is an architect and loves clean lines and modern minimalistic decor. Jennifer wanted organic designs with a bright, modern color palate. In order to fuse the two slightly diverging design visions, we decided to incorporate bold architectural design elements and soften them with organic accents. For the wedding altar, we used a oversized dark wooden structure and softened it with asymmetrical jungle foliage. Guests were seated on super modern acrylic ghost chairs.'
p2520
aS'For the table designs, we opted to incorporate modern asymmetrical ceramic vases with soft and abundant floral designs. In addition, we incorporated a collection of small salvaged bottles with monochromatic petite bouquets to further complete the oversized tablescape. The tables that we chose also fused the two design styles as they had a modern/minimalistic base with an organic, solid Guanacaste wooded top.'
p2521
aS'Jennifer s bouquet contained blown roses (peach, coral and white), Stargazer lily, succulents, pink ginger, and dianthus,'
p2522
aS'That yummy blue drink they called the Penny Colada (after their dog!)- It contained rum, blue cura ao, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice and was served up during cocktails.'
p2523
aS'The speciality handmaid vodka, Tito s, came from Austin, Texas. It acted as their wedding favor for their guests. And was a nice surprise for their austin guests to see and a feeling of home.'
p2524
aS'During the design brainstorming phase, Jennifer pinned a vintage marquee sign that we just fell in love with. Since we weren t able to source this here in Costa Rica, we decided to DIY the sign. This, for us, was one of the highlights of the overall event design. Our goal with Four Winds Weddings & Events has always been to create events that embody the uniqueness of the couples that we work with while simultaneously challenging us as event designers.\n'

aS'From Wedding Paris Pauline and Charif met in a bar many years ago and never left each other. They decided to get married on June 15th 2013 in the family castle, a typical  Ch teau de la Loire  that tourists can visit during the year. With its medieval donjon, moat and drawbridge, it was the perfect venue for a Fairy Tale Wedding. The castle features tremendous gothic fireplaces and other furniture from the XVth century. There are also very romantic gardens with more than 450 varieties of roses where the cocktail of 400 guests took place.'
p2540
aS'Pauline and Charif are very clever people; they are keen on books and beautiful stories, that s why they wanted this Fairy Tale theme for their Wedding. The dinner of 200 guests was really into this inspiration: The tables were determined by French fairy tale names (Le Chat Bott , Aladin, Blanche Neige, Le petit Chaperon Rouge) and the table seating plan was book shaped, all the details were in this mood.\n This wedding was the perfect combination of Middle Age and stories, with a touch of Charif s Lebanese origins.'
p2541
aS'Pauline arrived in the morning at her parent s castle where she had her hair and make-up done.The couple attended a religious ceremony in a church. Then, they arrived surrounded by the  bons entonneurs  guards at an amazing cocktail with fruit juice bar and a Jazz trio playing music. The dinner was so warm hearted with many moving speeches and a very festive atmosphere with an active bar.'

It s a beautiful story, an amazing setting and a gorgeous bride and groom celebrating their love with their closest friends and family in Fiji.  In other words, it s the kind of day that fills your day with soooo much love and soooo much joy, you seriously consider sending thank you notes.  See it all captured by Malia Johnson right here.'
p2568
aS'From the Bride  I am so excited to be able to share with you pictures with you of our Fijian Fantasy wedding. It was such an amazing day, especially when I didn t think I had the bride gene before this all started. I think the fact that it was a destination wedding with only 40 of our closest friends and family and that we were all on holiday made the day even more special.'
p2569
aS'After losing my dad just before my 7th birthday, I grew up always picturing my Mum walk me down the aisle. She had truly been my best friend so when I lost her a few months after my 18th birthday, I stopped dreaming of a big white wedding. So when Pieter proposed I did not begin the planning with the same vigour as many other brides because I thought the day would actually highlight all of my family that would be missing. I pictured the day as being more about Pieter s family and grew worried about it having that special feel.'
p2570
aS'When I raised that idea of a destination wedding Pieter agreed it would be good as it would mean that only those people that mean the most to us would actually be there. We feel in love with the seaside chapel at the Shangri la Fijian Resort and spa. When 40 guests confirmed they were coming to Fiji not only for the wedding but a week long holiday we were over the moon.'
p2571
aS'On the day, my older brother walked me down the aisle. The first tears sprung in my eyes when he said  you know Mum would be so proud.  I had to stop his pep talk in the car as it was making my heart race. I held the picture of my mum that hung from my bouquet as I walked down the aisle and knew she was there in spirit.'
p2572
aS'As I saw Pieter, the sadness went and I knew that the rest of the day would be filled with smiles as we were surrounded by so many friends and family that travelled so far to witness us get married.'
p2573
aS'We had such an amazing time with nature putting on a show with the sun shining without it being too hot, whilst the locals including the staff all embraced as to make us feel special.'
p2574
aS'We were arrived to the reception, we were in for an amazing suprise. My sister-in-law had arrange a dessert table which was stunning and tasty. To think she had tranported all of those extra touches in hers (and her children s) suitcase. It provided a stunning talking piece and the personalised touch I thought would be hard to achieve with a destination wedding.'

aS'From the Bride  From the first moment Martin walked into the room, time stood still. My cousin introduced us, and from there our conversation began immediately as if we were old friends catching up. When we met, Martin was living in California and we began our long distance friendship through snail mail. Our love continued to grow deeper for one another through the years.'
p2602
aS'While Martin was living in California, I made a weekend trip to visit him in Laguna Beach. He surprised me by renting a Duffy boat in Newport harbor.When we got into the boat, he told me to go to the front where I found a small mailbox (we had written letters to each other, every day, for the past year!). By the time I finished reading the letter that was inside, he was down on his knee asking me to marry him. After I said yes, he asked me to look at the pier where a photographer was documenting the moment. Unforgettable!'
p2603
aS'Martin and I fell in love with the natural beauty of Mexico. The Riviera Maya worked for ease of travel for our family and guests. The fact that we were able to say our vows on the beach, in front of one of the largest coral reefs in the world, is something that has a spirit of grace and unity.'
p2604
aS'Planning the details of our wedding was a way to express who Martin and I are as a couple. I started with designing the save the date magnets, which led to envisioning and creating our wedding invitations.Throughout our journey we have used the scallop shell as our  wedding symbol . Being a sign of a pilgrim and pilgrimage, it has many meanings within Christianity as well as in daily life. Martin had a scallop shell on his boutonniere that his grandfather had given to Martin s grandmother on their wedding day.'
p2605
aS'The magazine, with digital and printed versions, was a way to let everyone know the events of the wedding week and to introduce all of the guests (and the photographers).'
p2606
aS'We placed custom mailboxes on all of the dinner tables, since we have a strong tradition of writing letters while apart. Each guest s place card had space for them to give us advice and then place the card into the mailbox. We plan to open a mailbox each year and read the cards for the next several years on our anniversary.'
p2607
aS'I made my bouquet with silk flowers, then took the first gift Martin gave to me and a cross he always wears and hid them inthe bouquet. The lace wrapped around the flowers came from my mother s wedding veil. The brooch holding the lace together was a gift from my grandma. The bridesmaids flowers were made by the resort, but I gave them color swatches of the dresses so the flowers would match the pastel tones they would be wearing.'
p2608
aS'My dress was by Catherine Deane for BHLDN, with some custom touches. The buttons on the back came from my mother s and my grandmother s wedding dresses. The sandals were Klub Nico, also from BHLDN. OPI s  Teal the cows come home  not only acted as my  something blue on my toes  but it honored the  Schreiber  family name, since they are cattle farmers. The fingertip veil was custom designed by Carol Tuazon in Chicago, to create a  waterfall . We used magnetic weights by Jill Watson of Save the Veil, so it wouldn t blow away in the Riviera Maya breeze.'
p2609
aS'Martin s suit came from Zara on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, IL, and his ocean-blue bow tie was from  1910 . His shoes were from Nordstrom, and his  something blue  socks were by Paul Stuart. I sewed his initials along with our wedding day into the lining. Both of our rings also have the wedding day and the saying  All is Well  engraved into them  a saying that we have used throughout our wedding planning!'

p2636
aS'From the Bride  Scott and I were introduced by my best friend from college when she was visiting me in Venice, CA. From the moment we met the sun and the beach have always played a big role in our lives as we spend our weekends riding bikes with friends, taking our dog on walks to watch the sunset, and planning our vacations around the best beaches in the world. It was no surprise that we took our first vacation as a couple to Cabo and have loved it ever since. When Scott proposed on a mountain (trying to change it up) in Costa Rica, we knew we had to get back to the beach for our wedding.'
p2637
aS'When we named our wedding website SunKissedLove, it was only a matter of time that we planned the theme of our wedding to match   a laid back beach wedding filled with sun and the love of our friends and family. The cobblestone streets of Cabo, the beautiful beaches and the something for everyone feel of Cabo was enough to convince us it was the place for us.'
p2638
aS'We did most of our planning via the internet, Pinterest and a weekend trip down to meet with vendors. We were referred to our awesome wedding planner, Amy Abbott through friends who had gotten married in Cabo and she showed us the Hacienda Cocina y Cantina, which we immediately fell in love with. Amy also found us our team of vendors including our amazing photographer Sara Richardson and our visonary florist Pina Hernandez. Its so important to have the right wedding planner who is patient and asks just the right questions to help you realize your vision.'
p2639
aS'Amy transformed the Hacienda into an amazing oasis, complete with white papel picados strung across the dance floor with a canopy of sparkling lights. The tables were adorned with mercury vases filled with peonies, flickering candles, and gold polka dotted napkins to wipe the crumbs of the homemade churros dipped in chocolate and carmel sauce. We created our own maracas favors, name tags, and custom burlap signs with the help of our bridal party and mothers in order to infuse some of our own style. The evening entertainment included a mariachi band at cocktails, followed by a cigar roller, camera booth and midnight popsicles for those needing a cool down from the all the dancing.'

S'Destination weddings are always dreamy, but an intimate destination wedding in Provence? That enters an entirely new level of lovely. This stunning soiree captured by Sages Comme des Images is just overflowing with so much pretty I can barely stand it, and you can get lost in every gorgeous moment right here.'
p2691
aS'From the Bride After our engagement, we quickly realized that a destination wedding best fit our idea of a perfect intimate wedding. It didn t take us long to decide that Provence, France was the place that we wanted to have our special day. The stone houses with blue shutters and field of lavender were part of my dream. Le Petit Hameau in St. Remy de Provence was a gorgeous venue found by our amazing planners and it was exactly what I dreamed of!'
p2692
aS'Our wedding was attended our closest friends and immediate family members to keep a very intimate setting. Our guests arrived several days before the wedding and the group took several day trips to see the sites of Provence. It meant so much that everyone took the time to spend the week with us, in addition to our special day.'
p2693
aS'Despite a forecast of thunderstorms on wedding day, the skies cleared after a rain shower thirty minutes before the ceremony began and we were able to keep my dream of having an outdoor wedding ceremony in the garden with roses and rows of lavender. Our cocktail hour had lawn games such as croquet and French petanque, with French jazz manouche music to infuse the French touches that I wanted our wedding to reflect. Instead of a wedding cake, we had a macaron tower with sparklers since they are my favorite dessert. Our favors were bars of French soap from Marseille and were a nice item for everyone to bring back home after their trip.'
p2694
aS'Working with a planner was the best decision we made after deciding on a venue in France. Not speaking the language or knowing how to find vendors made them critical to having a stress-free day and seeing my dream wedding come to life!\n'

It s the colors, the culture and the rich, rich history that have my heart, and won t let go. Momentus Special Events planned the whole destination day to perfection with Vanessa Velez was there to capture, and you ll find much more right over here!'
p2720
aS'From the Bride  We decided to get married in Puerto Rico because we have a passion for traveling. We have always talked about having a destination wedding and we wanted a location that was close to the U.S, but would not require our guests to get a passport. We have friends who spoke very highly of Puerto Rico. They raved about the food, the beaches, the people, the activities, etc. So, we decided to give it a shot. After further research, we fell in love with the hotels and quest reviews of other brides and couples. Seeing pictures of Old San Juan, sealed the deal. You cannot create that setting any where and we knew we wanted to have Old San Juan as a background for our pictures.'
p2721
aS'Our inspiration for the day was focused around intimacy. We wanted to have a small intimate ceremony/wedding that focused on nothing but us, our vows, our close family, and friends. We wanted everyone who was there to actually feel our love. You can tell we accomplished this by the sounds of people sniffling because there was not 1 dry eye in the crowd.'
p2722
aS'Having a Spring wedding, I fell in love with the coral/aqua color palette. To me, these colors screamed  destination  and went so well with Old San Juan. They reminded me of the colors of the buildings. The color theme was all about a romantic, vintage/rustic look. I wanted to have colors that were not your traditional wedding colors. Having the girls in 2 different colors and different dresses inspired them to be themselves and to be comfortable.'
p2723
aS'The groomsman s suits played off the color of the girls dresses. I wanted to the dresses to stand out against the khaki color. Also, our taste is very  vintage . Our home is decorated the same way. There is something about it, that screams intimacy and love. For our ceremony, we went very simple because once again we wanted to have that Old San Juan background. It wasn t about flowers or decorations, but more about our moment and wedding. Simple is sometimes better!\n'

aS'From the Bride Jed and I met in Honolulu at a small networking event put together by a mutual friend. By the end of the evening we exchanged numbers and just a few days later went out on our first date. Seven months later, Jed, a self professed bachelor for life, and I found ourselves in the mountain town of Hakone, Japan. It was there, surrounded by breathtaking scenery, that Jed got down on one knee and, taking me by complete surprise, proposed.'
p2751
aS'The first and easiest decision we made as a newly engaged couple was to choose my family s beach house at Maha ulepu on Kaua i as the location for both the ceremony and the reception. The Gillin Beach House has been in my family for four generations and is where Id always dreamed Id get married. Private and unique with a white sandy beach at its doorstep, nestled in a lush valley and flanked by beautiful Mount Ha upu, Maha ulepu is breathtakingly beautiful, close to our hearts, and encompassed everything we wanted in a wedding venue. We wanted to do most of the planning ourselves, but we knew that wed need the help of a wedding coordinator leading up to and for the big day. We enlisted the help of Morgan Childs and her team at Moana Events who seamlessly took over the planning the month prior and were, as anticipated, an indispensable part of our wedding. Confident that Morgan understood our vision, we were able to relax and trust that during our big day, everything would be taken care of.'
p2752
aS'As we began planning, our main priority was to be surrounded by the people we love. We chose to keep things relatively simple but sophisticated, focusing on the food, flowers and small details that incorporated our personalities and passions. As for the theme, we wanted the tone of the wedding to be one of understated elegance and for everything to highlight the natural beauty of Maha ulepu. We worked closely with the team at Martin and Roberts Design on our flowers and event design and dcor. Together we came up with a warm, neutral color pallet of creams and whites, accented by gold, soft pinks and greens. From the ivory and champagne colored specialty linens and lounge furniture to the abundance of pink and cream peonies and everything in between, they helped us make the day both visually stunning and functionally comfortable.'
p2753
aS'When it came to finding my wedding dress, I searched every bridal store in Hawaii with no success, and eventually ended up finding the one while on a trip to San Francisco. An ivory gown by Marisa, it had a structured fit draped with soft, silk chiffon and, most importantly, it wasn t heavy or hot. My bridesmaids and our flower girl wore dresses from JCrew in dusty shale and ivory, respectively. Because we were getting married on the beach in Hawaii, Jed and his groomsmen all wore leather slippers (flip flops or sandals) with their beige pants and ivory shirts. As is the custom with weddings in Hawaii, Jed and his groomsmen all wore special lei made of maile, ferns and other greenery. The girls and I carried bouquets of peonies and had flowers tucked into our hair. I loved my bouquet so much I kept it for an entire week and even took it as far as California before my husband informed me that I could not, in fact, take it with me to Italy on our honeymoon.'
p2754
aS'I designed the invitations, which were printed locally on Kauai. I wanted them to echo the same simple yet sophisticated tone of our wedding design and dcor, and so, with the exception of the map to our wedding location and our save the date card, everything was printed in dark brown ink on heavy cream-colored linen paper. For contrast I tied each invitation bundle with gold and cream baker s twine and I hand-lined the inside of each invitation and RSVP envelope with a specialty paper printed with a design of gold mums. We included a link to our wedding website that served as a guide to Kaua i for all of our out-of-town guests. As a nod to my and Jeds love of wine, we used wine corks as chopstick rests, to prop up the table numbers, and also as the escort card holders on the welcome table. We used wooden wine boxes for our cards on the gift table, and also on the various food station tables. Instead of decorating the food stations with flowers, we used bouquets of mixed herbs arranged in mason jars by my mom and her friends a few days before the wedding.'
p2755
aS'After several rainy (and worrisome) days we woke up on our wedding day to absolutely spectacular weather. Along with my bridesmaids, mom and mothers-in-law, I got my hair and makeup done at the LAB Salon in Kalaheo while Jed and his groomsmen golfed at the Grand Hyatt. Just before the wedding began, Jed and I met at the historic Koloa sugar mill for our first look. The words It all started here are painted under a rainbow on an old silo, so it only seemed appropriate that we incorporate it into the beginning of our new lives together. Our amazing photographer, Blenda Montoro Miller of Blenda Montoro Photography, was so easy to work with. She had taken our engagement photos, so the wedding day was easy because we already felt so comfortable with her behind the lens. Always prepared, Blenda brought several props such as the hand painted Just Married sign, as well as a ladder so that she could get the perfect angles for my tall groom.'
p2756
aS'We exchanged our vows on the beach with just two rows of chairs separated by an aisle sprinkled with white orchids, and the ocean as our backdrop. Afterward, on the front lawn overlooking the sparkling blue ocean and with the sun setting over the mountains, our guests were serenaded with live, classic Hawaiian music, enjoyed passed hors d oeuvres, and sipped on inventive cocktails created by our two master mixologists. After we made our grand entrance into the dining tent, I surprised Jed, and everyone else, by dancing a hula that I had learned just for the occasion. Michelle from Zest Kauai was our videographer and we were so lucky to have her there capturing every moment throughout the evening.'
p2757
aS'The food was one of the highlights of the night. Mark Oyama and his team at Contemporary Flavors created, and perfectly executed, a custom menu that perfectly showcased all of our favorite cuisines. Six different stations were set up around the property, each offering guests small plates of everything from fresh oysters and sashimi, Mediterranean and Asian inspired tapas to grilled filet mignon and fresh fish. For dessert, my favorite, we had an array of options including prosecco sabayon, dark chocolate fondue, passion fruit whoopie pies, and our carrot flavored wedding cake. To complement the food we had a wonderful selection of red and white wines as well as beer that was perfectly chilled in special Beer Below Zero freezers.'
p2758
aS'Softly lit by white paper lanterns, uplit coconut trees and strings of cafe lights, the mood of the night was festive and intimate. We spent the rest of the evening dancing the night away under the stars with our family and friends to the music provided by our DJ Mike of Kustom Sounds Kauai. The festivities ended with a surprise fire works show put on by one of our guests and was truly the perfect end to a most perfect day. As a token of our love and appreciation, guests went home with samples of our favorite Kaua i-made treats: honey, coffee, chocolate dipped macadamia nuts, sea salt, and my moms homemade mango chutney.'

aS'From the Bride  Our wedding day was absolutely beyond any dream I could have had. Getting there, however, was an absolute disaster. Everything that could go wrong did. From my husband almost not being allowed on the plane (check your passport expiry dates!), to the Portuguese consulate s system breaking almost preventing us from getting our marriage licence, to hospital visits and missing table numbers. We somehow made it through and were surrounded by amazing people making it unforgettable. We were lucky enough to find wonderful people to help us through the process. We could not have done it without Gra a the hotel manager and our photographers Kerry and Luis who kept us sane.'
p2786
aS'We had an intimate wedding of 44 people in the beautiful Pousada Santa Maria do Bouro in Amares, a 12th century monastery. We felt at peace once we found it. Everything fell into place after that. We wanted to let the natural beauty of the place speak for itself so we had minimal decor of white and green flowers, with some touches of orange throughout to echo the oranges trees we were surrounded by. Our vision for the wedding was a simple we wanted an elegant retreat where we can shower our loved ones with the things we love best in life: good food, good music, good wine, and good company. It was hard to keep our numbers small, but essential for our vision.'
p2787
aS'The ceremony was under a canopy built by my parents, we brought the bamboo from Canada and the traditional Jewish tallit was my father s which was tied on top. The aisles were lined with Hydrangeas, the flower of the Azores, where Jos  was born. The mountains did the rest. My husband s best friend David translated the Portuguese civil ceremony and we had a humanist rabbi for the Jewish ceremony. The ceremony ended with an impromptu eferria (chant) from Coimbra. It was magical.'
p2788
aS' Our passion in life is food, so we searched far and wide for the best chef in Portugal to create our dream menu. We ditched the wedding cake and had a 6 course dinner instead. We also wanted to spend time with all of our guests so we decided to eat one course with each table. It was perfect, always too fast, but we really got to enjoy the evening with everyone and it was a great reset button to make sure that we remembered every moment of the wedding. After dinner we danced the night (and morning) away. Our band even learnt the traditional Jewish celebration song Chava Nagila. The evening was a perfect combination of Jos  and I, and our two cultures. We loved every moment of it.'
p2789
aS'Our day was everything we hoped for, and it would not have happened if we did not stick to our vision of what we wanted. Staying true to who you are as an individual, and couple, is the most important advice I could give. That, and being grateful for the day itself no matter what happens.\n'

The gorgeous sandy beaches, the beautiful grounds of Dreams Los Cabos Golf Suite & Spa Resort, the fabulous florals from Florenta Flower Design - every image captured by Mirelle Carmichael is a destination dream come true, and you can see every bit of this beautiful wedding right here in the full gallery.'
p2813
aS'From the Bride After the fairytale wedding proposal that involved a skydiving jump with  Will you marry me  spelled out on the ground as I was landing, I knew that Craig and I had to have a fabulous wedding to match that memorable moment. Being each from different coasts (Craig originating from Maryland, and I from California); we set out to find a location that would enable all of our closest friends and family to be a part of our special day. So instead of getting everyone to a central location in the U.S., we decided that a destination would be the perfect fit a wedding and a vacation all in one! Randomly, we separately came up with the idea of a wedding in Mexico, and Cabo San Lucas seemed to fit all of our requirements with location, weather, and hotel options. We had previously stayed at a Dreams Resort in Punta Cana, and discovered they had a resort in Cabo. It was a match made in heaven! So plans went underway, and we enlisted the help of a local wedding planner in our current home state of North Carolina, Wil Kiser with Blue-17 Designs. Wil helped us to not only coordinate with the hotel, but he additionally worked on finding us the multiple vendors that made our day exceptional.'
p2814
aS' Our photographer, Mirelle Carmichael with Mirelle Carmichael Photography, was the first vendor that I knew that I HAD to have be part of our wedding. I had been following her work through her website for awhile, and I knew that there was no one else who I d rather be there in Cabo with us, capturing the moments that we would treasure for a lifetime. Mirelle not only worked tirelessly throughout the wedding day ensuring that my long list of requested shots were fulfilled, she also did a mini-engagement shoot, as well as took photos of the rehearsal bonfire and dinner. Her professionalism and expertise with destination weddings made her an invaluable addition to our wedding. I show off the pictures to anyone who is willing to look on a regular basis!'
p2815
aS' Lola with Florenta Flower Design worked very closely with me from afar through multiple emails and telephone meetings. I had a definite vision of the type of shabby chic, yet elegant wedding that I wanted to have, and Lola worked relentlessly to ensure that I got exactly what I wanted. The flowers were absolutely gorgeous, the ceremony and reception d cor were impeccable, and I was able to see my vision for this special day come together in such a magical way. Our DJ, Ricardo Patino, was in a word, awesome. I had compiled a list of must-have songs for the reception (who doesn t NEED a little  Teach Me How to Dougie  at their wedding), and Ricardo was able to complement our chosen songs with other popular and current songs. The flow of the entire event was flawless, and all of our guests walked away that night with multiple songs stuck in their heads, and not wanting to leave.'
p2816
aS' The group of girls at Suzanne Morel that prepared our hair and makeup for us were absolutely remarkable. Being the picky person I am, I met up with Suzanne and her crew the day before the wedding for a run through as I wanted to ensure that the intricate hair style I was requesting could be completed. Suzanne put my mind at ease with a whip of her brush, and I left there feeling fabulous, and thrilled as to how I would look on my wedding day. The day of the wedding, every single one of my bridesmaids was pampered and felt like movie stars, with their hair pinned up just right, and exactly as requested in the pictures we provided.'
p2817
aS' And what wedding is complete without the ever popular photo booth? Dino Gomez Photography arrived at the wedding with one of the biggest photo booths we had ever seen, with an assortment of props. The large television screens that were a part of the package were awesome, as they allowed the guests to view the pictures that were being taken throughout the night.'
p2818
aS' While all of these vendors aided in making Craig and my wedding the best day of our life, Dreams Los Cabos is the definite front runner in our minds in regards to the success of our wedding week. We arrived to a beautiful landscape and a bounty of staff that were eager to aide us in whatever requests we had. Mariana, our wedding coordinator for the resort, worked endlessly to ensure that all of our plans were set in place, that our guests were enjoying their stay, and that our wedding was one to be talked about for decades to come. Our wedding was impeccable, and the staff at Dreams Los Cabos were the main ones to thank for that. Now all we have to do is plan a yearly reunion back to those magnificent beaches of Los Cabos!\n'

The Brides family resides in the Burgundy region and it was a fantastic opportunity to have a destination wedding in a country which they both love and have admired for many years.'
p2872
aS'The Chateau des Condes in Vallery, France is a very historical estate which dates back to the 16th century and many notable weddings and events have taken place in this magical castle. Mette and Thomas chose to have their wedding celebration outside under the Sycamore tree, being as they are huge nature lovers, and hence came the theme of their wedding stationary. A traditional Norwegian ceremony was performed by a priest underneath the sprawling tree and beautiful folk music accompanied the day, thanks to various guests. White and green flowers with simple candle light is the theme throughout the day and all fine things that are French were greatly enjoyed through out the day, from the Pierre Herme macarons to the Cartier special edition Champagne, this wedding was classy, and elegant down to the last details.'
p2873
aS'The love between the couple comes through in many of the images and I am thrilled to have captured so many intimate glances between the bridal party and the couple throughout the day. The maid of honour sang a touching romantic song during the ceremony that brought a tear to just about everyones eyes. Not to mention the best man s rendition of a classic song during the reception which made the groom grin from ear to ear.'

aS'From McKenzie Miller Films  In March of this year, Kim and Bryan gathered with 30 of their closest friends and family for an intimate and fun weekend at the Westin in Cabo San Lucas. Kim was actually the winner of the last season of Survivor, and Brian and her began dating just before she left for nine weeks on a deserted island. During their ceremony, Kim and Bryan had each of their guests give a piece of advice or well wishes and Kim s fellow castmate commented that she knew it was the real deal when filming wrapped and Bryan wasn t afraid to kiss Kim after she hadn t brushed her teeth for almost two months!'
p2904
aS'The weekend was magical from start to finish. On Friday night all of the guests set sail for a whale watching cruise and saw enormous humpback whales jumping insanely close to the boat. The wedding day was just as relaxed as Kim and Bryan are together. They started off playing a game of volleyball (which is how they first met) and swimming together with their friends. About an hour before ceremony time, they made their way to different rooms to get ready. After an intimate first look in the tiny cove where the ceremony would take place, their guests made their way down and circled around the two while they said their vows. The night ended with an intimate dinner on the beach.'

aS'From the Bride  Derek and I met when we were 18-years-old on the first day of college and instantly bonded over similar senses of humor, a love of electronic music, and an affinity for late-night diner food. We started out as neighbors, but quickly became inseparable. To the surprise of no one, we ve been close friends ever since (Who says you can t marry your first love?!). We dated on and off through college and finally, after being on for five years and having lived in four different cities, decided to officially keep building a life together.'
p2972
aS'My Dad has always spoken nostalgically about his time stationed in Hawaii during his young years in the military (In fact, I think that s where his love of coconut and playing the ukulele comes from). He s wanted to revisit the islands and bring my Mom, but of course life   and an all day flight   always managed to get in the way. A few years ago, they were planning to fly to Hawaii for their 20th wedding anniversary, but that was during the economic downturn, so regrettably, they didn t end up making it  until now. Derek and I were so thrilled to give them (and our other guests) a special excuse to get out to the Islands and also feel so lucky that we got to share in my Mom s first trip to and Dad s return to Hawaii. The entire trip   including our wedding day   was so special for my parents. One of our favorite moments was when, as is a custom in Hawaiian culture, Derek placed leis around my parents  necks (and I did the same for his Mom), at the beginning of our wedding ceremony signifying our families coming together.'
p2973
aS'Derek and I recently moved to the West Coast, but there are many cities on either coast that we could call home. After moving from place to place and traveling together so much, we ve learned that the thing that makes your home a home is being surrounded by people you love. For our wedding, we decided on a meaningful destination that would allow the people we love to take a break from their busy lives and share in a vacation and our love of travel with us. We got engaged in Oahu and fell in love with the laid-back and romantic atmosphere so much that we wanted to share it with our family and friends back East. It was important to find a venue that was a reflection of Derek and myself, so we wanted to find a place close to a city (we love cities!), but also, since I grew up on and around the Chesapeake Bay, close to the sea. This made beautiful Lanikuhonua a natural choice! It truly is  where heaven meets earth !'
p2974
aS'Our wedding drew from a lot of what Derek and I and our friends and family love and share in in our daily lives. We weren t afraid to take some chances in mixing together passions from different places, eras, and parts of our life to really make the wedding ours. During our wedding planning, we tried to steer away from tradition for the sake of tradition or anything to which we didn t feel a personal connection   skipping on seating plans, a long ceremony, a traditional wedding cake, first dances, and other formalities. Instead, we focused on the fun and ease of an intimate celebration just for us and our close friends and family.'
p2975
aS'Some components of the wedding were very location-based and locally-inspired such as the Hawaiian music and hula performances, fire knife dancing performances, gifts of orchid leis, and food options such as the shave ice, while other components were inspired by different parts of our lives, like our love of design, technology, play, travel, and food. Creative personal touches were added through paper goods that I designed and put together myself or with design flourishes found while browsing in our local city of Seattle or on arts and crafts sites like Etsy.'
p2976
aS'Since our wedding was in Hawaii, we took full advantage of the fact people were vacationing and ready to have fun before, during, and after the event. Derek and I met our guests as they arrived on the Oahu which allowed us to catch up and go road tripping, snorkeling, beach walking, surfing, bar hopping and sunbathing before the ceremony. My parents also hosted a  Welcome to Hawaii  cocktail hour which allowed our guests to get acquainted if they weren t already, or catch up before the big day. Perhaps the most memorable activity in which several of our friends partook was skydiving over the North Shore the day after the ceremony.'
p2977
aS'Many of the guests have never been to Hawaii so we wanted to give them a fun Hawaiian welcome. Each guest received an orchid lei and souvenir images of themselves from the photo booth. Derek and I also didn t want to burden our guests with fuller suitcases on the way home   so we made a donation to a digital rights group on their behalf.'
p2978
aS'We wanted our wedding gifts for our parties to be practical but also special reminders of their time in Hawaii that would be used more than once. The bridesmaids received beautiful jewelry from Tiffany s that matched their tastes and personalities. The groomsmen received Wayfarers because who doesn t need vintage sunglasses in Hawaii? They also received custom made key chains personalized with their initials inscribed in binary which was an endearing a personal touch on the part of Derek, a self-proclaimed nerd.'
p2979
aS'The theme was a bit of beach plus Hawaiian culture with a dash of garden party. We were looking to celebrate our past, present and future lives together, so we mixed styles, eras, personal traditions and interests. The music was a wonderful local artist playing traditional Hawaiian music with the accompaniment of Hula dancers that created a romantic atmosphere and brought touches of beautiful Hawaiian culture to the wedding. We also had a fire knife dancer that added a lot of energy and overall awesomeness to the reception.'
p2980
aS'Visually, we decided on a beach-inspired, but romantic color palette in mint green, sandy gray and peach with lots of geometric and contrasting organic texture. The full, luscious flowers in the bouquets as well as on the tables were chosen to compliment the other design elements and match the shape and texture of my wedding gown. We also chose table settings which would accentuate the whimsy and romance of the day by using chevron runners and several different vessels for lush florals. I also adore the romantic but fierce Ghost Chairs we used that, like our wedding, are a mixture of both new and old style.'
p2981
aS'Derek and I both love food, so we wanted to get away from the whole idea that wedding food needs to be inaccessible or mass-produced and went with local chefs cooking simply and naturally with great local ingredients, infusing our event with additional Hawaiian flavor. From the pupus to the several course dinner, we wanted to provide people with approachable but upscale choices, sometimes offering bar food options like pork sliders, evoking the sense that you re at a family gathering or cookout. Derek and I brought specialty bottles of cachaca to Hawaii for our signature beverage, a mint-colored caipirinha, that was presented in mason jars with decorative straws.'
p2982
aS'We also decided on a dessert table with several cupcake flavors and a delightful shaved ice station which are both options you might see at an outdoor party or Hawaiian event. The beautiful cake was a simple chevron design with a whimsical bloom while the cupcakes were adorned with striped flags.'
p2983
aS'Finally, I think a big theme of the wedding had to be adventure. All the wonderful people who showed up to the wedding who travelled halfway around the world and made the day so fabulous came because they are not afraid of an adventure!'
p2984
aS'As a visual and interaction designer, I knew from the get go there were important visual details I wanted to attend to myself for the wedding day, but there were a lot of ideas that I didn t know how to articulate yet (or weren t even on my radar).'
p2985
aS'Michelle and I work wonderfully as a team. She s good at keeping track of the big picture and small details and presenting/articulating the design space and all of the options to us. It was important for us to find a wedding planner whose taste aligned with ours since planning from afar can be a huge challenge and it s not hands-on in the same way that other brides experience. We weren t able to meet with any of our vendors until a week prior to the wedding, so we trusted in Michelle s expertise when it came to making recommendations. Also, since we don t have any prior experience with wedding planning, she became our guide in all things related to weddings. Michelle did a beautiful job of being flexible, listening and responding to us and presenting us with the right people who matched the vision we developed together at the beginning. Finally, working with Michelle meant she gave me the freedom to input my own ideas and design the elements that were important to me, which really helped us to teamwork to bring life to the original vision.'
p2986
aS'From Michelle Garibay Events  Working with Kari and Derek on their destination wedding was such a joy! They are true dream clients. They were both equally involved in the planning process but each had their specific priorities and in the end, everything came together beautifully! Kari and I hit it off from the first phone call and designing a wedding where the bride had such an eye for design and detail, made my job fun and easy. We were both so excited when we met for the first time after our 11 month partnership just one day before the wedding!'
p2987
aS'Kari had a specific vision for their wedding so I assembled a top notch team of vendors to bring everything to fruition. She loved the romantic, muted tones of peach, seafoam and gray but also wanted a touch of contemporary elegance. The floral designs and chandeliers were more vintage in style and we added some more modern pieces in the ghost chairs and lounge furniture. I paid homage to her graphic design background and incorporated a bolder chevron print into her table runners and cake. Kari s playful side was reflected in more whimsical elements like the Viewfinder save the date (which was super adorable!) and her paper elements, like the cupcake flags and paper straws for their signature cocktail, the Caipirinha. Kari even designed her own invitation suite and menu cards!'
p2988
aS'Along with the d cor, food and the guest experience was very important to them and Chef Peter blew everyone away with the 5 course plated menu. Everything tasted as amazing as it looked. From the seared scallops to the melt in your mouth pork shoulder, service and presentation were impeccable. Such a superstar team to work with!'
p2989
aS'This is one of those weddings that us consultants dream about a fun and stylish wedding vision, a super cool and head over heels in love couple, in synch and on the same wave length throughout the planning process and beautifully orchestrated wedding day from start to finish with rave reviews   and in Hawaii   who could complain about that?'

aS'From the photographer  Charlene and Luigi met in Buenos Aires, Argentina after becoming dance partners with the hope of mastering the passionate tango dance. From the moment Luigi met Charlene, it became a mission of his to get to know her. This bride made her groom work for her affection and he quickly proved to be her knight in shining armor after their first date.'
p3034
aS'The couple s wedding day took place in the romantic and historic city of Rome, Italy, with a Catholic ceremony at Santa Maria dei Miracoli and a reception at Castello di Torcrescenza. Personal touches were added to their wedding by incorporating some of their favorite things. Charlene loves the vintage appeal that lace evokes so she had custom-made lace overlays displayed across the reception tables. The couple also has a love for limoncello so they ordered bottles of them from the Amalfi coast and gave them away as wedding favors.'
p3035
aS'There were countless moments from the day that made their wedding magical. They arranged a traditional tea ceremony before the wedding to honor Charlene s family and culture. After tying the knot, the newlyweds came full circle with how they first met and did the tango as their first dance. Not only did their friends and family witness these two becoming lifelong partners, but they also saw them become lifelong dance partners!'
p3036
aS'Charlene and Luigi s dream of having their destination wedding came true with the company of their friends and family. There are many details to consider when planning a destination wedding, but Charlene encourages future brides to not stress the small stuff. Regardless of how prepared you are, things will always go unplanned, but it does not mean your special day will be anything less than perfection.\n'

aS'From the Bride  The love story of Jay & Amy hark back to 2004 when they met each other at Sentosa beach in Singapore. Warm sunshine, soothing sea breeze and the blue ocean as the backdrop of where their paths crossed. 7 years later, destiny finds its way back to these two lovebirds in the isles of Greece. Their craziness about each other overpowered the air around. 5 months later, Jay followed his heart, flew to Singapore and proposed to Amy. Her answer sealed their way to happiness and happily ever after.'
p3053
aS'Why the theme  Breeze from the Aegean Sea  We fell in love on the Greek Islands where everything is blue and white there. So we wanted our wedding to reminisce the place where our love blossomed. An intimate affair filled only with the people we love most in a beautiful setting for the perfect, unrushed reunion, there is surely nothing better than to have it on the cliff-top overlooking the Indian Ocean. And to have all the decoration and details in blue and white.'

And for the small details i wanted to DIY myself so that i can keep these crafts and pass it on to my future children such as: ring pillow, unity candles, bridesmaids  corsages, floral crowns, invitation cards, thank you cards, escort cards, table menu. It was so much fun doing them!'
p3055
aS'The wedding day turned out to be exactly how i have imagined it for the past year. It was so romantic, enchanting and fairy-tale like. Although we had many friends and family with us that day, we still felt like we were in a bubble of our own. If I could, I wish to re-live that day once more!\n'

It s basically a rustic meets elegant dream come true, complete with fab paper goods from Freshly Minted, a One Sweet Slice masterpiece and all kinds of awesome moments captured by Chudleigh Weddings.  See them all here.'
p3113
aS'From Michelle Leo Events  Chad and Beth were a delightful couple to work with. Residing in Tennessee, they contacted me to help them plan their destination wedding where they originally met and fell in love: Park City, Utah.'
p3114
aS'Park City is a gorgeous location and its landscape is beyond stunning- especially in the late summer/early fall season. In addition, Look Out Cabin sits appropriately at the top of the lovely Canyon s Resort and provides its visitors with a stunning 360 degree, panoramic view of the Rocky Mountains as far as the eye can see.'
p3115
aS'Beth and Chad wanted to focus on keeping their wedding intimate, cozy, and elegant. I immediately fell in love with Beth s request to incorporate gold in her wedding design. Her wedding gown had a lovely gold sash that criss-crossed in the back and the dress is what started it all when it came to selecting her sophisticated, jewel-tone color pallet.'
p3116
aS'The couple selected Labor Day weekend for their wedding festivities and flew all 40 of their guests out for their celebration. Their wedding fell right on the cusp of when the colors of the landscape would begin to change into a bright display of fall foliage. So with this in mind, I decided to incorporate warm colors into their pallet such as eggplant, fig, navy, gold and blush. I wanted to work with a color pallet that would emphasize and compliment the already beautiful landscape, not compete with it.'
p3117
aS'Before arriving at the wedding location, guests were served a flute of champagne at the bottom of the ski lift (because the resort sits at the top of the mountain, all guests enjoyed a 20-minute scenic view of the resort as their chair lift climbed in elevation before dropping them off at the top).'
p3118
aS'The ceremony itself was unique and meaningful. The brides  brother officiated the wedding with few words. He expressed to the couple the importance of listening closely to the love they shared and emphasized that listening often requires not talking. Therefore, much of the ceremony was read on large posters that her brother held up for guests to read which allowed the silence of these moments to have a stunning and meaningful impact on all in attendance. As a wedding planner, I see many ceremonies and Chad and Beth s was one I ll never forget. Another unique moment included a brief rain shower just moments before the ceremony was to begin. We held off the ceremony (for about 10 mins) and the storm quickly passed leaving behind a double rainbow right before Beth headed down the aisle. It was gorgeous.'
p3119
aS'Because this was an intimate wedding with only 40 guests, the plated dinner took place at one large king s table that spanned the length of Look Out Cabin s beautiful, south-facing deck. The view of the Rockies was gorgeous and the table design was equally stunning. With navy satin linens, gold chiavari chairs and eggplant chair sashes (tied in a lovely rosette), the table was the epitome of mountain elegance. Gold chargers cradled menus mounted on eggplant paper, and a mix of gold and amber vessels of various heights, shapes and sizes boasted gorgeous blooms in blush, eggplant, blues, rusts in a variety of splendid textures.'
p3120
aS'Guests dined on delicious appetizers and then enjoyed a four-course meal followed by dessert: a three-tier wedding cake covered in gold, stenciled fondant, filled with moist white cake and vanilla bean custard. The rest of the night consisted of dancing the night away on the deck under the stars (at this high up on the mountain, there s really no light pollution so guests enjoyed a spectacular view of the Milky Way).'
p3121
aS'Other little details that made the day special included personalized water bottles, and a  mail station  for the sign in table where guests had the opportunity to send the couple a pre-stamped postcard from Utah that included their best marriage advice. And guests raved about the adirondack chairs and fire pits along the perimeter of the deck where they could soak up the views while enjoying delicious bite-sized appetizers. I m particularly smitten with the  first look  session that took place prior to the ceremony. Some of my favorite shots of the day are a result of their first look.'
p3122
aS'Overall, I m smitten with how simplistic, and yet, elegant and memorable this day was; I am so thrilled I was able to be a part of it.'

S'My husband will tell you, I don t talk about much else but the Cotswolds when vacation dreaming lately. It s so quaint, beautiful, and perfect and this wedding from Tory Williams Photography is doing wonders spurring on my wanderlust. It s the epitome of pretty, and it s all right here!'
p3165
aS'From the bride  Although I grew up in London, I had always wanted to get married in the Cotswolds   something about the quaint villages and beautiful country houses felt so romantic. In a twist of fortune, we moved to the area three years ago with a change in jobs and after my husband proposed last year, we were lucky enough to have some amazing wedding venues on our doorstep. We chose to get married in Barnsley House, a beautiful Country House Hotel with its fantastic gardens   as soon as we saw it, we fell in love. It was perfect.'
p3166
aS'We wanted the feel of the day to be simple and understated and the cosy country house reception rooms, were all tastefully decorated with a shabby chic charm and filled with natural garden flowers that made us feel like we were stepping into a family home, not a luxury spa hotel. We were married on a beautiful English summer s day (a rarity!) in August, in the gardens, under a large oak tree surrounded by one hundred of our closest friends and family.'
p3167
aS'Drinks & Canap s followed the service on the lawns, accompanied by the sound of our string trio. The flower arrangements and bouquets were in keeping with the natural colours of the Barnsley House gardens and all of the paper goods were designed to include a dash of the Cotswolds green/Eau de Nil which closely matched the colour of the bridesmaids dresses. Hanging from an old tree, was a large picture frame that displayed our table seating plan   each table number was attached via string which floated gently in the breeze. A cocktail bar was set up in the garden temple & we cut the cake as husband and wife as the sun set over the Cotswolds.'
p3168
aS'The evening was filled with dancing and laughter and our guests captured the mood of the night with our take on the traditional guest book   a photo board. The smiles caught on film meant a lot more than words in a book   memories that we can treasure forever.'

p3185
aS'From Anouschka Rokebrand Photography  Lotte and Wesley are people who enjoy life. They love good food, wine and travelling. So for their wedding they chose one of the top venues in The Netherlands with amazing food: De Librije in Zwolle. It s also a hotel so the happy couple stayed there the night before so all preparations could take place there, as well.'
p3186
aS'Lotte had two dresses, one classical one for the Saturday and a short and modern one for the Sunday brunch. The colours for the day were white with a touch of silver. Lotte s silver Louboutins would make any girl swoon!'
p3187
aS'The ceremony took place at a beautiful old Hall located in the Library of Zwolle, everything else was at De Librije. The ceremony was very personal, with speeches and songs by the parents and a wonderful officiant. Wesley had rented an old timer Bentley to transport them between the venues.'
p3188
aS'For the dining tables they had lots of white floral centerpieces, white ribbons in the room and the placecards were winecorks. Very fitting for people who love wine!'
p3189
aS'The tables all had names of different kinds of wines/champagne so the theme continued throughout the dining room. For the brunch the theme was the South of France so the table names had changed to cities in the South of France on the Sunday morning and the tables were decorated with shells and white centerpieces.'
p3190
aS'Their guestbook contained photos of all their guests and they could write a personal message next to their photo.'
p3191
aS'For the first dance they opted for a very original song:  Scream and Shout  by Will.I.Am and Britney Spears. It got the party started right away. The DJ was accompanied by a live saxophone player, a great touch to any party!'

S'To say I was obsessed with this stunning Florence f te at Villa Montefiano Garden would be the understatement of the year. It s literally dripping in pretty, making each and every image captured by Studio A+Q like a dream. So do yourself a favor today and set aside to get lost in all the lovely here. '

aS'From the Bride From the moment we started planning our wedding, we knew we wanted to have it in Italy. I am in American who met her future Italian husband in a pub in Florence. We fell in love over quick trips for gelato, cheesy American films dubbed in Italian, and walks around our favorite Florentine neighborhoods. When we got engaged, it seemed only natural that we would celebrate our marriage in the place where we met, fell in love, and now call home together.'
p3219
aS'When we started looking at venues, our main objective was to find something where we could hold both our ceremony and reception, with plenty of outdoor space to enjoy the beautiful, late-summer climate of Tuscany. Villa Montefiano, a 16th century residence nestled on a hillside overlooking Florence, was the perfect fit. Not only was the villa itself gorgeous, but it offered a number of lush gardens and terraces that we could utilize for our celebration.'
p3220
aS'While neither of us had a particular theme for the wedding, I wanted it to be soft and romantic with just a touch of Great Gatsby elegance. My husband just wanted good food and an American-style wedding cake. Our brilliant wedding planner, Rossana took all of our ideas and created an evening that flawlessly melded together the best of our American and Italian traditions. Every detail from the floral arrangements and candles to the confetti table and intimate seating groups perfectly reflected our vision for the wedding.'
p3221
aS'Our ceremony took place just before sunset; the golden light, gentle breeze, and Tuscan backdrop created an almost ethereal effect. My husband said his vows in Italian and I said mine in English. It not only made the ceremony understandable for both Italian and English-speaking guests, but also gave us the opportunity to express something so meaningful to one another in our first languages. I remember feeling so happy to have married such a wonderful man, surrounded by our loved ones above the city where it all began.\n'

aS'From Emma Rodrigues Photography Jordan & Brett are from the United States and after a first wedding in NYC they decided to get married in one of the most beautiful village of France : Gordes ! Thirty-ish people came along in a wonderful, charming place, Font Blanche, where they spend a whole week surrounded with their family and closest friends. We gathered on a Wednesday for their wedding celebration in the chapel of Gordes which Jordan choose because it reminded her of the one in the movie Romeo & Juliette (yes the one with Leonardo Di Caprio!).\n '
p3248
aS'I have to say that Jordan is a real artist and it s actually her job, she imagined the guest table, brought accessories from New-York and made the place cards. She also made her veil and belt!'
p3249
aS' It was a favorite wedding and adventure ! Jordan & Brett trusted me despite our cultural difference & they included us as real guests. It was an amazing day, the atmosphere, the place, the people  everything was there to make it a perfect day filled with laughter, tears, stories and a good meal from the south of France!\n'

aS'From the cinematographer  Matt and Lisa are two professional wedding photographers who met by chance one day and found an immediate connection. Lisa had always dreamed of going to Paris, and her dreams came true in more than one way when she married the love of her life, Matt in sight of the Eiffel Tower at the St. James Hotel. The ceremony included only the couple, the photographer, videographer, and enraptured on-lookers who thought they were famous! They celebrated with the tradition of adding a personalized lock to the Ponts des Arts, throwing away the key in the river, and took a boat cruise that ended with a spectacular light show!'
p3285
aS'Some of the highlights of the wedding was the bouquet Lisa made herself from flowers she bought from a roadside vendor, the photo shoot that took place all over the streets and squares of the city, and Lisa s diamond encrusted mini camera!\n'
