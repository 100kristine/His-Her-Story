        "  'metPars': ['From the beautiful Bride  Matthew and I met 12 years ago while in high school in Carlsbad, CA. Matthew finishing his junior year and myself a senior about to graduate and head to LA for college at Loyola Marymount University. Even though we meet at the end of high school we always call ourselves high school sweethearts because we can t remember what it was even like without one another. Both of us were born and raised in Carlsbad and attended the same junior high and high school. I was the first to admired Matthew from a distance before I finally asked a mutual friend about him; if he was single and a good guy. I think it was about a week later we had our first date and shortly thereafter we were two teenagers who were falling madly in love. One year later Matthew followed me to college at LMU. In the years that followed, throughout undergraduate school, we had some ups and downs but our life journey always brought us back to one another. Once we both graduated college we truly knew what we had and our relationship grew to an unbreakable bond. Living together in Westchester I quickly started working in Finance and Matthew was working as a Vet tech applying to Veterinary schools. After a few years he was accepted into Ross University a school in the West Indies. After many in depth conversations we decided to take the opportunity and make the big move. At first it was really hard to leave our life in Southern California; the familiarity we had built, my career and of course our family and friends but shortly after the move we realized everything was happening for a reason. We were on this once in a lifetime adventure together, meeting great friends and experiencing a different way of life. Being away and only having one another to lean on for everything our relationship grew to strongest it had ever been. We had a life together on an island in the Caribbean and it was amazing. We lived there with our two children (our dogs) and during our time there adopted two more. It was our first big adventure together and we loved what it did not only for us as individuals but together as a couple. After living in the Caribbean for a little over 2 years we finished his last year of school, his clinical year, at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. The South was a great experience but we were happy to head back to Los Angeles when the time came. As of recently we are back in beautiful Southern California. With a new and exciting outlook on life we hope to start putting down some roots soon and enjoy lifes special moments together as a family. We will forver be open to new adventures so who knows what the future may hold. Throughout all our years together and especially the last few away we have undoubtedly become stronger, wiser, more compassionate and even closer bestfriends. And above all, we truly love each other more everyday.',\n",
        "   'Matthew proposed in the fall of our second year on the island, a proposal that was totally a surprise. Something that is hard to do when you have been with someone for a decade and already very intertwined. He somehow pulled it off and caught me completely off guard and with the sweetest proposal. In true Matthew form it included animals a story about penguins and how they pick one mate for life. I was blown away not only that the whole thing was happening but by how nervous he was, it was simply so sweet. It made me giggle because after a decade I don t know how he ever thought for one second I would hesitate that yes he was so anxious to hear. It was such special day. I now had a fiance and a new journey to look forward to together all while enjoying the beautiful scenery we called home, the Carribean. After about a month of being engaged I knew it was time to start thinking about planning. The initial planning part was a little overwhelming at first, I didn t know where to begin. Mainly because I was trying to start it all from the Caribbean which meant I had to make quick trips back to California that were always a whirlwind with so much to do and see. All of which I know wouldn t have been possible without the help of our amazing families and the best girlfriends a girl could ever ask for. I remember seeing Bacara online before I saw it in person and we both fell in love. We loved that it was in Santa Barbara, a place we think of as beautiful and romantic which is a perfect backdrop for a wedding. It was luxurious and esquisite but still had that cool California coastal feel. We knew we wanted the vibe of the day to have touchs of old hollywood glam but with modern elements so as soon as I visited Bacara in person I knew it was the perfect place. Plus we knew at Bacara guests would feel like they were getting away for the weekend rather than just attending a wedding for a few hours. Once we set our fall date I knew that was the easiest part and what was to come would be hard because now we had so many details to decide on. That overwhelming feeling all changed when fate brought me to my first phone call with Allyson Joseph of Bob Gail Special Events. Hiring Ally as our wedding planner was the easiest decision I ever made, we had an instant connection. From the beginning Ally understood our vision and that showed throughout the whole process. She remembered and applied detail that is above and beyond. A five star service I know is one of a kind. We are so thankful for Ally, Lexi, Katie and the whole team. Not only did they do a great job but they work with and recommed the best of the best so our vendors were impecable. I truly don t know what I would have done without her expertise, she just got me and was always there to talk me through every detail. Being long distance from one another that was something I really valued and appreciated. As a result of our wedding not only did we meet an event planner for life but most importantly a friend for life  she truly is like family along with the rest of the Bob Gail team. Having our family and closest friends all together to celebrate our much anticipated day and with so much to be grateful for, it was simply perfection.',\n",
        "   'Our big day was beyond what I could have ever imagined. It was really important to us to provide our guests with an environment that made for an effortless evening, a sense of being taken care of. We wanted them to enjoy and party all night long without any care. Something Ally made sure went off without a hitch thorughout the whole day. When it finally came time to walk down the aisle as soon as I locked eyes with Matthew I knew all the extra stuff was just an added bonus. He truly is my heart and soul. After the ceremony we had a short but very special few minutes alone just us and the sunset where we had a chance to take everything in and just enjoy the moment together. Once we made our way up to the reception area I remember walking in for a sneak peek and even though I knew how everything was going to be set up there was nothing that could prepare me for how special it all felt when I stood in front of all our visions and dreams in real time, it was overwhelming in the best kind of way. From absolutely beautiful weather and scenery all weekend long, to the presence of our closest family and friends, to the exquisite detail, to the gorgous flowers, to the abubndance of food & drinks, and to the most amazing band, we couldn t have asked for a more perfect day. We are so grateful we have beautiful photos from Michael and Anna Costa to look at for years to come and of course a video we can t to watch from Vidicam Productions. Looking back on the day Matthew and I feel so lucky to have shared it all together. It was truly everything we dreamed of and so much more. A special thank you to everyone who was there to celebrate the start of our happily ever after with us.\\n'],\n",

Tim & Lindsey met in medical school at Mayo and are starting careers at a prestigious institution out east so yes, they have really good resumes, but at their wedding Tim & Lindsey s big, happy hearts were what anyone noticed and everyone cared about most. All day they exuded a joyfulness that touched everyone around them, that threatened constantly to well up and over into tears, that made everyone present grateful to be a part of such a day. But Lindsey & Tim didn t just absorb well-wishes   they continuously gave them back (as I suspect is the norm in their everyday lives) and delighted guests with, delicious foods, sights to be seen, games to be played, dances to be danced and even a meteor shower to be enjoyed. And they said Thank You in a most memorable way. After the toasts and dinners had been enjoyed Lindsey and Tim stood proudly in front of all their guests and told everyone about how lucky and blessed they are to have amazing families, parents and friends. Their parents, they said in particular, had formed them, modeling healthy marriages and lives well lived such that Lindsey and Tim have no doubt that they too will have a happy marriage. And as her dad teared up, Lindsey confirmed what everyone instinctively feels about the two of them   they are ready and excited to make each other the ultimate priority and build lives worth celebrating together. She simply said  mom, dad: we got this. '],\n",

Hands down, one of the most creative, inspiring, professional, and thoughtful people I have ever met. She really took the time to get to know us as a couple, and just took the extra time to ensure all the details were perfect. Considering we are so passionate about our careers, Lynsay gave us the idea to give our wedding a bit of a medical twist. Luckily, my maid of honor is a graphic designer and was able to whip up some amazing sign-in cards with each of them saying please write a  Prescription for a Happy Marriage  for the bride and groom. Also, for party favors we bought mini-brown glass bottles (to resemble a pill bottle), stuffed them with jelly beans, and had stickers made that said  There is no remedy to love but to love more.  All the guest loved them and were able to bring them home for treats the next day!'],\n",

Luckily, we had an amazing team to support us and ensure every detail was attended to so that we could focus on spending time with our family and friends. Our coordinator, Joy, of Joy Proctor Design, was a dream to work with and quite possibly the sweetest person we ve ever met! From day one, she gave us amazing advice on the planning process and was an invaluable partner. On top of that, she has an amazing eye for design; we knew we could trust her to bring our wedding vision to life! Our photographer, KT Merry, and her assistant, Chad, made the perfect team and captured the precious moments of our big day beautifully. KT and Chad were by our side the entire day and made us feel extremely comfortable in front of the camera. They were super sweet, patient and consummate professionals who executed with expert precision. We also absolutely adored our videographers, Aria Studios. They were so nice and fun to hang out with, like being with old friends. They re based in Hawaii and braved not one, but two(!) hurricane warnings just to make it to our wedding! Watching their incredible Same Day Edit video at our reception was the perfect way to end the best day of our lives.',\n",

We incorporated artifacts from our relationship into the displays and we took advantage of each element to tell a story about us. Instead of a standard dinner, we designed a unique brunch since that s our favorite meal. Instead of a full bar, we had a bubble bar and then added the Handsome Roasters coffee cart, because coffee (and Handsome, in particular) has been a huge part of our relationship. The table themes were inspired by our adventures together. Our refrigerator at home is covered in photo strips from every booth we ve ever encountered, so we rented a photo booth.

Josh had purchased a new camera that he had been filming me do almost everything on, including eating and walking, so when he decided to leave the camera rolling overnight to  catch the sunrise  I didn t question his motives. The next morning on our 3 year anniversary he woke me at 6:30 by opening the wall of curtains revealing the brightest ocean view. I immediately rolled over trying to go back to sleep. He finally was able to coax me to come to the edge of the bed, just barely awake he begins to serenade me with his ukulele (not unusual by the way). I start noticing though this time his voice is shaking, he actually seemed nervous which is not the norm. After finishing up 1,2,3,4 by Plain White Tees and a couple restarts of the song, he gets down on one knee and asks the question I had been waiting to hear almost 2 1/2 years ago! To make it even more perfect he surprised me with a serenade at our wedding! Which I was completely blown away by! He sings in front of me all the time, but never in front of an audience   an audience turns him a bit shy and bashful. But not on the day of our wedding! He was so confident and charming. He chose the song Stuck on You by Lionel Richie, which was a perfect song given I did feel like I had waited so long to become his Mrs.. It was perfect, right out of a movie.'],\n",

Instead, Stephanie and I met over coffee and I explained to her how much I loved flowers, my way too many ideas from Pinterest, and a budget to stay within. As we talked, she helped me finally pinpoint my style and color scheme (any bride will contest how much harder of a decision this is than it truly seems) and gave me so many ideas of her own. It was cool because I felt an instant connection with Steph. I realized instantly that she was so similar to me; we shared the same style, personality and passion for flowers. I told her leaving Starbucks that day that I trusted her 100% and that she could run with my color scheme and surprise me. It was a weight off of my shoulders to allow her to be creative and it felt great to cross something off the never-ending wedding to do list. The moment she knocked on my room at The Drake Hotel was one of my favorite wedding day memories. I didn t know what my flowers were going to look like until the day they were in my arms and I had been waiting months to see what she had picked out for me. I had tears of happiness in my eyes when I saw the vibrant colors and unique styles. Not only did she create perfect bouquets but she also transformed my venue into a floral masterpiece. I could not have even envisioned more perfect flowers than what Stephanie picked and designed for our big day.',\n",

It was such a relief when my husband and I met Jake at a coffee shop because I knew within the first five minutes that he would be our perfect wedding photographer. Nick and I had a blast with Jake as he shot our engagement pictures. We felt so comfortable with him and were laughing the entire time. We were amazed at his artistic eye and how well he was able to truly capture our love. On our wedding day, Jake was there early to shoot pictures of the landscape of our hotel and the amazing architecture of Chicago. Our entire bridal party raved about how much fun and how professional Jake was on the trolley with us, as he was able to capture our trip from the city to Evanston. Our families and our wedding guests had nothing but amazing things to say about him as well. When we received our wedding slideshow, I couldn t help but cry with happiness. I felt like I was reliving the day all over again. I was so overjoyed at how well Jake was able to capture every emotion on our wedding day.

They are classic yet whimsical, and I feel complement the vibrancy of our day s design. I did my hair and makeup myself. I have had my hair and makeup done at weddings by others in the past   I have learned what looks good and where and when to stop or add. Because it was so hot out I had to have my hair up.

Tiers of vanilla cake, Bavarian cream and fresh berries and decadent chocolate cake filled with layers of chocolate hazelnut were complemented with fresh flowers, pearl accents and the couple s monogram.

And not to be outdone, Greg s brothers and co-best men thoroughly entertained and simultaneously humiliated their middle brother by reading entries from a journal Greg kept as a child, while in the end, concluding their speeches with heartfelt words exhibiting the deep bond and connection the three brothers shared. The remainder of the evening was all about dancing and celebrating. Even with many guests having to board planes in a few hours to return to the east coast, the incredible 16-piece band from Wayne Foster Entertainment kept the dance-floor packed and by the designated end time, guests were repeatedly chanting  ONE MORE SONG,  refusing to call it a night!'],\n",

Knowing that I (Eric) couldn t let her slip from my grasp another time, I started to make plans to propose. A ring was purchased and airline transportation was planned. After lunch with her parents, where I again asked for permission to marry their daughter (this time in person), I surprised her at work and told her we had dinner reservations wherever she wanted to go. 24 reservations had been made and I m sure that the other 23 still aren t too happy with me. After we got back to her apartment, but before dinner, I told her that I couldn t imagine my life without her and asked her to marry me.

Their emotions were real and everyone in the church could feel it. The entire day was filled with emotion and Jessica from JED Photography captured that in the best way.

Since businesses were shut down and our offices were closed my girlfriends and I went to a well-known Dallas restaurant (Mi Cocina) for lunch and a few Mambo Taxi s (Margarita s). Quintan also happened to be there with a group of his friends and in the empty restaurant the waiter decided to sit our two tables right next to each other. After a few margaritas Quintan and his friends decided to break the ice with a few jokes and by the end of the night our tables were pushed together and everyone was getting to know each other. Quintan introduced himself to me early on and we had an immediate connection and spent the rest of the day getting to know each other and drinking a few too many margaritas.

And to top it all off, it all unfolded against a beautiful urban landscape. I had dreamed about photographing their wedding since the first day I met Rachel and was beaming with excitement all day long. To keep with the urban aspect of the theme I suggested the West Loop as the backdrop for the first look and formal portraits. The guys even made a stop at Au Cheval on Randolph to sip on a gorgeous 12 year old scotch before hamming it up for the camera. The ladies stepped out onto the West Loop streets in their coordinating muted pastel cocktail dresses and Rachel was an absolute dream in her Bettina gown by J.Crew. Her bouquet featured succulents and her grandmother s broach.\\n\\nRachel + Adrian s first look was one of the more touching I have ever documented and the red doors in the background added an awesome pop of color! The reception and ceremony was held at Fulton s on the River and I cannot say enough about the wonderful staff, especially the event planner Darcey; they made us all feel so welcomed!!\\n\\nDuring the ceremony a memorial chair sat vacant in the front row, lit by a single candle, commemorating the memory of Rachel s mother. Rachel and Adrian also performed a water ceremony to combine together the two great lakes they had each grew up next to. The ceremony and reception decor was nothing short of perfection and Rachel s Etsy finds, including the vintage key escort cards, accentuated the Parisian theme. The tables were adored with french macaroons, devine florals by Flowerlife, candles and feather plumes; it all paired nicely with the sleek interior at Fulton s on the River.\\n\\nAs the skyline turned from day to night the urban lights flooding the river and surrounding streets mirrored the flicking candles inside; guests danced to the awesome beats expertly composed by Matt Kuhnen of Style Matters while others smoked cigars and sipped bourbon on the patio along the river. From the LaSalle bridge sounds of laughter could be heard as this beautiful couple began their next stage in life  together.'],\n",

Joy defines the entire relationship of discovering our mutual passions, interests, and love of being together.

A combination of roses, lisianthus, dahlias and hydrangeas combined with Proteas (South Africa s national flower), fynbos, Queens lace and ferns emphasised the English country garden feel. ',\n",
        "   'When it came to my dress I d never known exactly what type I wanted   in fact I could tell you all the things I didn t want but not what I liked. Being only 5 2  I knew that I couldn t pull off a frothy gown and with the South African summer I wanted something light and travel friendly. I tried on several different style dresses but kept coming back to this beautiful tulle Jenny Packham dress with fluted sleeves and lots of tiny sequins and paillettes with the smallest of trains. I didn t have any sort of emotional connection to the dress but just kept being drawn back to it   it was so comfortable and flattering and could see myself spending the whole day in it. I borrowed a pair of diamond earrings from my mom and wore a simple pendant necklace that Nick gave me the day before.'],\n",

The morning of consisted with a morning swim, followed by breakfast in bed that was provided by the resort. Denis & I found it surreal that our wedding day finally arrived. After breakfast he went to his room to meet his grooms men to get ready for the day. My girls and I met in my honeymoon suite and got ready. It was a sunny and super hot day   the only day without any rain. We got ready, took pictures and by the time you knew it, it was time for the ceremony. Jenny & the Dreams La Romana team did a great job getting everything ready. We had a pier ceremony & a beach reception with LED lit dance floor   highly recommend this to any bride having a breach reception! At the end of reception, we had brought sky lanterns with us for each guest to make a wish and let into the sky. This is was coolest idea as everyone loved it and it was really pretty as the sky lanterns filled up the sky with pretty lights.'],\n",

        "  'metPars': ['From Little White Dress Bridal Shop Carl and Megan met while serving as Peace Corps education volunteers. Their paths crossed at a Peace Corps conference just outside of Namibia s capitol city, Windhoek. However, the schools they taught at were 200km from each other. This meant for the first 8 months of their relationship, seeing each other meant hitchhiking on the desolate Namibian roads from one town to the next. In 2008 Megan s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and although she was only fifteen months into her Peace Corps service, Megan decided that returning to Salt Lake City was the right thing to do. Carl finished his twenty-four months of service and opted to join Megan in Salt Lake instead of returning to his hometown of Great Falls, Montana. Carl and Megan both started graduate school as they supported Megan s mom through cancer treatment. Fortunately, the cancer treatment was successful.',\n",
        "   'Megan and Carl had decided that they would return to country they first met, Namibia, to get married. They knew that marrying in Namibia would pose interesting logistical challenges, but the two agreed it had to be done. Not only were Megan and Carl dying to return to the county they loved, where they fell in love, but Megan s family had planned to visit during her Peace Corps service, but couldn t due to her mother s illness. In the summer of 2011, Megan contacted the Sossusvlei Lodge in the southwestern part of Namibia, located on the border of the Namib-Naukluft National Park, in the Namib Desert. The Namib-Naukluft National Park boasts some of the world s largest sand dunes that are colored an intense burnt-orange, contrasting markedly to the deep blue African sky. The largest dunes are located around an area of the park called Sossusvlei, which is where the Sossusvlei Lodge takes its name. Such a tourist destination would perhaps help entice friends and relatives to join in on the journey. Christelle du Toit, hotel manager and event coordinator of the Sossusvlei Lodge, responded to Megan s initial requests, and they exchanged a few emails coordinating logistics, and in one email, Christelle wrote:  It will be our pleasure to make your request come true.  It felt like a fairy godmother granting a wish, but the requestors had not given much detail. Megan and Carl wanted the wedding to be simple, personal and elegant, but neither had given much thought to wedding details. They two just wanted to travel! Christelle mentioned the menu was pre-set due to the logistics of being literally in the middle of nowhere, flowers would be difficult due to the location and heat, there was no electricity at the ceremony site, they could not accommodate more than seventy people because they only had seventy chairs and they had never put together a rehearsal dinner before.  Fine, fine, fine,  Megan and Carl said. The location and being together were all that mattered. In August of 2011, the bride and groom s parents hosted an engagement party and announced that in two years time, on August 26th, 2013, Megan and Carl would wed at the Sossusvlei Lodge in Namibia and anyone interested in an African adventure should consider joining.',\n",
        "   'Carl and his groomsmen, including his best man and the officiant, Ghidewon Arefe, made due by ironing shirts on footstools. Megan s flower girls came to get ready with the bridal party. Christelle told everyone except the bridal party to be ready to leave at 4:15 PM sharp to be shuttled via sand buggy to the wedding site (wherever that was). The bridal party was shuttled out at 4:30 in a sand buggy Christelle and her team tied with a simple ribbon and wreathe. Christelle also personally made a bouquet for Megan of grasses from around the lodge so she would have something to hold as she walked down the aisle. The driver set off straight into the desert, and nothing but grass, sand, mountains and a few sparse trees were in view. Finally the group arrived at a nook at the base of a rocky outcrop with a giant camelthorn tree set between two huge boulders. Christelle hung wooden hearts on the tree that swirled in the desert breeze and lined the aisle with native grasses. Carl and Megan chose a rendition of  Fools Rush In  performed by Megan s aunts for the processional. A lot of time and effort went into the ceremony program, which Megan and Carl were so excited to share with their guests. The first reading was Goodridge vs. the Department of Public Health, the 2003 ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Court that legalized gay marriage, which is an issue close to the hearts of the couple. The bride and groom s parent s helped honor relatives that couldn t be there, those that had passed and also offered advice for the couple entering into their marriage. Next, Megan s brother, Zach, debuted a song he wrote called  Your Someone  on his Key-tar, which he d lugged from Salt Lake along with a battery powered amplifier, since there was no electricity at the site. The  Dude of Honor  read a passage from one of the couple s favorite books, Travels with Charlie. Carl s dad performed the Hungarian tradition of placing a gold and silver coin in the shoe of the bride to symbolize never having to go without, which honored Carl s Hungarian grandmother and the couple concluded the ceremony with the breaking of a wineglass to honor Megan s Jewish heritage.'],\n",

After the wedding, Megan took Carl around her old stomping ground in Sydney, where she studied in 2003. On the final day of the trip, Megan and Carl visited Taronga Zoo, which Megan bragged to Carl had the best views of Sydney Harbor. While at the zoo, the two came upon a deserted amphitheater used for bird shows that just happened to have a spectacular view of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Then Megan realized Carl was kneeling down next to her. Carl proposed and pulled off nearly the impossible: he managed to surprise Megan. She had been so busy preparing to be in her friend s wedding and planning for the trip that an engagement of her own was the last thing on her mind. The next day, they flew home elated and to a very excited family who, of course, had been in on the whole scheme.']},\n",

        "  'metPars': ['From Michael and Anna Costa Photography Dan and Lauren met in December of 2008 in Kathmandu, Nepal, where they joined the same tour group to hike to Mt. Everest Base Camp.  Dan is originally from Birmingham, England, and Lauren is originally from Bakersfield, California (but was living in Los Angeles at the time), so it seemed like fate that they both happened to travel alone to the same distant city on the same dates with the same goal. These exotic circumstances meant that Dan & Lauren s first date was kind of a group date (there were 8 other travelers on the hike, plus guides and sherpas, who were with them at all times), and it lasted for almost 12 straight days.  Instead of the traditional flowers, the first gifts that Dan gave Lauren were a piece of string to tie her solar battery charger onto the back of her backpack, and an extra roll of toilet paper, since she had been suffering from food poisoning the first week of the hike and had run low on her own supply!  Since they had no privacy amongst the group on the hike (and no showers for 9 days of the trip), all they could do was walk, talk, laugh and learn a whole lot about one another.  Although Dan didn t work up the courage to make a romantic move until almost the end of their journey, they shared their first kiss in Lukla (high up in the Himalayas), and after the pair parted ways in Kathmandu on New Years  Eve, Dan was smitten enough that he booked a trip to California and came to visit Lauren in L.A. the week after she returned home. He met her parents on that trip, then she went straight back to England 2 weeks later to meet his family, and they realized things were serious.'],\n",

Crew sweater that Bronzon wore on an auspicious day in May 2010 because it caught my eye from a mile away. We met during the summer before our last year of college and started dating almost immediately. As those days of languor ended, we parted ways to finish college   Bronzon at UC Berkeley and I at University of Southern California. Even during the first months of long-distance dating, our lives moved in serendipitous lock step, which made it so much easier for us (and our love) to grow and mature together. Long story short, we both found jobs in the Bay Area (that even started on the same day). Then, the very same thing happened with our next jobs! After some time of both living and working in the heart of downtown San Francisco, in October 2013, we got engaged during a horseback ride on a sunny day in the thick of the Marin woodlands.',\n",
        "   'A May 3, 2014 wedding date put us on a 6-month timeline, so the planning process quickly commenced. I discovered that the modern bride s challenge is comprised largely of the limitless options she has to choose from. One choice that was easy to make for both of us, from the beginning, was the venue   Bronzon s parents  home. The Tudor style house in Bronzon s hometown of Chico, California, is nestled among lush greenery (meticulously groomed for the wedding by my father in law, who also strung lights, set up fountains, and handcrafted a tree swing, a wood block for our cake, and welcome banners for us), oak and willow trees, and best of all, a little lake with a dock   the perfect place to exchange our vows. Bronzon is the third of four siblings, the first two of whom had already been married at the house, but in different locations around the property; so, we were excited to follow this privilege of a family tradition.',\n",
        "   'Many of us would agree that mothers have a lifelong passion for nourishing us. Our mothers were no exception. When I mentioned to my mom that Bronzon and I wanted to serve a signature drink that reflected our combined tastes   a strawberry mojito mocktail   she promptly set up something like a chemistry lab in her kitchen and laboriously perfected the recipe with the help of my taste-testing dad in between the many weekly hour-and-a-half-long drives my dad and mom made to San Francisco for my dress fittings. My mother-in-law and legend of a baker, catered to every one of our dessert requests, which included not just homemade red velvet cake (complete with edible gold leaf detail) but also berry tarts, pecan tarts, and Bronzon s childhood favorite   strawberry rollup. For our guest favors, she made miniature strawberry jams.'],\n",

        "  'metPars': ['From the Bride  Looking back, I m a little embarrassed that I didn t dress up more. It was my close friend s Super Bowl party, so what was the need? Little did I know my life would change forever after that Sunday. When I arrived I was greeted by many familiar faces. I settled in to watch the game, but mostly chat with my girlfriends. I noticed the unfamiliar face walk in immediately. I was introduced to Tom by an old friend telling me Tom was his newly single roommate. He smiled and casually introduced himself to the group. He was cute, really cute. But as quickly as he said hello, he quietly slipped out of the circle.  Well, so much for talking to the cute guy,  I thought. For the rest of the game, our only interactions were when we shimmied past each other in the hallway or chatting with the group. However, at some point, and sadly I can t remember exactly how, what was a group of five or six telling stories about their weekend, Tom and I were left alone talking and laughing. I was shocked. I wasn t shocked that we were speaking directly to each other; I was shocked at how comfortable I was talking to him. I went from hanging out with five of my lifelong friends to speaking to someone I d only know a few minutes and yet somehow I felt like I had known him my whole life. We did the predictable background Q&A and quickly discovered that we grew up less than 15 minutes from each other, had countless friends in common and shared numerous interests. Sadly, as great as the conversation was going, my ride was leaving so I said it was nice to meet him and gave him a moment to ask for my number. He promptly filled the moment with,  It was nice to meet you too. Hope you get home safe.  With that, Tom walked away. Needless to say I was disappointed and immediately blamed my casual Super Bowl attire. Like any party, leaving isn t fast. My thoughts of disappointment were erased with an,  Umm, hey,  from behind. I turned to see Tom standing there. In a cute, but nervous voice he said  Umm, so do you want to hang out sometime?  I played it cool,  Sure . Tom let out a great big smile but in a sarcastic tone, which I would grow to love, replied with,  Well, how about I give you my number, that way when you change your mind you don t have to deal a weird stalker? ',\n",
        "   ' Over the next week Tom and I exchanged text messages and set up a time for our first date the following Monday. We met at a bar in West Los Angeles at 6pm for a few drinks, because we both had work the next day. Before I knew it, my stomach was sore from laughing and the bar was closing. Our first date flew by in an instant much like the next four years of our lives. We spent holidays together, took vacations together, and eventually moved to San Francisco together. As is true for most adults in their late 20s, life is hectic. Our one spot to slow down was Tom s family s ranch in Paso Robles, Spring Ranch. Tom grew up spending weekends and summers on the ranch and showed me his deep love of it. Growing up a country fan, this was a match made in heaven and I quickly shared his deep seeded love for the ranch. It was on the ranch where Tom proposed to me, and on the ranch where we held our wedding reception.',\n",
        "   ' With over a year to plan, Tom and I wanted to be meticulous with every step we took. It was a no-brainer choosing Spring Ranch as our venue for the reception, as it was such a special place for us and Tom s family had hosted numerous weddings and events there. However, beyond that we were unsure. After doing extensive research and meeting with multiple wedding coordinators we were ecstatic when Percy Sales agreed to be our coordinator. The foundation of his vision was the same as ours, yet he brought so much experience and creativity that he was able to create something far more incredible than we could have dreamt. Everything Percy organized met our wish of an elegant country wedding. From the food, flowers and music to the table settings, lighting and countless other details; it was an absolute dream.',\n",

Jenn only started catching on when he started describing who he hoped she would be in the future and just as she began to suspect something was happening, Michael was on one knee, asking her to marry him!

We had hoped for at least part of the wedding to be outdoors and ended up choosing to do the ceremony at Crossline Community Church, and the reception outdoors at Shady Canyon Golf Club. We had toyed with the idea of using tents but ultimately, decided on string lighting. Jenn s friend showed her a picture of some lanterns, and given that we both loved the idea and the look, that was immediately incorporated into our plans.',\n",

We researched long and hard and met several Chicago-area photographers before finally deciding on Hannah. Before meeting her, we already loved her style and the exceptional results she had produced at previous weddings from viewing her impressive website. However, within minutes of being in her company, Meghan and I both knew Hannah was the perfect fit, especially given the amazing energy and enthusiasm she brings to her undoubted talent.',\n",
        "   'From Hannah Persson  So many little pieces added to this beautiful wedding. Shane, the groom, is from Ireland, where Meghan, the bride, actually first met him! They fell in love, and Shane moved back here to the States. When guests travel far from other countries, it always seems like the celebration is that much more beautiful. The groom s dad actually worked on the awesome yellow VW for about a week straight before the wedding just so that Shane and Meghan would be able to make their getaway in it. It had extra special significance because the car belonged to the bride s father, who passed away several years ago. One of Meghan s friend designed the gorgeous invitations. The guest s table cards showed off the couples  love for travel, as did the table numbers, as each had a different post card from a different travel destination for the couple. The couple used to live in Washington state, so the wood underneath the flowers on the tables was from Washington. The bride scoured thrift stores to find all the beautiful and unique vases to hold the flowers   super creative! The groom loves photography, so there were lots of old cameras decorating the reception space. The beautiful old Victorian elegance paired perfectly with the eclectic set up of the reception space. The couple loves music, so they had a banjo and violin player during cocktail hour, then the amazing Lisa Rene Band, followed by a special song played by a guest on the accordian. Of course, the late night snack was fish and chips- also super cute! The photoshoot took place at Fabyan Gardens in St. Charles, which is beyond gorgeous with the arches and gates. So much prettiness and love packed into one day.'],\n",

The couple decided to get dressed and attempt a park wedding anyhow! We said we were moving through to cross the park, but once inside the rangers sort of looked the other way while we spent hours alone in the vast and immense beauty of Yosemite (including being the only people at The Ahwahnee!)!

The design on the envelope liner was a map with a thread and a heart linking Switzerland and Florida. Our tables were designated with names of towns of places we d been together and photos we d taken. Because almost of all our guests were traveling to Florida (Naples is not the original home of either of us), from all parts of the US, Canada, Switzerland, and even Australia, we really wanted to show our gratitude to them for sharing in our day. We made guest bags (with the help of dear local friends!) filled with homemade granola, muffins, Swiss chocolates (for Yves), oranges (for Florida) and Naples  magazines. We also love this quote from C.S. Lewis about a  secret thread  which unites certain people. We made sure that from the design of the invitation, to the program, to the guest book (a dictionary!), to the favors, there was a  secret thread  throughout.'],\n",

That method took the pressure off doing what was  in  or what our other engaged friends were doing. In the end, the evening felt cohesive and we regretted none of our decisions.

Our close friend officiated the ceremony and incorporated personal anecdotes into his marriage address. That, while being surrounded by family and friends, lead to a powerful and moving experience and absolutely the best part of the day. As we were announced husband and wife, our guests blew New Year s Eve paper horns as a celebratory tribute to how we met. The Ravenswood Event Center s Industrial Ballroom had the perfect space for a  strolling cocktail party.  The center used passed dishes, food stations and carted treats to keep the flow moving. Andy and Jen at REC dreamed up a menu that reflected our tastes (which is anything but fancy) but added a creative spin (think grilled leek and shrimp quesadillas, and honey and prosciutto white sauce flatbread). Even though it was a cocktail party, our guests left stuffed and couldn t stop talking about the food. I wanted to be very hands-on with the wedding crafts but for projects beyond my capabilities I enlisted the help of some very talented and creative family and friends. ',\n",

Aaron s dad has long personal ties to Superdawg and made sure the famous Chicago dogs were served as a late night snack. At the end of the night, our guests were treated to an assortment of our favorite sweets which they could enjoy on their way home. The day was unforgettable and emotionally overwhelming in the best way possible. We couldn t be more grateful for the love of our family and friends, and the talent and care of our vendors. '],\n",

The style of our day was whimsical, sophisticated, and a little sassy.',\n",
        "   'We currently live in Toronto, Canada, but we re originally from the Midwest. We always thought it would be nice to have our celebration in Rocheport (population 243) because it s such a charming town full of Bed & Breakfasts, with galleries, antique shops, and even a blacksmith. Many guests stayed within three blocks of each other. The mayor baked our pizzas at the general store for the rehearsal dinner, and together we walked down the cobblestone streets before walking down the aisle. We chose to have the wedding a couple miles up the road at Les Bourgeois Winery. The bluff top overlooking the Missouri River was an ideal ceremony location, showcasing how truly beautiful Missouri can be. The rustic terrace inside the winery served as the setting for our quaint reception while Ironweed, a local bluegrass band, provided the tunes on the bluff for the ceremony and cocktail hour. In designing the invitations, I was inspired by the venue, and I really wanted to emphasize its location on the river. We served pies from our favorite shop in our hometown, which was special since we spent many date nights chatting over a slice of chocolate cheesecake.',\n",

It was there that I met another artist and now dear friend, Lili Johnstone of D fy. She made every single paper flower for our wedding by hand. She spent months and hundreds of hours making these one of a kind masterpieces into bouquets, centerpieces, and everything in between. I am so thankful for her hard work, and I admire her persistence on this project! As you can imagine, planning a wedding from another country had its challenges, but knowing Lili was in charge was such a huge stress reliever.',\n",

They sell gently used, donated gowns, and all of their profits go to various cancer charities. I loved this idea! I ended up finding a discontinued style that I had pinned, and it was truly meant to be. I was alone at the shop (which is a house filled with dresses), so I frantically texted my mom and best friend for reassurance before the purchase. The sweet high-low gown perfectly framed my mint heels. I topped it off with a sparkly blush shrug from BHLDN and a custom fascinator from Lilliput Hats in Toronto. The beautiful bridesmaids chose their own dresses, and despite the fact that we had never all been in one location until the day before the wedding, everything coordinated perfectly.'],\n",

We live in New York, so planning a wedding cross country was a daunting task, but with Nira s help and my mom and best friends we were able to put together a truly special day. Rob and I fell in love with the Smog Shoppe because it was an awesome combination of industrial elements mixed with the beautiful succulent garden and a Vintage flair- it felt like us! The whole theme of the wedding was combining things that on paper aren t supposed to go together like burlap and lace and succulents and roses. My mother started collecting old tins and tea pots and our incredible florist Gilly filled them with yellow flowers and succulents that were in season. Our ceremony was very special and non traditional, our officiants were my brother and Rob s step mother and we wrote the whole thing ourselves, including many different traditions as possible. We stood under a chuppah made by one of my bridesmaids out of old and handkerchiefs and remembrances given to us from our families. We wanted our guests to feel like they were at our home for a back yard bbq so the food had to be great! Heirloom more than delivered, we had burgers and tacos and farmers market fresh salads. Neither Rob or I have ever liked cake but we love pie, so we got a variety of incredible pies from Porch Pies and decorated them with fun novelty cake toppers. The band was very important to Rob since he is a musician himself (we met at one of his gigs) and Nira suggested Dustbowl Revival- an great bluegrass/rock and roll band based in LA- they were so good that a few of our guests went to see them play the following night! We tried to incorporate as many fun details as possible, vintage fans to use during the ceremony in case it was hot and yellow and green pashminas for when the sun went down.

But when they found a very deserving couple (a must read, see below) to act as models, they turned the whole shindig around and threw this lovely bride a surprise vow renewal.

Jamie and I went on the hunt. We didn t have to search too far to meet John and Tracey Weatherwax. John and Tracey have such a beautiful and inspiring love story. They just celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary (can you believe it they look so young) and NEVER had a wedding. Their story goes a bit like this: John and Tracey met right after they graduated from high school. John was headed off to the Army and Tracey was off to college but they fell in love quickly. The spent a lot of time writing letters back and forth and it was in one of those letters that John first told Tracey he wanted to marry her. After several months, John got his assignment with the Army and it was taking him to Germany. He of course did not want to leave Tracey behind so he put on his best suit and some cologne, got down on one knee and asked her to marry him on a payphone! She said yes. They were married in a civil service with only her dad and sister as witnesses. They always said that one day they would have a wedding. Well many things happened over the next 20 years that kept pushing that dream off. They spent a few years in Germany, and then headed back to the US all while Tracey was trying to finish college. Finally they decided to begin their family and unfortunately discovered that they were unable to have children. Of course this was heartbreaking for both of them but they always believed that there was a bigger plan for them. John and Tracey decided that they would adopt and became an instant family of five when they adopted their three sons all at once! You can imagine that with three busy boys, that dream of a wedding was put on the back burner for a really long time.',\n",

This was the focal point of our ceremony, and it looked absolutely magical in front of the rich green ivy-covered brick edifice.

We held the ceremony in the front yard and the reception in the back. We were initially a little worried that the lawn area in the front was not large enough, but the setting ended up being astonishingly beautiful. Our wedding planner, Nancy, suggested having a circular ceremony that would feel intimate and also maximize our space. My most magical memory of the day was stepping out of the house into a circle of guests waiting in the front yard.

Boy  amazing decision, it is a video you can relive over and over and to have moving pictures of the most amazing day, that for many couples is over in the blink of an eye, a video helps that day last forever.\\n 3) Make choices that satisfy you and your partner. In the end, this is your day, yes of course be kind and courteous to others opinions, but choose a photographer that shares your artistic style as you ll look at those picture for decades, choose the dress you feel stunning in, choose the people you want standing by your side, be true to the two of you and take the time to enjoy this amazing time in your lives.\\n 4) Oh  consider doing a boudoir shot with onelove photography and presenting it to your groom as your gift, it is a fun day for you filled with pampering and feeling sexy and it is certainly something that your partner will enjoy for years to come.'],\n",

From the day we got engaged, we were torn between eloping and having a stereotypically grandiose Indian ceremony, between having something local and accessible rather than something remote and intimate   these are, of course, decisions we never had to make in full, instead indulging ourselves with our favorite parts of each.  We settled on Kauai for our reception because, despite our constantly connected careers and lives, we wanted somewhere completely cut off from technology. Somewhere you don t really need GPS because there s only one road, and where you aren t worried about your bandwidth affecting Netflix streaming quality because you can hardly stay indoors. With endless beaches surrounding lush tropical forests, Kauai seemed like the most remote yet visually rich landscape within several thousand miles of home. It also incorporated my husband s love of the outdoors as well as the preternatural comfort I take in flora and natural beauty.',\n",

We were told to prepare for some interesting and unpredictable weather in Kauai, supposedly the wettest island, but nothing could have prepared us for snow and freezing rain in Dallas   it certainly made us feel loved that our guests braved that weather to celebrate with us.  Once we escaped the Texas frost to sunny Kauai, we were in the able hands of our wedding planner, Morgan Childs, of Moana Events. She really helped us articulate a vision that brought together our eclectic styles and taste into something truly one-of-a-kind. The residence at Na Aina Kai s botanical gardens proved to be the perfect backdrop for our welcome dinner, providing ample space for Bollywood dancing and East African barbecue.  Despite ample rain the entire week, the clouds parted at 3pm, giving way to the sun just minutes before our afternoon ceremony. The style and decor provided by Martin Roberts, in the elegant tent from Kauai tents, were beyond compare   capturing every aesthetic we had both imagined. The dancing and festivities were broken up by an incredible dinner from Contemporary Flavors as well as breathtaking Tahitian and Fire Knife dance performances from Urahutia Productions.  After the wedding, the things we remember fondest are the things that went against plan   the rain, the mud, the groom losing his ring (don t ask). We can scarcely remember the sublime, captivating moments and scenes that Fawne and Sebastian of Sea Light Studios captured so perfectly. Every detail from place settings to floral arrangements to beverage stations reflected our vision perfectly, and the time Morgan took to really understand us before executing really made a difference   the entire affair was perfectly reflective of us.  We re now left with a special attachment to Kauai unlike any other place, as this remote tropical paradise, for one weekend, became  ours    and thanks to the memories, it will forever remain that way.\\n'],\n",

We live in London and were engaged in Paris, and wanted to honor these experiences on our big day. I chose a 1950s long-sleeved lace gown and satin Fendi heels to pay homage to my Italian heritage and love of fashion and vintage silhouettes; Brian wore a petrol-blue, 3-piece Paul Smith Bespoke suit to honor traditional English tailoring, along with Paul Smith shoes, a Gucci tie and Falke socks (all in reference to his travels). I incorporated a brooch on my bouquet that belonged to my late grandmother, and carried my father s handkerchief   my something  borrowed  and  blue  as it was ink-stained   that also belonged to my late grandfather. Brian wore antique cufflinks that I bought him for our first Christmas together in 2009. Surrounded by our closest family and friends, we were married on the campus of Indiana University (my alma mater) and celebrated with a wonderful dinner provided by IMU Catering. We chose a palette of white, cream and blush to compliment the winter season, with accents of navy to pick up the tones in Brian s suit. Our first dance song was  Si tu vois ma m re  by Sidney Bechet, which is the theme song to the movie  Midnight in Paris , one of our favorite films. We worked with the Beck Chapel organist to tailor our music choices   while the welcome music was traditional Baroque, we had U2 s  All I Want Is You , Sigur Ros s  Untitled 3  and The Beatles   All You Need Is Love  set to the organ for the bridal party processional, the bride s processional, and the recessional, respectively. Our entrance song was a live jazz rendition of Steely Dan s  Peg . All of these little details came together to make for an incredible day, but for us, the best moment was seeing each other in the chapel as the music played   after this, time stopped and the rest is history!\\n'],\n",

The venue itself was so beautiful it didn t need too much dressing up but we knew we wanted beautiful flowers, and a gorgeous reception. We brought in gold chargers, gold chevari chairs and cutlery. James did all the custom signage for us, my mother made the linens for the Kings table (James wanted patterns and this is where we brought it in) and we had a stunning runner of flowers down the center. We also had a camera station seeing that I was a photographer and wanted something that reflects that. It was all pulled together and styled by Kae and Ales, wedding stylists from Portland OR who we brought in to do it for us.\\n'],\n",

Our wedding day was on July 23th, which was exactly 7 years after we first met each other and fell in love while on holiday in France. We planned a summer wedding hoping that the weather would be warm and sunny, and we got lucky because it was a beautiful summer day. We really wanted to get married outside, in nature, because we both are outdoorsy people and enjoy the beauty of what nature has to offer. We wanted the wedding to portray us as individuals and as a couple. Therefore we choose the theme bohemian/vintage adding a lot of small details referring to this; a globe, suitcases, field flowers, dream catchers, feathers, Persian carpets and wooden tables.',\n",
        "   'Having a smaller budget made planning the wedding a little bit more difficult sometimes but it also made inspired us to be creative and think of some very nice ideas. One of them was to ask all of our guests to make and bring a bite to eat. Some were asked to bring a main dish, others to make a dessert. We really liked this idea because we felt that it made all of the guests more involved in the wedding, but also because a very formal dinner just did not suit us at all. It turned out even better than we hoped! There were tables full of beautiful and delicious food, it really looked amazing! It was great to see that everyone put so much effort into making us a wonderful dinner.'],\n",

When planning our special day, it was essential for our wedding to capture the special memories we have created together throughout the years and include the people who have supported and fostered our relationship. It was important to both of us that our wedding was unique and memorable. We knew we wanted to find a venue where we could hold both the ceremony and reception. Dan and I really liked the idea of getting married outdoors with the sun beginning to set at the end of the ceremony. When Dan s brother Adam, the best man, raved about a wedding he had attended at the Dananda House, we had to check it out! We loved the tidy gardens, vast landscape, and the atrium with three walls of ceiling to floor windows that overlooked the forest preserve. We immediately knew that this was the ideal place for us to officially tie the knot!\\n\\nPart of the theme that we selected had that strong rustic feel, with elements of birch and trees in the invitations, floral arrangements and wedding d cor. My friends tease me that my home looks like a picture out of the Pottery Barn catalog, so I was immediately drawn to the rustic and vintage details of mercury glass and lanterns. The lanterns were used to line the aisle and reused on guests  tables during the reception. Mercury glass candles, globes, vases and votives offered delicate decoration to the cocktail, guest, feasting, dessert, and place card tables. Romantic details came in the rich fabrics of my dress, bouquet ribbon, flower selection, calligraphy, and candle lighting. Skeleton keys adorned place cards to capture a classic vintage feel for guests.\\n'],\n",

We met at summer camp, Hume Lake Christian camp, to be specific! I remember being out in the middle of the lake with some girls in my cabin when we met. I even remember the exact shirt he was wearing. Haha. After camp, we found each other on MySpace and begin building a friendship from that point on. He quickly became my best friend. I was so impressed by how easy he was to talk to, how much he made me laugh, and how absolutely different he was to me than any other guy I had met. Living 6 hours away at the time, we would stay up late nights skyping and talking on the phone. We could talk for hours and hours. It was hard to ever say goodbye or goodnight. After a couple years of building a solid friendship, we always knew we had feelings for each other but didn t know how the long distance would work. We decided in February of 2011 to give it a shot and  officially  date. We remained long distance for about 10 months, taking multiple trips back and forth to see each other. In January of 2012, Kyle moved up by me to join the local Fire Academy. He ended up living with my brother and his wife for about 6 months during academy, then got his own place. He stayed up here ever since! The rest is history. I married my best friend, my complete answer to prayer.',\n",

The view was breathtaking and brought back memories of the first date we spent together 3 years prior. To my knowledge, I thought we were just going on a walk like we had done the first time, little did I know he had much more planned. When we reached the peek, he got down on one knee and popped the question! The ring was stunning, I couldn t believe it was mine! I remember asking him   this is mine?!  His brother was hiding in the bushes capturing the whole moment! It gets even better  Our families live 6 hours apart, so I was a little bummed knowing I would have to wait a few days to see my mom and sisters. The first chance I got, I called my mom to share in the excitement! Kyle told me that we would be going to dinner with his parents but we needed to stop by his house first. When we arrived, I was surprised by so many of his friends and family all cheering for us when we walked in. I still tear up thinking about it. As I walk further in the house admiring the beautiful decorations that his mom and my sister-in-law, Whitney put together, I hear my dad s voice! I turn around and see my dad, mom and sister standing there. I immediately dropped to the ground. I was so overwhelmed with joy, something I have never in my life felt. Before we got engaged Kyle knew the only 2 things I really wanted was pictures of the moment and to share in the excitement afterward with family and friends. He definitely went above and beyond what I could of ever imagined!'],\n",

Due to various life events (mainly in part to the fact that we were both so young and at very different stages of our lives at that point in time), Justin and I went our separate ways and had little to no contact for 3 years. Then one day, I got a random text message from him. As he would say, he couldn t stop thinking about me and just decided to reach out to see if I would respond.

It truly is my favorite time of year, so when Justin popped the question on New Years Eve 2011, it made perfect sense. Going to plays is one of our things we love to do together, so weeks in advance he had planned a date night for us to go see Cinderella at a local theater and grab dinner at one of our favorite restaurants in the city. On the night of New Years Eve, 2011, we walked out of the play and it was snowing these huge, puffy, white gorgeous snowflakes, the sight was so beautiful it made me tear up   little did I know what was coming that would make me really cry. He asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the park that is across from the theater. The park had all the trees light up, dripping in gorgeous, sparkly white lights. We walked hand-in-hand, soaking up the beauty of the snow, loving that moment with each other . And then Justin got down on one knee and asked me to spend the rest of my life with him.

When she said June 28th was available that is when we set our date for our elopement! Our vision for our secret wedding was a romantic island elopement where elegance meets simplicity. I found my dress through the J Crew wedding collection. I had two pairs of shoes, a flowery sandal for walking on the beach and for my something blue, a fun pair of blue heels from Badgley Mishka. I had  borrowed  my moms pearl necklace and Louis gave me pearl earrings as a wedding gift. Kristy at The LAB Salon did a beautiful job with my hair and makeup. She hit it spot on with a beachy romantic hairstyle and a statement peony on the side. The talented designers at Martin Roberts Design created the beautiful soft romantic peony bouquet. Louis dressed the part looking sharp in his blue suit with custom made cuff links reading  lucky me .

The skies were blue, the wind was cleansing and the love between us was undeniable. Our officiant Kelvin spoke such beautiful, heartfelt words during the ceremony rituals. We could not have asked for a better officiant to share this special moment with as we start our lives together as husband and wife. It took our breath away. After the ceremony Blenda, her husband Raymond, Louis and I went to a second location at The Kilohana Plantation to celebrate with champagne and take some fun photos.

They met at Washington University, and decided to take a non-traditional yet glamorous approach to their wedding.  Olivia sparkled in a gold Badgley Mischka gown, holding a bouquet of white peonies, while walking the path to meet her groom right before the ceremony; you could see her classic red lips smiling a mile away. They said their vows in a short ceremony next to a reflecting pool in front of the Jewel Box, a 75-year-old Art Deco greenhouse, accompanied by a few sprinkles, a couple of ducks, and a bunny in the shrubs nearby.  Once their union was made official, all 15 persons had a photo taken to commemorate the event, they shared a toast, and the bride and groom set off to take photos with their two dogs, Argon and Shirley.  The day ended with a warm summer shower and radiant smiles; a lovely story to share with generations to come.'],\n",

Not only is the Legion of Honor an architectural masterpiece, the property has stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the perfect backdrop to a wedding ceremony. Fogust lived up to its name and there was no bridge to be seen during our wedding ceremony but the photos are breathtaking even without the iconic bridge.',\n",

All five bridesmaids picked a different way to wear the dress and had amazing pink and purple bouquets in their hands. Katherine of Cherries made my dream floral arrangements a reality.

The Skirball Cultural Center, like everything else our coordinator recommended, managed to represent both of our visions perfectly. Architecturally modern with an outdoor space complete with a reflection pond and the Santa Monica mountains in the background, we could not have imagined a better venue. Blossom Floral (recommended by Hustle and Bustle), also managed to find the ideal style that fit both Nicole s and my tastes. I wanted a more organic feel to the flowers, and Nicole wanted a more structural arrangement. Blossom Floral created a Chuppah that was at once free flowing and still structured. She met with us numerous times to ensure we would be happy with the design, and did not leave any detail to chance. Because of the art deco theme we were aiming for, we agreed that we wanted a cake that reflected that era. Lark Cake Shop not only had the most delicious cakes we sampled, but also created a beautiful cake for us right out of the 1920s. H&B also recommended we use Theresa Huang for our make-up and hair. We could not have been happier. Theresa Huang understood the art deco look I was going for, and had enough stylists to help Nicole, me, and our bridesmaids all get ready in time for the big day. In fact, all of our bridesmaids ended up getting their make-up and hair done, despite originally planning on only doing their hair. Finally, we worked with the lovely and talented Emily Schwartz to design our save the dates (and eventually our invitations, etc.), and she perfectly encapsulated our art deco style.'],\n",

From the beginning of the relationship, I think both of us sensed that this was a relationship for the long haul. About two and a half years of dating, we both grabbed a drink after a friend s holiday party and started joking about what our wedding would look like. After a few drinks, we both looked at each other and couldn t find any reason to not make it happen right away.',\n",

Spain seemed like a perfect midpoint for my relatives in India and friends in the US, while making it easier for his friends and family to travel. We settled on Marbella, Spain for its proximity to the beach, mountains and the oft-visited sites of Sevilla, Granada and Morocco.'],\n",

We started dating and realized very quickly we were good for each other s soul. We dated for seven years which took us from our hometown Milwaukee, WI to Chicago, IL. Along the way we  grew up  together, became best friends, held each other s hand through really hard times, and supported each other through our greatest successes.

We ve just always been in each other s lives.\\n Daniel s younger sister, Toni was my childhood best friend. Most of my memories of summer vacations, sleep overs, birthday parties, and milestone events include her. And because Toni and Daniel lived 4 blocks away from me, he was always around. In high school, my brother and Daniel also became inseparable, making my existing crush even more intense. Though it was each other s siblings that brought us together, we often found ourselves finding reasons to spend time alone with each other.We bonded over music, books, and movies that were so delightfully dark and intriguing to our burgeoning adolescent tastes. I used every opportunity to seize private moments with Daniel and he searched for the chance to impress me. I remember being at their house for a sleepover with Toni when Daniel walked in her room where we were buried in Seventeen magazines. He interrupted our gossip session for some inane reason that, at the time, seemed legitimate. With an exaggerated cough, Toni pointed out Daniel s excessive use of cologne at 9 PM on a Saturday at home. Of course, to me, his interruption was the best kind of magical.',\n",
        "   'On the day of Toni s wedding, I was shaking with nerves, for so many reasons: my best friend was getting married (try not to ugly cry), I was the MOH (try not to fall on your face), and I was going to see Daniel after more than three years (try not to look stupid, effected, nervous, jealous, etc.) He was an usher at the wedding and was standing in the foyer of the church when the bridesmaids and I walked in to take our places for the ceremony. I looked at him just as he turned to look at me and I silently mouthed,  I m so nervous.  It might seem an odd thing to say to an ex that you haven t seen in so long, but it was a testament to our relationship beyond romance or complications. With comforting familiarity, he replied,  You look beautiful; you ll be great.  That was the moment we first met; at a wedding where we both brought dates, 16 years after I became his sister s best friend, and 3 years after our first kiss.'],\n",

First on the agenda was a date and a venue. Surprisingly, those came easily. We knew we weren t country club, hotel ballroom, yacht club, or beach types and we weren t rugged outdoors types. That certainly limited our options in Los Angeles. But, as soon as we discovered the Smog Shoppe venue with its blank canvas, urban vibe we were sold. Since we live out of town in San Francisco, we knew we needed a wedding planner to coordinate. I found Nira DeLuna of Amber Events and right away I knew her laid back, confident energy was a perfect fit. Nira kept us on track from day one!',\n",

After several trips to department stores and designer boutiques between Los Angeles and San Francisco, I happened on a San Francisco boutique, And Something Blue, which carried Trish Lee, a local designer. As soon as I put on the Trish Lee dress, I knew it was right! I paired it with my grandmother s antique diamond and jade hanging earrings for a pop of color ( something old ) and I had my mother s wedding veil recut for the perfect accompaniment ( something borrowed ).

This began a very organic process of building our design concept; one layer at a time. Together we chose saturated gilded tones of burgundy, mustard, brass, gold, rose gold, dusty rose and corals. The big blooms and whimsical flowers were wrapped in gold for my bouquet. The groom s bout was textures with mustard and burgundy tones.',\n",

Nothing says spring like white tulips, peonies, and ranunculus (bride s favorite flower), which were spread throughout the main gallery floor. To make the grand gallery space feel more intimate, yet still dramatic, we opted for two long king s tables to seat our 175 guests. Perhaps our favorite memory of the day was dancing our first dance, as the Bubbly Creek Band played. Our love for Bluegrass music is something we enjoy as a couple, and their performance was fresh and fun a great way to transition into the party!

We wanted a wedding that would best reflect our relationship of being timeless and traditional, but also fun loving, romantic, and something fresh. We chose to get married at the Ivy Room Chicago as it was important to both of us to have the ceremony outside, but also be located in the heart of our favorite city and home near all of the action. Our officiant was from my church in the suburbs where I have gone my whole life so even though we were not in that particular space it was nice to have a piece of it there with us that day. We absolutely loved all that the Ivy Room had to offer and tried to compliment it with soft pinks (using peonies my favorite flower) and champagne colors and focus on candles and lighting. We wanted to make sure every detail was perfect, yet at the same time did not want to get carried away with too many little things and lose sight of what we were there for. This was especially evident in our guestbook which was done by our photographer to be a book of all of our engagement photos as the pages and our guests could write messages on top of the photos. We really loved how she wanted to capture and show our personality as a couple in both our engagement and wedding photos for our love for each other, Chicago, and our friends and family. '],\n",

It s where we met (eight years ago as seniors in high school!). And it s a city with the most admirable spirit. Not to mention, it s the city that s home to our most beloved family and friends. To me, Saint Louis embodies everything I hoped our wedding would be. Classic, but not too serious. Vibrant. And thoughtful. Maybe even timeless and unforgettable. But mostly, overflowing with joy. Before we could dive into the details (my most favorite part), we had to find the reception venue that would set the tone. It didn t take long to realize that Forest Park Visitor Center was the obvious choice. As the hub of one of the greatest civic treasures of Saint Louis, it did everything it needed to. It was authentic, beautifully constructed, and filled with natural light   the most sincere palette.'],\n",

Our reception venue was a beautiful private home and garden, just minutes from the church, that had exactly the comfortable elegance we were looking for. Since we both seriously lack any artistic talent, we found other ways to add our own personal touches to the reception: a shuck-to order oyster bar (hands down my favorite food), personalized appetizers (fish n  chips and crabcakes, reminiscent of our many trips to Barbara s Fishtrap in nearby Half Moon Bay), a string quartet to play during the cocktail hours (one of our first dates was at the San Francisco Symphony), and his and her signature cocktails (Lauren s classic French 75 and my dirty martini). Our flowers were done by a florist Lauren s family has known since she was a child.

        "   'From Amanda O Creative When I initially met with Naomi and Vic to discuss their vision for their wedding they told me the story of how they ended up dating. They were in college and had been friends for a while but secretly they both had feelings for each other. One night they both had a dream that they kissed! Eventually they told each other about these dreams and of course   started dating soon after! Their dreams, which brought them together, played such an important part of their love story that we knew we had to incorporate them into their wedding design in some way. To help create a romantic, dream-like setting we decided on lots of soft, sunset inspired colors with washes of watercolor to give the design an ethereal vibe. Romantic florals and flowing chiffon framed Naomi and Vic as they exchanged vows overlooking the golden hills of Northern California. Guests found their way to their seats by picking up escort cards which were calligraphed by Naomi s talented bridesmaid. Pieces of sea glass, which brought in a beautiful mint color, served as weights for each card and were also used as sign holders. We incorporated the same mint color and lush florals into their dessert display where a watercolor sign that read  a dream is a wish your heart makes  was framed by greenery and soft pastel flowers. The same lush, romantic pastel flowers were found in the centerpieces and bouquets where pops of gold added just a little bit of sparkle and glam to the outdoor affair.'],\n",

I have been obsessed with wedding since I was little and have been reading wedding blogs and magazines since way before I even met Brian. I knew I wanted something rustic and vintage but I also wanted to try not to do the same thing as everyone else. One of the most important things to me in planning our wedding was that everything reflected us and who we are. I knew immediately that I wanted to use my vintage camera collection and thought that centerpieces would be the best way to use them. But I also wanted to include Brian in them so we decided to use potted herbs because he is a cook and is amazing with seasonings. We both love to read and I love old books so we added those as well as teacups that we collected at thrift stores over the many months before the wedding.',\n",

We met through a mutual friend at a bar near St. Louis University. I was with a big group of friends and for some reason, something inside me told me to find my friend Jarad. When I finally did, I found Jarad talking to Jimmy at the bar. They had not seen each other for a few years since going to school together at Mizzou. The funny thing is, Jimmy hated going to this bar and only went because it was his friend s birthday! Jarad introduced us and when I shook Jimmy s hand and looked into his eyes, it was love at first sight. Cheesy, I know- but it s true! We talked about Cardinals baseball for a long time, and I think I impressed him because we went out on our first date a week later! Over time we found out we had several mutual friends and we even got confirmed in the same church during the spring of 1999. Living minutes away from each other in the same city for 20 years, Jimmy and I often talk about how strange it was that we didn t meet sooner.'],\n",

And what made our wedding day even more special was the fact that it was such a group effort and DIY event with the help of our amazing friends, family and the coordinator Kendle, from Lauren Kendle Events. She was a true life saver! I feel so grateful that everyone was such a huge part of our day. Right from the early stages of planning, we knew we wanted to make sure that it wasn t just a wedding, but a day that really represented us as a couple, and one that celebrated the ranch that I grew up on. Truly every detail and every vendor we chose had a connection with us. Our great friend and unbelievable artist, Katie Kramer, designed our wedding invitations with hand painted details of avocados and palm trees to represent the ranch. Our photographer Whitney turner, a very talented wedding photographer, was an easy choice, not just because she is our friend but also because we knew she would make us feel comfortable. Upon a recommendation from a friend, Nico from NLC productions did our flowers, and I knew he would be great the second I met him! He really blew it out of the park and worked with me on incorporating all those little  ranch style  details I wanted. Many of the details came from things we found on the ranch, such as the hawk and owl feathers used for my bouquet and the guys  boutonnieres, the lavender, and the abalone shells that served as place cards. My brother-in-law built an insane driftwood arch that Nico helped adorn with hanging orchids so dreamy. A jewelry designer from Santa Barbara, Marit Rae, who is a also a friend, made incredible crystal necklaces for the bridesmaids and matching crystal bracelets for my mother, mother-in-law, and flower girl.   During the ceremony, my cousin Max played a couple of Allman Brothers songs on his acoustic guitar, which was another important detail for us because my husband is big into music. The dance floor was hopping because of music from the band,   The Rawhides , who were a huge hit, as well as music from our friend Josh Hartley, who DJ ed the cocktail hour and provided dinner music. Josh was another easy choice since he understood our taste so well. Another easy choice was choosing Country Catering in Goleta. We had a menu of tri-tip, chicken, salad, and veggies, which is our food of choice when friends come over for a BBQ at our house. The whole venue was incredible, largely because of Bella Vista Lighting. They completely transformed the beach, making it look so beautiful and romantic with lighting over the ocean so the waves could be seen at night. In addition, a suspended chandelier hung between two palm trees and was beautiful. Apart from the vendors, we also did a lot of things ourselves. Teddy built a reclaimed wood bar from wood on the ranch, and an awesome tree stump cake stand. I made a giant driftwood heart that turned out to be a great photo op for guests. I strung an abalone shelled garland for the cocktail hour and hand painted signs to direct the guest traffic on the ranch from ceremony to reception. One of my favorite parts were the stamped blankets with the crest from our wedding invitation, which was an awesome idea from a friend. We feel so lucky that we were able to pull off such an incredible day. The ranch is such a special place to us, making it easy and fun to create the wedding we dreamed of, but we really couldn t have done it without the help of our family and friends.\\n'],\n",

Our wedding colors were a neutral palette of champagne and varying light to dark grey tones. We kicked off our theme with miniature letter-pressed Save the Dates and engraved stainless steel formal invitations that I created. Next, we set out to find wedding attire that especially mirrored our aesthetic. My handmade Monique Lhuillier gown (the first dress I tried on) featured an extremely modern, but delicately folded, crumb-catcher bust with a stark contrast of disorganized, silk organza strips fluttering from my waist down to the ground. I wore no jewelry except handcrafted solid sterling silver octopus tentacle earrings   custom made for me by a friend   and my shoes were plain grey suede pumps. My husband s light grey Burberry suit was expertly tailored in SF with a custom made lavender shirt (to match his mother s dress) and an Italian wool pinstripe tie. He wore USA-made Wolverine high top boots, the Archimedes pilot watch my parents gave him as a wedding present and his favorite gentleman s folding knife.

For the floral and d cor, Sharla Flock and her team created loose arrangements consisting of roses, hydrangeas, dahlias, lavender, berries, and pops of greenery. They used lanterns, wine barrels, candles, wooden boxes, mercury vessels, and farm tables to compliment the rustic beauty of the Napa Valley. We wanted to do something fun and different with the escort card table so Sharla placed the cards in wooden crates filled with fresh grapes, which turned out wonderfully. We incorporated those softer tones and the wine country theme of grapes and vines into our paper products as well, which we had an absolute blast designing with Kara Gordon of Magnificent Milestones in Chicago.',\n",
        "   'Our wedding day was truly a family affair, which made it even more special and most importantly, fun! Joe s oldest sister, Jenny, and her band D j  Vu flew in from Chicago to play at our ceremony and reception. Jenny was kind enough to sing my processional song, our unity cup song, first dance, and Joe s dance with his mom. Those are definitely moments that we will cherish for years to come. Joe s other sister, Lauren, who is the owner of LK Events in Chicago, helped us throughout the entire wedding planning process. We were very fortunate to have someone that was so knowledgeable and talented with us every step of the way. When I first moved to Chicago I worked with Lauren on many of her weddings and met some incredible vendors that we knew we wanted to be part of our day. Kristina Carter and Aaron Brouwer of Vrai Photography and the brilliant guys from I Do Films made the trip from Chicago as well. Reverend Nye, who officiated our ceremony, also baptized Joe as a baby, so having him there to marry us was very meaningful.'],\n",
