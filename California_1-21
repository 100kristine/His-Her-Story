S'I recently had the absolute pleasure of meeting Jacin of Lovely Little Details in person, and let me just say, she s just as amazing as you could possibly imagine. So now, when I see a wedding she whipped up like this stunner at The Carneros Inn , I am not surprised in the slightest that all that talent can come from one (spirited) little lady. And when she teams up with the likes of Huckleberry Karen Designs and one love photography, I know the best kind of magic is about to unfold right before my eyes, and that s just what happened right here.'
p67
aS'From The Bride Michael and I share an appreciation for handcrafted cocktails. Our first few dates invariably suffered from an utter lack of flirty banter or free-flowing exchanges. At least until we could turn the night over to the (usually overly detailed) cocktail menu. It worked every time. Because as each night wore on, we would begin to talk deeply, laugh freely and share our genuine selves with each other.'
p68
aS'Naturally, a cocktails theme would be the key inspiration behind our thoughtfully crafted wedding. We were engaged in Napa Valley, a place that radiates romance and where food and drink is appreciated and cultivated as high art.  Almost instantly, we decided that our wedding venue had to be there and so we chose the Carneros Inn, which remained dear to us as our first getaway weekend destination. The site exudes modern simplicity and understated elegance; this backdrop influenced our color palette as well as the overall atmosphere we wanted to achieve on our special day.'
p69
aS'The details planning process was one of my favorite parts of wedding planning. The challenge was to weave in our cocktails theme while ensuring all of the details flowed and complemented each other. Once we decided on the theme, the ideas poured in. I decided to create homemade limoncello as favors and personalized coasters with our favorite cocktail recipes that doubled as escort cards. We would also integrate his-and-hers signature cocktails, oversized martini glasses for the sweets bar and used wine barrels as cocktail tables.'
p70
aS'I try to be crafty, always looking for things to do to post on my blog.  So I tried to incorporate as many D.I.Y. projects that I could with the help from my bridesmaids and the team at Lovely Little Details to bring our ideas to fruition. My first project involved creating gold glitter table numbers, which led me to make the glitter picture frames and glitter ribbon wands. That was when I discovered a recurring theme. Gold glitter and sequins became our accent color and texture, respectively; these were the essential elements that kept our details and d cor cohesive. We then added a gold sequin photo booth backdrop, glitter tape on the stripe straws, decorative sequin pillows for the Adirondack chairs and gold dusted cake pops. The moment we saw the details come together was truly one of the highlights.'
p71
aS'The day was magical, more than I can really put into words. There had never been a time when I was surrounded by all my favorite people in one place and it was an honor to celebrate our commitment in their presence. My best advice to those in the planning process is to take a step back and regroup when things get stressful. And my advice to the bride and groom on the day of is to take a few minutes to be alone with each other, just after the ceremony.\n'

S'This wedding had me at Malibu, but then totally ran away with my heart when I laid eyes on all the gorgeous images from B&G Photography. That s when I knew I was going to fall head over heels in love with this f te. And let me just say, I enjoyed every second of that fall. With Amber Events planning every perfect moment and Peony And Plum making sure pretty blooms covered every nook and cranny   this gallery is officially my dream come true.'
p120
aS'We always knew we would get married somewhere in California, as Leah grew up in Huntington Beach and her (very large) family still remains in the LA/OC area. However, as Brandon s family and most of their collective friends live on the East Coast, we were determined to find a venue that would make the long trip worth while. Cypress Sea cove was a truly hidden gem, we couldn t believe our luck when we stumbled upon it!'
p121
aS'The venue provided a beautiful landscape, perfect for letting us use our creativity and allowing us to implement whatever our hearts (and our wallets) desired. Our rock-star team of Amber, Jen (from B&G Photography), Donna (from Monrose Catering) and Susan (from Peony and Plum), all went above and beyond with every step, we couldn t be happier with how the whole event turned out. The food was spectacular (we ate every bite), the flowers were the perfect balance of rustic yet elegant, the dance floor never died out, and to top it all off we now have tons of photos capturing every moment.'
p122
aS'We still get constant calls from our friends and family saying how lovely the event was, how amazing the food tasted, and how much fun they had. Now we look back though the pictures daily and remember just how amazing the whole experience was, we can t wait for the video!\n'

Under the guidance of Orange Blossom Events and the floral magic of The Little Branch, this wedding had me begging for more. With Birds Of A Feather capturing every picture perfect moment, I ll be going through this gallery again and again and again.'
p156
aS'From Birds Of A Feather  Amy and Peter were inspired by the architecture of Lloyd Wright s Wayfarer s Chapel and built their wedding around the spectacular ceremony site. Peter, an architect himself, designed all the paper goods as an homage to the famed builder s era, using both deco and arts and crafts motifs. Amy looked every inch the classic bride in a stunning 30 s inspired gown. Bright florals by The Little Branch accented the warm reception room at La Venta and guests danced the night away while taking in stunning views of the Pacific from every room.\n'

S'I can t think of a better way to start off the week than with this gem of a wedding film by D.P. Weddings. My heart raced with joy from one beautiful moment to the next at this rustic Californian celebration. So pour yourself an extra cup of coffee and start your day off right with this pretty package of love.'
p184
aS'From D.P. Weddings  A gorgeous bride, a thoughtful groom and the contrast of soft creamy colors and lace against the urban setting of the Mitten Building made for a photographers dream! Lauren was a vision in lace & the details of her oversized bouquet by the talented ladies of Felicity Blooms gave her look such a unique edge! Lauren & James were all smiles all day, and were surrounded by friends & family all full of joy ~ it was a true celebration! Their ceremony was romantically lit inside with an aisle lined with candles, and they were married under a simple and elegant arch. The icing on the cake was the thunderstorm that broke out the final few moments of our bride & groom portraits outside   and was the perfect transition into their indoor reception party!\n'

Off The Beaten Path worked to bring the couple s rustic-boho celebration to life, and the photos from Matt Edge are what wedding dreams are made of. Take my advice and kick off your Friday festivities in the gallery right here.'
p217
aS'From The Bride .We vacationed in Napa Valley a few years ago and we both knew that it was the perfect place for us to get married. The combination of great food, wine, and the picturesque scenery captured our hearts and we knew that this would be the perfect place to start our journey together. Napa has the unique small town feel with all the luxuries of a big city, which made it an ideal destination to host our wedding.'
p218
aS'We kicked off our wedding weekend by having our wedding party join us a few days before to explore the greater Napa area on bikes. We  biked for wine,  traversing Napa s hilly landscape, while visiting several wieners throughout the valley. We capped off our ride with a beautiful lunch on Bell winery s patio.'
p219
aS'One of our favorite memories of our wedding day was our choreographed first dance. The upbeat tempo, friends and family laughing as we did spins and lifts to our favorite song,  Stuck On You,  by Meiko. The setting at Running Pony Farm was sensational, a natural rustic feel, with the white barn giving it a hint of elegance, while the herb garden and peach orchard gave us the subtle outdoor feel. As the sun was setting, the Italian string lighting came alive as we capped off the evening with John s favorite combination, bourbon, fire pits and doughnuts. Thank you to Off the Beaten Path Weddings and Matt Edge photography for helping us coordinate a dream come true.\n'

aS'From Joy Proctor Design  I had the pleasure of helping Corinna and Mark plan and design their intimate wedding at the historic San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California. Nestled in the Santa Barbara foothills, the stunning ranch has been home to some of the most special guests including JFK and Jackie O, who honeymooned there. '
p309
aS'It was important to Corinna and Mark to keep their wedding small, intimate and thoughtful. Their guests were greeted with champagne served in gold rimmed flutes and bocce ball before the ceremony. The grooms brother officiated as the couple exchanged their vows amongst their closest friends and family, who tossed lavender once they were married. Beautiful linen lounge furniture and a garland draped bar created an intimate cocktail hour in the garden, before guests made their way to dinner outside the wine cellar. '
p310
aS'Seating assignments on handmade paper hung from a garden gate, helping guests find their seats. Chandeliers dripping with ivy hung from the trees above a 24  dinner table, set in front of a beautiful stone fireplace. The wooden table was filled with lush floral centerpieces and candle light, truly creating an intimate yet elegant al fresco environment. After dinner, guests made their way inside the wine cellar for dancing and cake.'

aS'From Rebecca Yale Portraits I love nothing more than photographing an amazing party full of great friends, great wine and great food and this one is particularly special to me because it was the welcome dinner kicking off the celebration for my sister s destination wedding weekend in Napa. We chose Grgich Hills Estate, one of our favorite vineyard s in Napa, to host the party and it was the perfect intro to Napa for all of our East Coast friends who had flown in from New York. Not only is Grgich one of the most beautiful vineyards around with the most delectable of wines, but they have a very storied history within Napa. A bottle of 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay, made by Mike Grgich, won the blind Paris tasting in 1973 that put Napa on the map as a world class wine region. Kelly at Grgich helped us create such a lovely evening for our friends and family, which began with a cocktail hour and hors d oeuvres on the patio of the Ranch House. Guests were invited to stomp the grapes (a la Lucy) and taste the grapes that had just been pulled off the vines. Underneath strings of twinkly lights guests dined next to the vineyard and watched as the sun set over the endless rows of vines.'

aS'Upon their arrival in Napa guests were presented with a welcome bag, crafted by Laurie Arons Special Events, containing all of the couple s favorite snacks and essentials for a weekend in wine country including a map of the area, bouchon from Bouchon Bakery and a one day membership pass at Grgich. The totes were perfect to carry around all weekend, perhaps holding a bottle or two of wine purchased at the amazing local vineyards. My sister accessorized for the weekend with the FEED bridal bag, which not only makes a perfect tote for the weekend, but also provides 1 child with micro-nutrient powder for an entire year! It even has cute compartments inside for something old, new, borrowed and blue.\n'

S'I have a feeling I know what Tony Bennett meant when he proclaimed that he left his heart in San Francisco. This classic San Fran affair radiates elegance and glamour and with Huckleberry Karen Designs creating floral magic, my heart is left swooning. Carmen Holt captured every picture perfect moment and I won t be leaving this gallery anytime soon.'
p459
aS'From The Bride In April 2010, I had tickets to the San Francisco Giant s game. Not knowing a thing about the Giant s, I decided to check it out and see them in action. Prior to the game, I went to dinner at a nearby bar, Pete s Tavern, and that is where I met Steven. We ended up talking all night, and needless to say, I never made it into the game!'
p460
aS'Throughout the years, we fell in love and built our lives with the backdrop of San Francisco. When we got engaged, there was no question that we would be married in our beloved city. After looking at a few venues, we decided on the St. Francis Yacht Club due to the breathtaking views of the iconic Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.'
p461
aS'When we sat down to plan our wedding, we both agreed that our number one goal was for everyone to have a fun and memorable night. We are both avid music lovers, so when we met with Andrew Verducci, we knew he was the one to help bring our vision to life. We had themes for every part of the evening to showcase our eclectic taste in music. For example, cocktail hour hailed  Yacht Rock  music from Hall and Oates to The Doobie Brothers. Dinner was filled with 90 s R&B love songs from Babyface, New Edition, and K-Ci & JoJo, and dancing was Top 40 music with Lil Jon, Pink, and Flo Rida bouncing off the walls all night long. Steven s groomsman also rapped  Rapper s Delight  in its entirety, which was one of the highlights of the evening!'
p462
aS'Designing and planning a wedding was such a great process for us. Unlike some brides, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. I spent my nights scouring wedding blogs and building Pinterest boards for inspiration. I wanted to incorporate some DIY elements to personalize our wedding, so I took on the daunting task of making my own pom poms (thank you Martha Stewart for the tutorial), escort cards, wooden signs, photobooth backdrop, and to-go bags for the dessert bar. My husband was nervous about all these DIY ideas, but I was determined to do them myself, even if it meant only a few hours of sleep each night. Of all the projects, the hardest by far was the animal escort cards. I bought plastic animals online, spray painted them gold, and painstakingly cut a slit in each animal s back using a small hand saw (just to be clear, I did about 200 of these). A lot of blisters resulted in this project, but it was definitely a labor of love and in the end, it was worth seeing everything come to fruition.'
p463
aS'A few people asked what our wedding colors were, and to be honest, we didn t really have a particular color scheme. However, we knew we wanted to keep a clean palette with golds, navys, blacks, and creams and have our amazing florals inject pops of color throughout the event space.'
p464
aS'When it came to dessert, we wanted to give our guests a variety of options and offered them copious amounts of lemon bars, whoopie pies, seven layer bars, chocolate chip/sugar cookies, brownies, and some of our favorite candy. And if that wasn t enough, we also had a small two tier peanut butter flavored funfetti cake decorated in Giant s colors, topped with personalized figurines of ourselves donning Giants gear.'
p465
aS'We danced non-stop and closed the night with none other than the Giant s anthem:  Don t Stop Believin    by Journey. It is true what they say: your wedding day will not go according to plan. We had a few minor bumps but the most incredible feeling was experiencing the pure love and happiness that surrounded us that day. To us, it was absolutely perfect.\n'

S'This island wedding is fun with a capital  f  and it has everything to do with the creative gurus behind Amorology. They took the couple s vision for killer party and created a retro Hawaiian, tropical fruit-infused day with color and style like you wouldn t believe. Acqua Photo captured all the goodies, and I suggest you fix yourself a Mai Tai and join me here for so much more.'
p512
aS'From Amorology  Get ready for a taste of the Hawaii life! We love when we get to design for super chic couples who have both a killer personal style and an infectious romance! With Brandi + Tim s love for the island life, we decided to play with a theme that combined Carmen Miranda and retro Hawaiian inspired touches with a dash of old Hollywood glam . Using large palm leaves and mango wood, we created a custom wood backdrop inspired by Hawaiian quilt prints for the escort card display and filled it with the help of JL Designs with the most delicious abundance of tropical fruits. We also painted pineapples to hold table names, made custom wood square candle holders, and had menus created with white calligraphy on palm leaves to perch at each table among the beautiful blooms and transfer ware blue china. For favors, we shipped in our couple s favorite cookies from Hawaii and packaged them in pineapple-printed muslin bags.'
p513
aS"Our couple danced to Marvin Gaye s  Let s Get it On  for their first dance and heated up the room. After dinner, guests sipped on Mai Tai s and treated themselves to the sugar shack dessert display with the most darling quilt inspired cake by Hey There -Cupcake. With straw hats and coconut bras we kept things playful on the dance floor as guests busted a move. We were so happy to see that our design resonated with the couple s sense of style so well. As the groom said,  We were so impressed with their [Amorology's] ability to transform our vague ideas into vibrantly crafted and vintage Hawaiiana style that represented us perfectly. "
p514
aS'Brandi and Tim and their weding is near and dear to our hearts for so many reasons but we especially loved that our sweet couple in need of a flower girl, asked Heather s little daughter, Milla to play the part and on her birthday! Growing up in a world full of brides, this was the pinnacle! Lots of dreams coming true on this wedding day!\n'

S'Inspired by her Groom s homeland of England, this Santa Monica bride infused their wedding with chic nods to UK culture. From the floral china patterns to the quiet garden vibe, it s a fusion of English charm and California cool with coordination by WINK! and a must-see cake from our friends at The Butter End. Anna Delores snapped it all behind the lens, and there s SO much more in the gallery right here.'
p557
aS'From The Bride With so many of our guests traveling from far, we made the decision early on to have our wedding in Santa Monica where Phil and I met and where we currently live. It made the experience so much more special because we were inviting our loved ones in to our home and neighborhood.'
p558
aS'Phil is from England, and having recently spent time in the UK I was instantly inspired by British tradition and pop culture- floral china patterns, milk glass, blush and mint color palette, english garden roses, Rolls Royce, Abbey Road (Beatles album cover for groom s photo), and our signature drink Pimm s Cup. Likewise, keeping true to LA I also pulled inspiration from Hollywood glamour/Gatsby inspiration   gold accents, sequins and speakeasy 1930 s inspired bar areas.'
p559
aS'Tiato provided a modern twist and the perfect raw setting to play with, with all the natural wood, raw concrete floors, industrial elements and lighting, and a chic bar. Succelents were added in to the floral arrangements and grooms party boutineers.'
p560
aS'I wanted the ceremony to feel traditional and romantic, yet updated and chic. We used an assortment of chairs- vintage round back linen chairs, tufted benches, and traditional church pews, mixed in with more modern bistro chairs. Our alter provided a modern back drop- geometric wooden structure, clean lines, dressed with eucalyptus seed.'
p561
aS'I wanted dinner, which took place in the garden, to feel like an updated version of a vintage tea party. A vintage credenza was used for the tea station paired with vintage tea cups and saucers for guests to enjoy. We placed vintage settees and chairs adjacent to the tea station to create a  tea room. '
p562
aS'Our cake table was a long wooden table with a metal frame and industrial legs, and was dressed with vintage tea trays and mirrors. Our reception took place inside. Our Marquee Lights were the focal point for a touch of Hollywood glamour in a cool industrial setting. Our invitations were mint with a cascading wave pattern and gold foil accents for a vintage glamour feel. We continued this branding in our table numbers and place cards, as well as the custom wooden signs created for the program and menu.'
p563
aS'The best advice I could give is have fun and allow yourself enjoy the process. We never took ourselves too seriously or cared what people would think. We tried hard to always keep perspective so that if an idea became too big, we would step back and drill down to basics.'
p564
aS'This year leading up to the wedding has been the best year of my life. I think this is why Phil and I had an absolute blast the day of. We couldn t be more happy and also super proud.\n'

That love, it s evident in every happy corner, every sweet smile, and every close embrace in the imagery captured by Matt Edge and the cheerful film Reel Eyes Media. Have a peek at the gallery for even more.'
p606
aS'From Matt Edge Wedding Photography The bride, Paige, really wanted the venue to shine, as she has family in Sonoma County, so Chalk Hill winery held a special place in her heart due to the location. An equestrian at heart, she fell in love with the reception venue being a true dressage arena. After that, she just added little touches like the tribute to their mom s in the gold flamingos flanking the ceremony space, and the floating baby s breath in the reception space. The sequined linen s glammed up the space and created a beautiful juxtaposition in a space not primarily used for events. The awesome 80 s tribute band, the Spazmatics, ended the evening with everyone dancing.\n'

aS'From The Bride Mitch and I met over ten years ago at the end of high school. We weathered a long distance relationship through college while he was in Annapolis, Maryland at the Naval Academy and I was swimming in literature studying English at Berkeley.'
p646
aS'Mitch and I both love the outdoors, a tasty nibble and drink, music, and our friends and family, so we immediately knew we wanted our wedding to incorporate all of these. When we found Beltane Ranch in Glen Ellen, California, we knew it would perfectly deliver the ambiance we imagined with its gnarled giant oaks and rolling golden hills. Mitch and I love the outdoors, a tasty nibble and drink, music, and our friends and family, so we immediately knew we wanted our wedding to incorporate all of these. When we found Beltane Ranch in Glen Ellen, California, we knew it would perfectly deliver the ambiance we imagined with its gnarled giant oaks and rolling golden hills.'
p647
aS'From there, planning was a breeze because we kept things simple. The scenery was already so beautiful, that we didn t need much decor; however, the flower centerpieces and bouquets designed by our florist Natalie from Belle-Flower were absolutely gorgeous. Her artistry added another level of beauty to the already breathtaking ranch. Our caterer, Park Avenue Catering, is the first Green Certified catering company in Napa and Sonoma counties, and their farm to table meal was fresh, delicious, and served beautifully.'
p648
aS'Music was also very important to us, so I spent a lot of time creating the perfect playlists for each aspect of the wedding and selecting our special songs. For our first dance, we chose  Moon River,  the theme song from my favorite movie  Breakfast at Tiffany s.  Sung by Audrey Hepburn, the song is so raw and emotional to me, and it perfectly describes the feelings Mitch and I have starting our lives together.'
p649
aS'My favorite moment of the wedding   besides our vows   was our last dance. The entire evening was truly brimming with fun, happiness, and love, and our last dance was an overflowing of these feelings. Dancing to Wilco s  California Stars,  a favorite song of ours, we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of a giant, group  dance-hug.  In that moment, I felt so overwhelmingly joyful, surrounded by the love of our friends and family. It was the perfect beginning to our new life.'
p650
aS'A huge thank you to all of our wonderful vendors, especially our coordinator, Lindsey, from Ooh La La Weddings for allowing us to truly relax and enjoy our day and to our incredibly talented photography team Tommy and Connie of The Great Romance Photo for exquisitely capturing the essence of the day for us to treasure forever.\n'

S'Holly Farm emits a coziness that lures you in and wraps you up in love at least that s the effect it has on me, every single time. With it s lush greens stretching their palms and leaves out in every direction and hugging every portrait from Lisa Lefringhouse, this vintage fete has a sweet sass that ll keep you coming back for more. From the Bride s hot red lip to the mix-matched coral  maids, you can find it all here.'
p693
aS'From the beautiful Bride As soon as Nick and I walked into The Holly Farm, we knew it was the venue for us. Nick is a New Yorker and I grew up in Berkeley. We met in San Francisco and I brought him to Carmel many times during our 6 years of dating in the hopes that the stunning coastline and valley would convince him to stick around the west coast for a while. Carmel is a special place for my family because my great grandparents built a home there in the 40s. Since then, many couples in my family have been married in the area, including my parents, who happened to buy their wedding cake from the previous owner of the Holly Farm over 30 years ago!'
p694
aS'Inspired by the rose gold art deco engagement ring that Nick designed for me, we went for a vibrant, vintage feel while embracing the rustic charm of the Holly Farm. Nick is colorblind so he let me choose our palette. I love bright colors and shades of coral, turquoise and gold seemed just right in the gardens. We asked our bridesmaids and groomsmen to choose their own dresses and suits for a mismatched and fresh look. We didn t work with a planner so we kept the decor simple and let the luscious venue and Kate Healy s homegrown flowers do most of the work.'

aS'Our dear friend Ali married us in a very personal ceremony under the oak tree. We passed our rings around as we said our vows and asked all our guests to bless them before we sealed the deal. We spent the rest of the day grinning our faces off, filled to the brim with love for each other and all of the friends and family who came to celebrate with us.\n'

S'One of the things we preach on SMP is to always make your wedding your own. And this gorgeous, glowy, ridiculously joy filled bride and groom did just that. From the hymns chosen to the milk and cookies they served instead of the cake, every last detail allowed their story to unfold. And the photos by Anna Delores give us a perfect glimpse into all of the lovely. And there is more here!'
p735
aS'From The Bride The theme and decor for the wedding wasn t really shaped around one idea in particular, since I am pretty indecisive. After a lot of changing my mind I decided I wanted to have a combination of decor ideas that reflected us as a couple, showed our love for Jesus, and included members of our family. Thanks to wonderful loved ones, we pulled off a DIY wedding that was extremely personal!'
p736
aS'For the ceremony we had JJ s uncle marry us, and two of our good friends sang one of my mom s favorite hymns during communion. For reception decor I hoped for a neutral color palette, and we added navy blue (JJ s favorite color) for accents. For the seating arrangements, we turned an alphabet song that JJ s grandma taught him into the table assignments, and made each table correspond to the letter/verse of the song. We served milk & cookies for dessert because neither of us like cake, and we wanted something fun and whimiscal! I designed the paper goods and signage for the ceremony and reception, and Kindred did our wedding invitations.'
p737
aS'JJ s dad cut and made each birch candle holder for us. We added antlers from the family collection to pay homage to Idaho, where JJ is from. One of my friends, Jenna, did the floral arrangements, and her sister (Alexandra, co-founder of Kindred) designed our invitations. It was amazing to see everyone s efforts come together to create the perfect setting with such special details!'
p738
aS'The whole day was a whirlwind of intimate and memorable moments. Some of my favorites were our first look, taking pictures with our bridal party, and right when the barn door opened for me to walk down the aisle. The celebration of such a sacred union, combined with having everyone you love in one room, and seeing all of your hard work come together makes for one heck of a day. But the best days come after!\n'

Complete with a sparkly Monique Lhuillier gown for the Bride, shiny black Louboutin s for the Groom and set at the very fitting Taglyan Complex, every pretty portrait in the gallery from Mimi Nguyen is surely a blush inducer.'
p766
aS'From Vivian Tran Ngo I ve known Nguyet for a good amount of years and when she approached me to plan hers and Nien s wedding, I felt so honored. These two amazing people have been together for years. I think of them as the Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie of Orange County; a great looking power couple with such a humble upbringing and down to earth personalities. I wanted nothing more than to help plan a breathtaking wedding for these two. We searched far and wide for the perfect venue, and the couple stumbled upon the Taglyan Complex. I would describe it to be somewhat of a diamond in the rough (being hidden in the midst of Hollywood). It was the perfect venue to portray their old Hollywood inspired wedding. From her Monique Lhuillier Wedding gown, to being escorted in a vintage car, to the luscious overflow of flowers, it was definitely something that you can imagine on the Big Screen. At the end of the night, it was truly was a blessing to witness such an amazing love between two people.\n'

S'We ve seen our fair share of al fresco lovefests, but there s something about this garden affair that takes California pretty to a whole new level. Simple yet chic, Coastyle Events crafted a day filled with lush greens by Feather Acres and contemporary touches. Combined with the talent of Troy Grover behind the lens and video captured by Ren emudd, you can guarantee that every moment will be beautiful.'
p803
aS'From Troy Grover Photographers A wish-I-was-there type of wedding. From the moment you entered the lush gardens, you immediately felt the warmth and love dedicated to the details of the nuptials, paired with a contagious energy from all of the friends, family and bridal party (there were 24!) gathered to celebrate the adorable couple.'
p804
aS'The wedding was simple, yet elegant, pulling in old elements like the bride s grandma s 1940 s cake topper with contemporary touches of woodfired pizza, long, ticking-striped runners & branded, san-seriffed stationery. Much of it was the DIY handy work of the bride and her mother, and far from looking DIY at all. The bride designed all of the wedding stationery, made the farm-to-table runners, modern table numbers, and dusted every mid-century modern pizza stand with a fabulous gold finish. The bride s mother arranged the bridal party s bouquets along with the boutonnieres and was the vision behind the amazing oversized lanterns that paved the aisle to the old fern that covered the alter.'
p805
aS'The ceremony was serenaded with live music from the bride s two uncles and sister who s 3-part harmony was nothing short of incredible, which set the mood for the entire evening.'
p806
aS'As the evening transitioned into a gazebo lit reception stranded with whimsical market lights, the remainder of the night was idyllic  speeches-epic, dance party-unbeatable, and happy couple? Just watch the video  quite possibly the happiest newlyweds you ve ever seen!'

S'I adore watching wedding videos. But to be able to watch your video, on your actual wedding day, makes my sentimental heart skip a beat. Amari Productions captured the beautiful wedding of this adorable couple and shared it with everyone there for a same day premiere! Imagine watching and realizing the fun gets to continue right where the film leaves off; I can t think of a better happy ending.'
p836
aS'From Amari Productions  They couldn t stop smiling. As soon as Caryn & Zane saw each other they lit up with these big, beautiful, genuine, joyful smiles. They were the kind of smiles that you could see, and knowing nothing else about the couple, know they were madly in love. They were the best kind of smiles, and they never left for the rest of the day.'
p837
aS'To cap off this wonderful wedding, we had the honor of showing a Same Day Premiere. If you ve never heard of a Same Day Premiere, it is exactly as its name implies. We edit and show your wedding film AT YOUR WEDDING. How? Well, think of a top hat. Now, imagine a magician (complete with coattails and a curly mustache if you will) pulling a rabbit out of said hat. Got that? Ok, replace the rabbit in that scenario with a wedding film and that s pretty much how it happens.'
p838
aS'Same Day Premieres are one of our favorite types of wedding films. Everyone is right when they say your wedding day is going to fly by. So we love being able to sit you down with all of your family and friends surrounding you so that you can see what the heck just happened! (Spoiler alert: YOU GOT MARRIED!) Then (and this is the ultimate kicker), after the film ends and you re thinking to yourself,  Wow, this really has been the BEST DAY of my life , the lights come back on and you realize: YOU RE STILL THERE! Your parents, your bridal party, your best man and maid of honor, everyone that matters to you most is still there, ready to make more memories together.'

p899
aS'From The Bride  Jason and I are San Francisco residents, but our love story began in San Diego. It only made sense for us to incorporate it in a special way, which is why we chose to do our wedding / engagement shoot there. We wanted the shoot to feel fun, playful, and maybe even surprising; thus, pajamas and donuts outdoors was something that was easily agreed on! Carmen, our photographer, is owed the credit for suggesting the dock by the lake. Per her suggestion we chose San Marcos Lake as our location. We also wanted to do something with formal-wear in a contrasting setting and the San Marcos Lake area kindly obliged with its desert-like surroundings. We re not an overly  cutesy  couple, so I loved the way Carmen was able to capture our not-so-mushy personalities and the less traditional nature of the shoot while still giving them a romantic vibe!\n'

aS'From the beautiful Bride  Nate and I had visited a number of locations in LA and Palm Springs and didn t have that feeling that they were  the  location until we went to the Viceroy Palm Springs. Everything felt right from the moment I started emailing with Olivia Prescott (Director of Events) to our site visit and follow ups. They were so welcoming, courteous, nice and treated our bulldog, Chief, like a king when on our initial site visit. We knew we wanted to incorporate him into the wedding and the Viceroy was the only location that treated him like he was part of our family and that it wouldn t be a burden to have him at the property or in the wedding. There wasn t any extra pressure to rent out the entire hotel (like several other locations) and we could really customize it to be the wedding we were envisioning. We both loved the coziness and serene feeling we had walking through the property and the Palm Springs backdrop was to-die for! We decided on our drive home that it was the place where we had to get married and worked on convincing our close family to a destination wedding. Couldn t have imagined getting married anywhere else.'
p968
aS'We hadn t started looking into planners until we officially booked The Viceroy Palm Springs and my best friend has used Joey and Artisan for her wedding at the Parker Palm Springs and the Viceroy said if the Artisan team was available on our wedding date, that they were the team to use for everything. I met Joey when I was a bridesmaid for my best friend s wedding and had that feeling again after speaking with him about how I envisioned our wedding day and knew he and the team were reliable, professional and the team that could bring all of our ideas to life. They were flexible, welcoming of new ideas and problem solvers for everything that came along leading up to and on the wedding day. All of our guests were so amazed by the beautiful wedding we had created and heard over and over again from them that it was the most beautiful and classy wedding they had ever been to.\n'

aS'From The Bride We chose a family home for our wedding and it was intimate, romantic, and had a killer mountain/valley view. We have backgrounds in art and flowers and wanted to infuse that into our decor. Woodland Watercolor best describes our wedding style. Before the wedding, we had help from bridesmaids and friends to create hand dyed napkins & table runners. My ladies even helped to create lots of little geometric shapes for a modern accent to the decor.'
p1009
aS'As a floral designer, flowers were very important! I opted to keep things low and lush which showed off the beautiful spring blooms and the setting. I put together the floral arrangements and bouquets with help from some of my closest friends and bridesmaids. Then there was our ceremony! I had my heart set on a reclaimed wood wall backdrop. This was the groom s project! After finding reclaimed wood at local shops, Tyler and his groomsmen Chris set to work on building. Our cousins jumped in to help paint- it truly was a family affair!'
p1010
aS'We used garden roses, peonies, tulips, delphinium, and loads of spring blooms. I scoured the grounds and foraged for specialty foliage, lilacs, and hellebores. I had the bridesmaids select unique dresses they liked within our color palette. That way, they would all feel comfortable and beautiful. They looked great! Each bridesmaid carried a unique bouquet to compliment their dress.'
p1011
aS'The groomsmen wore a more casual look with vests, colored shirts, pants, and dark camel colored accessories. Our boutonnieres had a playful and romantic look with petite garden roses and gold painted animals. I wore an ivory silk Tadashi Shoji dress and carried a bouquet of juliet garden roses with delphinium, spring blooms, and foliage.'
p1012
aS'The hutch that served as our dessert station was made by a local wood-worker from 100+ year old cabin and barn wood. Tyler has a love for history and sweets, so this was a perfect way to display the goods! We wanted our wedding to be intimate- to reflect both of our styles, and to involve our closest friends and family. We ended up with a comfortably small guest count which promoted lots of quality time and laughter.'
p1013
aS'At the end of our ceremony we performed a  hand fasting.  It is an old traditional wedding ceremony where your family and friends fasten ribbons around the hands of the betrothed. Our guests formed a circle which we walked around- this enabled us to spend a moment with each person- we really felt the love! The hand fasting ceremony was beautiful and special. We had the chance to touch everyone at the start which made the whole day feel personal and intimate.'
p1014
aS'Our first look was so sweet and romantic! I literally buried my head in my bouquet from shyness. Pinning my groom with his boutonniere was also special. I pin lots of boutonnieres, but this one will always be my favorite. We loved having our dog, Zeus, there to celebrate. He s a special little guy with loads of personality. I know we ll love the photos of him on that day forever.'
p1015
aS'Having our family and friends there and so willing to help will always touch us. I will cherish the memory of my junior bridesmaids stopping by for hugs and running off to dance with bouquets. Our photo booth was a great tool- everyone stopped in for photos with silly props. Be inspired! Don t be afraid to reach for big ideas. Any idea, big or small, can be translated into something special. Pick a few things that excite and reflect you- whether it be animals, travel, impressionist art, color, or food. Bounce those small, obscure ideas around and a concrete look will start to form. Talk it out- talk to a coordinator or designer. Involve friends and family when you can. Let people know how you want things to look and feel. They may think of something new and amazing that brings your vision to life. Ask for help. DIY projects, sourcing, referrals. All of these can be made easier by the efforts of professionals and friends.'

aS'Have fun! Weddings are stressful, but remember what it s about. After all the build up and planning, let go and know that your day is going to be exactly as it should be. Beautiful and probably imperfect. You re going to remember the important details- the look in his eyes when he saw you, those annoying nervous giggles, speeches that surprise you (in a good way), your little cousin initiating a dance off. Take part, be present, and enjoy. What s perfect anyway?!\n'

S'We re big fans of tradition  round these parts. Especially when couples infuse their own new traditions into their Big Day, like these two lovebirds. From passing their rings around to guests at the ceremony for blessings and well wishes, to giving their mothers arrangements of lush blooms that they symbolically combined into one, they injected a deep meaning and powerful love into every moment. Head to the full gallery from Heidi Ryder Photography for more.'
p1048
aS'From Heidi Ryder Photography Candice and Perry s day was full of so much emotion and love and incorporated all kinds of beautiful elements that added meaning to every part of the day. Even details such as the table numbers held tons of meaning, as they were empty bottles that guests were asked to fill with notes of advice, wisdom and encouragement for the couple to read on the anniversary that corresponded with the number on the bottle. Such a sweet and simple idea that will keep on giving!'
p1049
aS'The ceremony was one of the most beautiful and emotional that I ve had the pleasure of photographing. Candice and Perry s rings were placed into a small hollowed out book and passed from guest to guest while readings and vows were read. Having the couple s family and friends warm their rings and bless them with well wishes and prayers heightened the meaning of a wedding ceremony and got everyone involved.'
p1050
aS'In addition to bridesmaids, Candice had  flower maids  whom walked down the aisle with two small flower arrangements and handed one each to both Candice and Perry s mothers sitting at the end of the aisle. During the ceremony, Candice and Perry collected these flowers from their mothers and created one large and beautiful flower arrangement together. This took the place of a traditional candle lighting or sand ceremony and was a beautiful metaphor for the combining of two families.'
p1051
aS'This lovely pair met on match.com and custom match books were placed at each table setting where guests were reminded that Canidce and Perry  met their match.  During the reception wine and tears of joy continued to flow before the dance floor filled up until the end of the night.\n'

S'When you start to peel away all the layers of gorgeous in this ridiculously beautiful Sonoma soiree, you realize that because of all the personal and heartfelt touches dreamt up by this darling couple, you ve started to love it like it was your very own wedding. Every sweet senitment tucked into this gallery beautifully captured by Josh Gruetzmacher Photography makes you fall in love with not only the wedding but the couple, leaving us with a wedding too special not to share.'
p1099
aS'Cornerstone provided the perfect modern storybook backdrop for our wedding with its beautiful gardens, lily pond, and rustic barn, with a fun twist of modern eclecticism in the form of unique outdoor sculptures, many of which were interactive. We simply added a dash of greenery, a mix of soft pastel florals, oodles of flowy tulle, and a bit of quirky stationary, and we had our own modern day fairytale wedding.'
p1100
aS'Tim and I knew that if we were going to have a full-blown wedding instead of eloping, that we wanted to use it as an opportunity to invite our guests into our life together as a couple. We had guests who had known us since the day Tim and I met in the dorms of UC Berkeley to friends of our parents who hadn t seen us since we were children. Regardless of their roles in our lives, we were so grateful for every guest that could celebrate with us and in return, we want them to feel closer to us on our special day.'
p1101
aS'To that end, we made picture storyboards for each of the different stages of our 8 year relationship   starting from when we met in undergrad, to when Tim moved to Honolulu for medical school while I was in Los Angeles for pharmacy school, to all of our international adventures and then finally the proposal.'
p1102
aS'We also integrated some of our journey into the decorations that we set up in the gardens, such as the wooden directional sign that pointed to all of the cities we had lived and were going to live in (we moved cross-country to New York the week after we got married!). We also shared more intimate details, like the phrase  I love you. I love you more. I love you mostester. Rawr,  that was strung along the bushes leading guests to the ceremony site. It was our nightly ritual to say these words to each other before bed during our four years of long distance.'
p1103
aS'Then we sprinkled the day with details that just made Tim and me giddy. For me, I opted to serve pie instead of traditional wedding cake since that was a tradition in my family when we celebrated special events   birthday pies were the best! Tim elected to have the bar serve Abita beer since he went to high school in Louisiana where Abita beverages are a local favorite.\n Most memorable moment of your wedding day?'
p1104
aS'The most memorable moment was definitely our vows. After being together for 8 years, you would think we knew everything about each other and there really wouldn t be much else new to say, but when Tim opened up his little green book and started reading his vows to me that day, it was so raw, intense, and vulnerable that at that instant I could feel all 8 years of our love crystallized into that one moment. I could not have felt more love and in love at that moment.'
p1105
aS'Our advice for planning is 1. Make a wedding website together. Tim and I had a lot of fun working on our website together as a couple. Tim had given me free leeway to plan the wedding however I pleased (as long as I stuck to the budget), so I loved that this was a pre-wedding project that we were able to work on as a couple. Rummaging through old photos from our earlier years and spending the time to write out our story and proposal together gave us an opportunity to pause in the middle of all the wedding planning chaos and be nostalgic for a moment. We were also excited to showcase our engagement photos from Josh that we loved so much. Practically speaking, the website also provided useful information for guests, so it was a win all around.\n We used Wix, which worked out great since it was free and gave us the flexibility to really customize the site to our liking (http://timandbrittany.wix.com/love).'
p1106
aS'2. Speaking of Josh, it s so important to choose a photographer that puts you at ease. Tim and I must have interviewed at least a dozen photographers, all with great profiles, but Josh s cheerful smile, sweet disposition, and dork-tastic personality ultimately won us over. These characteristics definitely made a huge difference on the final images he captured. For any Friends fans, Tim has the Chandelier Bing curse   where a handsome guy can turn into an incredibly awkward-smiling stranger in front of a professional photographer. I was worried that this would happen during our engagement session, but Josh had us laughing and enjoying ourselves the entire time, which came through in the pictures.'
p1107
aS'3. Hire a videographer. Tim was originally on the fence about hiring a videographer, but probably gave in because he knows I have horrible memory and would need video evidence that we got married. Hands down, one of the best decisions we made. It s wonderful to be able to re-watch such a happy day.'
p1108
aS'Enjoy the ceremony. I feel like the ceremony is always the highlight of the day. It s not about the location or decorations, but rather the people, the vows, and the moment. Everything else that follows during the day is just icing on the cake, or in my case, meringue on the pie!\n'

aS'From Jacque Lynn Photography  This engagement session was styled by Ginny Au, and took place on the dark beach of Elk, CA. I loved the intimate feel of just the two of them and the windy beach.

S'Y all know we re never ones to pass up on a day of pretty, and this Saturday is certainly no exception. We ve got a full schedule of bridal gorgeousness thanks to Jacque Lynn Photography and her snaps straight from the Erich McVey Workshop. I m talking one drool-worthy shoot after another, and we re kicking things off with two oceanside sessions that ll make your morning a whole lot lovelier.'
p1194
aS'From Jacque Lynn Photography  This shoot was styled by Ginny Au, called Whelve. Ginny used words as inspiration for each section of our shooting to describe how the shoot should feel.  To bury something deep to hide . She wanted a very deep feel to the shoot and styling, and completed the look by putting our bride in a Houghton NYC gown, gold metallic flakes in her hair, and a gorgeous natural stone ring. Florals were by the talented Sarah Winward, Hair/MU was Mimi & Taylor.'

aS'From Jacque Lynn Photography  This series of images took place on the dark, rocky beach of Elk, CA. Ginny Au styled the session, and used the word  Arcadian  as her inspiration. Ideal, innocent, stylistic. The wind on the beach of Elk perfectly complimented the feel of the shoot by creating movement to our model s gown and hair. The gown (Rubicon NYC) was perfectly complimented by beach wood, florals by Sarah Winward, and hair/makup by Mimi & Taylor.'

p1233
aS'From Luxe Events .Vita & Simon came to us wishing for a Garden Bohemian wedding design with some Moroccan influenced undertones. The rustic vineyard was the perfect backdrop to bring in color and gardeny goodness. To create the effortless but fancied up boho look we mixed unique elements such as colored goblets, crystal vases, brassy urns and and candlesticks holding vibrant jewel tone flowers and lush greenery. Stunning patterned linens in shades of gray, dusty lavender, and cream host the colorful table settings. Dark wood chairs, vintage wood handled utensils, and the rustic vineyard itself add a masculine balance to the bright color palette. We wanted some fancier finishes on the settings, and selected gold rimmed wine glasses and chargers to amp up the fancy factor. Vita had a vision for a unique chandelier. When we could not find just the right thing we enlisted Tam to create the perfect addition to the wedding, a stunning bougainvillea filled floral chandelier that serves as the centerpiece of the reception.'
p1234
aS'From Isari Flower Studio Vita wanted to be standing under a rustic arbor dripping with vines and bougainvilleas, she selected one of our that was featured on SMP, a beach stylize photo shoot, which looks so dreamy. However once we knew she was exchanging her vow in front of that rolling hills and vineyard back drop of Orfila it was going to be magical! Befitting the landscape yet bold enough that it lends a beautiful focal during the ceremony, the 2 aisle entrance arrangements was also an interpretation of a large combination of similar theme blooms to welcome guests and wedding party to frame.'
p1235
aS'The reception area in the tent emphasize a bohemian yet regal vibe, with her color choices of bold purples using summer dahlias, magenta shade clematis, ruffled garden roses, deep and saturated late summer hydrangeas, hot pink roses lush greeneries off set with peach shade spray roses, trailing vines and berries for textural interest. The eclectic long table scape of multiple pieces of silver and gold elegant vintage goblets, containers, pitchers etc. combined with silver and Florentine trays surrounded with gold kissed votive cups add a touch of european romance to the evening. The large floral wreath hanging from the center of the dance floor, and the dessert table spread with florals and vines ends the evening on a rustic note.\n'

S'This wedding is stunning. It s the kind of wedding that will stick with you for hours, if not days   all the beautiful rustic, yet elegant details dancing in your head until you ve pinned every beautiful image from Carlie Statsky in this gallery. It s easy to get lost in the stunning florals from Fionna Floral or the one-of-a-kind setting of the Holman Ranch, but then when you dig a little deeper and get into the soul and story of this wedding, you realize it s so much more beautiful than you could have every imagined.'
p1277
aS'A good man has always told us  classy never goes out of style  this was continuously on our minds as we envisioned our picturesque ceremony, and created the romantically elegant reception, which turned into an all out love fest. The vision was ever evolving throughout the planning process, but the overall theme was to put Holman Ranch center stage with subtle or maybe not so subtle touches of extravagance to set the day apart. We included special sentimental touches like having the vintage car Renee s parents drove away in at their wedding in the background, fabric hearts sewn on blankets for the guests made from our grade school uniform pattern, and Mike s ring being made to match his dad s ring. We always kept our guests in mind and did our best to make sure there was something for everyone. Our goal was always to have everyone leave with a full belly and a huge smile on their face. A big thanks to all of our vendors and Amy Byrd s team for making our vision come to fruition!\n'

S'Not only is this wedding super charming and filled with heart-felt details (the Bride wore her mother s wedding shoes!), but it was also planned in three months AND on a budget. You read that right. Three months. On a budget. It s pretty spectacular if you let it sink in for a minute. Particularly when the images below from Closer to Love Photography paint a beautiful picture of what obviously the best day ever for every single person in attendance. See even more here.'
p1384
aS'We are coming up on 9 months of marriage bliss and had a-week-shy of THREE months to plan our wedding!! Oh, and did I mention that we had 316 confirmed guests attending? Just typing that out almost gives me a panic attack! But truth is, when I found the rare Prince I ve been waiting my whole life for, waiting 3 months to be his Mrs. actually seemed too long!'
p1385
aS'We have a story that feels like it s straight from the storybooks. (Sure, I m a little biased), but sit down with me over a cup of piping hot tea (preferably using my sweet mama s collection of eclectic English tea cups) and you will see what I mean :)'
p1386
aS'We met two summers ago, July 2011, on a mission trip to Moldova, a third-world country in Eastern Europe, which is next-door to Romania (my parents emigrated from Romania to escape communism in 1983, while Adrian was born and raised there until he 17 years old). We were both there on that trip, a world away, back in 2011 doing what we are both passionate about: serving others, especially those who have lost their mommas (as we both have).'
p1387
aS'As a side note: Adrian and I are both Romanian, hence the reason we had a  small  wedding of 316 guests! Picture  My Big Fat Greek Wedding  only with Romanians :) Remember Toula s run-away grandma from the movie?  yea I m pretty sure I spotted her at our wedding a few times!'
p1388
aS'I had decided to go to Moldova that summer of 2011 to work with the young orphaned girls, and mostly to share the Pearl Story with them. The illustration of how a beautiful pearl is formed inside the shell of certain types of oysters as a defense mechanism against pain/irritation was something near and dear to my heart ever since the summer before that, 2010, after losing my mom to pancreatic cancer.'
p1389
aS'As fate would have it, Adrian, whom I met for the first time on the trip, had decided to return to Moldova for his second summer in a row in 2011 (to work with the young men and orphans, who always had a special place in his heart since he himself had tragically lost his mom when he was 5 years old).'
p1390
aS'While on this trip, I observed at a distance the way Adrian selflessly loved those around him, and apparently he was observing me too (I was pretending not to notice. ha) :) After exchanging only a handful of conversations together throughout the trip, we each went back to our little corners of the world after the trip had come to an end: me to my beautiful hometown of Portland, Oregon and Adrian to Huntington Beach, California.'
p1391
aS'Long story short, less than a year later, I took a job in Southern California, and in April 2012, we had our first date: bike riding in Huntington beach. It didn t take long for us to realize we were perfect for each other. (Our engagement photos having a tea party and bike riding in Huntington Beach will be posted in another submission I will be doing for SMP. In case you can t wait until then, I will post the link the our photographer, Closer to Love s blog here though so you can get a sneak peak: http://www.closertoloveblog.com/blog/2012/11/9/monica-adrian-engaged-huntington-beach-ca.html'
p1392
aS'Adrian proposed on September 21, 2011 in La Mission, Mexico on yet another mission trip we went on to serve the orphans there, and were soon married on December 15, 2012 in Seal Beach, CA.'
p1393
aS'I thank God for Adrian everyday. He is the most wonderful person I have ever met, and inspires me to be a better person everyday! He truly is my hero!'
p1394
aS'Wedding Details Our d cor inspiration comes from our love for everything antique, and just the right balance of simplicity and elegance. Since I was a little girl, I admired my mother s collection of English tea cups, along with her own love for vintage d cor. In her honor, I decided to incorporate her eclectic English tea cups (both in the engagement shoot and at the wedding) and lots of lush Victorian lace, which contrasted so nicely with the earthy feel of burlap against a neutral color palette. We had white vintage Italian chairs upholstered in burlap and used a lot of vintage books and birdcages, as well as mercury class candle sticks to hold our simple yet elegant flower arrangements at the wedding and reception. We also tried to incorporate many Romanian traditions into our ceremony/reception.'
p1395
aS'p.s. My dress was ordered online because most boutiques in OC require 6 months to order. So I paid $300 for it! WHAT A STEAL!!! It costed more money to alter it! ($400). (Now that s insane if you ask me!)'
p1396
aS'My favorite detail: I wore my mother s shoes! They fit perfectly, just like Cinderella s glass slipper :) My mom s father gave them to her over 30 years ago when she left Romania to come to America with my dad and 6 of my older siblings. Wearing her shoes made me feel like I had a part of her with me at the wedding. I love the photo (included) of my two sisters helping them put on my mom s shoes. We were all pretty emotional. Nicely captured by Sammy Cosa of Closer to Love Photography.'
p1397
aS'As we were getting ready, we sent eachother a note/gift. I sent him his favorite chocolate treat that he says reminds him of when he was a small boy, when his dad would go to Germany for work and return home with a treat for him that tasted the same. He told me once when we were dating  If you love me, then buy this for me again  :)  .so I bought him 30 packs! :)) I love the picture that Sammy captured of him eating a chocolate with his dad (attached).'
p1398
aS'At our wedding, we had a special vintage table dedicated to our mothers in their honor. Even though our moms were not tangibly present, displaying two of my favorite English tea cups from my mother s collection along with a photograph of each of them was a sweet way for our guests to remember the beautiful lives each of them lived. These tea cups were also used in our engagement shoot.'
p1399
aS'Being that our wedding was in the middle of December, I wanted to keep everything winter white. My bouquet and other florals at the ceremony and reception, were made up of two of my momma s favorite flowers: peonies and tulips, along with plenty of simple yet beautiful baby s breath and other tiny white delicate wax flowers. Reception centerpieces were an eclectic mix of blown mercury glass holders, vintage bird cages, and an assortment of old books topped with beautiful little wax flowers and garden roses along with a plethora of baby s breath. (Baby s breath is one of the things that helped keep our budget down!)'
p1400
aS'During our ceremony, we decided to take communion together, as a symbol of our unity with eachother and with Christ as the center of our marriage. This was a special, emotional moment, realizing the Grace we have been given and the grace we are to extend to eachother every minute of every day, loving eachother unconditionally. I LOOOOVE the picture Sammy captured of Adrian wiping my tear. This is the perfect picture of who Adrian is: always so attentive to my every need. I AM SOOO BLESSED to be his wife!'
p1401
aS'One small detail I love from our reception was the  Zacusca  on the tables. This is a traditional Romanian appetizer spread made of eggplants, roasted peppers, onions, garlic, and other flavorful veggies, typical made in large quantities in the fall and canned to enjoy on cold winter days. It was served with warm french bread and was a huge hit, even with our non-Romanian friends. As a little girl, I remember my mom making this every fall and the smell of roasted vegetables filling up the home, so it was very special to me. These adorable jars were the perfect touch, and looked so sweet in mason jars on each table!'
p1402
aS'The wedding programs, made of simple doilies, along with the honey jar wedding favors, were DIY projects I found on Pinterest.com and were made by me! (all 320 of them!!). I ll give my husband some credit too though, since he helped me fill each of the little jars with local Organic honey. Each honey jar was covered with fabric and stamped with our monograms (stamp ordered from etsy.com) We incorporated many chalkboards at both our engagement and wedding, all of which were made by my husband and I using antique serving trays/frames and chalk paint.'
p1403
aS'People don t believe me when I tell them I planned a wedding for 316 guests in LESS THAN THREE MONTHS!! You would never know. Everything was perfect and I wouldn t change a single thing about it!'
p1404
aS'Happily Ever After really does exist. I am a living testimony :)'
p1405
aS'To keep down the budget, I did my own make up (my husband had a special request: that I  look like I always do   so I went easy on the makeup. Also, my friend who is also my hair dresser did my hair for me, half up with a simple braid and soft curls with my veil tucked under.\n'

S'M dears, get ready to feast your eyes on urban zen desert love like no other. It s organic elements turned wedding perfection, from the lettered name rocks to the watercolored rock-pattern paper goods to the air plants breathing life to the gorgeous pale viridian tablescape topped with blooms by Isari Flower Studio. There s no question that Francine Ribeau Events killed it with her cohesive design vision. Get your Pin on in the gallery from Joshua Aull Photography and Sarah Kate Photography!'
p1438
aS'From Francine Ribeau Events I (Danielle of Francine Ribeau Events) had the pleasure of planning and designing the wedding of a couple very near and dear to my heart. During their ceremony the officiant spent a little time educating all the guests on the political victories of the past year, also stating that it was probably everyone s first gay wedding. It was mine, too. He said that not only did the couple not know what to expect but neither did we. That was the truth. What is the protocol? Well, the best part of it   is there is none and we get to create it!'
p1439
aS'The amount of love, admiration and support from their guests inspired the purpose behind this shoot. We also want gay couples out there to have more outlets to find inspiration for their wedding, something a little more masculine, but still celebrating the beauty of their bond.'
p1440
aS'While the backdrop of Green Acres in San Diego is very urban and industrial, we were inspired by the multitude of colors in the rocks and in the cacti. The colors reminded us of the soft white sand and the circular patterns of a zen garden. Our goal was to take these two very different landscapes and make them work together, sort of a celebration of the unexpected.'
p1441
aS'With our color palette and vision in mind, Taryn of Twinkle and Toast created her rock-inspired invitations. The watercolor paper goods from Taryn set the scene for the ceremony backdrop we built   acrylic sheets that we spray painted to mimic the design. The design was carried throughout, as Nichole of Nic.Roc.Designs also used this pattern to laser cut coasters out of wood.'
p1442
aS'We also watercolored rocks with blues, greens, citrus yellows and lavender purples to bring our their natural colors, and used them throughout the space, as escort cards and table decor. For deserts, we stuck to the desert theme and decided to DIY some popsicles. We wanted to keep with the desert sand patterns and was able to layer various flavors to achieve the look.'
p1443
aS'Tam at Isari Floral Studio is always patient with our crazy ideas. She was eager to do a shoot with us and we thought this was a great shoot to collaborate on. Tam brought in elements of stone, glass and wood, bridging that gap between urban and zen with adding clematis and soft white flowers juxtaposed to various succulents and cactus flowers.'
p1444
aS'We were lucky enough to be set up by Tam with Joshua Aull Photography and Sarah Kate Photography   both film photographers. Natural light was the perfect complement to this shoot; Joshua and Sarah s talents gave the photos their own sense of serenity.'
p1445
aS'Looking back at the last several years and all the progress for same sex couples we have made, we feel honored and excited to be a part of building new traditions and celebrating love of any kind.\n'

S'Dressed in the brightest of colors on the sunniest of days, this wedding is what summertime bliss is truly all about. It s a day kissed by that California pretty and designed alongside the talented Intertwined Events..and those textured blooms by Floral Occasions? Don t even get me started. Ray Kang worked his photo genius behind the camera and believe it or not, the party is just getting started.'
p1488
aS'From The Bride I never pictured my dream wedding while growing up but the few things I did know were the color scheme   bright oranges, yellows and corals   and a location that had natural beauty. Thankfully, we found The Villa, a turn-of-the-century Spanish home, whose charm and elegance filled in our blank canvas quite quickly. The setting of the Villa and my love for nature inspired our invitations and decor. Every table had a distinct pair of antique brass birds, and at each place setting there was a favor of goat milk soap, handmade by the friendly Camlon Farms who we met at a farmer s market.'
p1489
aS'The warm July day was expected and thankfully our wedding coordinator, Katie Webb, suggested program fans coupled with parasols, which helped our guests avoid melting in the summer sun. The Villa staff, Michelle, Rachel and Keith, couldn t have been better and we are grateful to them for going beyond our expectations with their responsiveness, friendliness and professionalism. The food and drinks from Iva Lee s were delicious and their service was fantastic. Floral Occasions  vivid arrangements punctuated the day which was captured by our favorite photographer-in-a-bow tie, Ray Kang, and film crew, 4120 Productions. Our hope is that our kids will enjoy looking at these memories as much as we enjoyed seeing our parents  and grandparents  wedding days. All of this was icing on the three-tiered Swiss made cake provided by Sweet Art   heavenly for both our eyes and tastebuds.'
p1490
aS'For the ceremony, we borrowed and adapted a tradition from the Jewish faith called the Seven Blessings, which turned out to be a highlight of the day. Seven guests, chosen by us, gave their thoughts on a specific word (passion, playfulness, gratitude, etc.) that would help lead to a happy marriage. Not only was it deeply satisfying to hear these blessings, but it finally gave us the privilege to take in the ceremony, as all eyes were on our speakers and not on us.'
p1491
aS'In the end, all of these details added up to a wedding we couldn t have possibly imagined but was exactly what we wanted   intimate, heartfelt and fun.\n'

aS'The next day, we both attended a meeting for the University s Leadership Program. I recognized Nick from the day before and reintroduced myself. Nick said a quick hello before rushing off for another appointment.'
p1537
aS'Finally, I guess 3rd times a charm, Monday morning, 9 AM, very first class of college, I walk in and there is Nick. He waved me over and asked if I wanted to sit with him. I guess the rest is history. We have been together over 11 years!'
p1538
aS'It was very important for us to try to have our wedding all outdoors. My parents had their wedding barefoot in a local park and I wanted to try to incorporate elements of that into our wedding. Nick s family has a farm in a neighboring town and when my parent s came to town to help us venue hunt, Nick s mom suggested we check out this local park. She had been by once before and thought it was beautiful. When we all walked through the gates and saw those gorgeous HUGE trees, we knew Empire Mine was the perfect spot!'
p1539
aS'Trying to plan a wedding at a state park is not the easiest thing to do especially when we had to do it all long distance. There were a lot of rules to follow and logistics to incorporate into the plans. Because of this, I chose to hire as many local vendors as I could, using recommendations from the state park rangers. Most of our vendors were all familiar with the park rules, the park set-up, and already had great relationships with the park rangers. We were also excited to help support the local community. It was the best decision and despite all the rules, our wedding execution was seamless!'
p1540
aS'For other vendors, including our photographer, florist, and even dress alterations, I found most of them through friends, for example, I discovered Mirelle Carmichael, our photographer, because she was the cousin of a friend of mine and I found our popsicle vendor from Off The Grid, a food truck gathering in San Francisco.'
p1541
aS'The theme of our wedding was good friends, good food, and good fun! We wanted to enjoy the process of planning the wedding as much as the actual wedding so tried to keep it casual! I would say our style was garden party, I tried to envision the best garden party and incorporate aspects of those details into the wedding. I have always loved the colors sky blue and lemon yellow. I knew I wanted them together but didn t want the colors to fight for attention, so I used blue as my main color and incorporated pops of yellow into my bouquet, my shoes, boutonnieres and on other subtle details.'
p1542
aS'I don t really know why but I don t love wedding cake so I tried to do-away with the wedding cake idea, however, my mom insisted that it was cruel to wedding guests (and to her) to not have a wedding cake so we compromised she could have wedding cake if I could have popsicles, my favorite dessert.'
p1543
aS'I tried to be conscious of not being wasteful. I picked the few pieces I needed and tried to do away with anything extraneous, including programs, menus, table cards, and sent electronic save-the-dates (only printing a few for family). I tried to gather all the little details secondhand or by borrowing from friends.'
p1544
aS'I incorporated lots of little details that had special meaning to me. I stored all my jewelry for the wedding in a box my grandmother, who passed away, had made for me when I was little, I pinned the cameo I was handed down from a family friend on my bouquet and for all the decorations, I just tried to stay on theme and true to Nick and my personality did it represent good friends, was it family-oriented, and was it fun?! If the answer was yes, it was a go!'
p1545
aS'One of my favorite memories was walking onto the grounds and seeing the final touches coming together for both the ceremony and reception site and seeing all our hard work and ideas finally come to life. A lot of people worked really hard to make it all happen and it was so special to see how great it all ended up. As they say, this wedding took a village!'
p1546
aS'During the reception, it was about 9:30pm, the cake had been cut and all that was left was to dance until we dropped. All of a sudden I started to see a couple guests running around with carnivale-style masks on I remember thinking,  how fun, someone brought masks to the wedding!  But then pretty soon more and more guests had them until almost everyone was wearing them except for Nick and I. My parents came up to Nick and I with special masks and shouted,  It s Cotillion, let s celebrate!  My parents who had been living in Santiago, Chile throughout the wedding planning process had brought back masks for all our guests to celebrate our wedding   carnival style! It was such a cool surprise and was a huge hit with our guests!'
p1547
aS'This wedding wasn t just Nick and I, it was a whole group of people who helped along the way. The other piece of advice that helped me a lot was,  When you look back at your photos you want to be able to recognize yourself and your groom in them. Your wedding should be an expression of yourselves and your relationships. Not a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play dress up for the day.  I took that advice to heart and tried to ensure that everything we included felt like something we would want on any other day.'
p1548
aS'The biggest advice I can give to grooms is if your bride needs your advice, the answer  it s your wedding, you decide  or  I don t care  is never the right answer! Decide ahead of time a few things you want to have an opinion on and then offer it when the time comes. Brides are making a lot of decisions and sometimes it gets stressful and overwhelming. It was so helpful to have Nick act as my partner in crime so when I got stuck on a detail I could say do you like this or that and he would give me a straight answer.'
p1549
aS'Don t JUST use Pinterest! It can be like a hole that sucks you in and never lets you go. Find a few things you really like and then print it out. I liked to say I pinterested in real life, but really I just got so overwhelmed with all the options, I spent one night with all the magazines and print-outs and created a collage for each section of the wedding: ceremony, reception, flowers, etc. and then used that as my mood board. It helped my vendors get some perspective on what we wanted and gave me a good stopping point.'

aS'A guess at the end of the day, it helps to remember, a wedding is just ONE day in your life and it is the START of your life with your husband and becoming part of each other s families. Keep it in perspective when you re in the planning process. Make sure that what you come away with, when all the cake has been eaten and the guests have left, is happy memories and a new bond with your family and friends.\n'

S'From the bride s Ines Di Santo gown to the  maids  sparkly frocks, this wedding is a day centered on style. Bright Blue Events designed the gorgeous details, and I, for one, can t get enough. It may be blistering cold in our part of New England, but I m feeling pretty good about settling in for the night with Gina & Ryan s photos and soaking up every last inch.'
p1621
aS'From Gina & Ryan Photography We ve been in love with Calamigos Ranch ever since we first stumbled upon it while planning our own wedding. The grounds of this Malibu ranch are gorgeous. Twinkle lights, large oak trees, pretty signage, and subtle quirks of a vintage carnival theme are sprinkled throughout the property, making this place truly unique. Even the architectural design is of it s own. It s a dream. And although we weren t able to have a Calamigos Ranch wedding ourselves (tip, book your date way in advance!), we were able to relive the romance through Megan & Stanley s breathtaking wedding.'
p1622
aS'Megan & Stanley s vision was aimed towards simplicity, clean graphic design, and a whole lot of pretty; upscale rustic chic. The two put together an elite team of wedding specialists who brought their vision to life. Every little detail was executed to a  T , making for an absolutely unforgettable day. Megan & Stanley s Calamigos Ranch wedding took place at The Cottage Pavilion. They tied the knot under a large twinkle-lit oak tree, beneath the warm ambiance of the chandelier above. It couldn t have been any more romantic! And the reception? Whoa, yeah, that pretty! Large dark wood tables were canvased with pretty white hydrangeas along with an eclectic mix of glass and crystal dinnerware, silver candle holders, and baby succulent wedding favors jarred in glass pots.'
p1623
aS'The wedding day unfolded with ease. Megan was absolutely stunning, calm and collected. And Stanley was as handsome and as excited as ever. The two (without a doubt) are a couple of the most rad people we ve worked with. They radiate happiness, kindness, and a whole lot of fun. Genuinely happy, the type you can hang out all day with and still want more.\n'

aS'From the beautiful Bride David and I wanted our wedding to be full of all our favorite things: family, friends, fun, and warm summer nights under the stars. We wanted our wedding day to be a celebration of not only our marriage, but also a celebration of all the special people in our lives. We wanted to create an atmosphere where people could kick back, relax, and enjoy all that we had prepared for them.'
p1674
aS'We could not have found a better wedding venue! Coyote Ranch in Morgan Hill, California was the perfect place to fulfill all of our wedding dreams. We exchanged vows near a backdrop of trees, (another one of our favorite things!), and were surrounded by an amazing bridal party composed of family and childhood friends. During the cocktail hour, our guests had the opportunity to play some homemade, classic lawn games, some of which included a ring toss and a giant jenga. Guests were also treated to a classic barbecue buffet, freshly popped popcorn, s mores to roast over an open fire, a colorful dessert table, and live music throughout the night.'
p1675
aS'David and I were also so pleased with all of the vendors we chose for our wedding! Our wedding coordinator, Lara, (owner of Sealed With a Kiss Events), went above and beyond our expectations. She helped keep us calm and organized and truly understood our vision for our special day. Huckleberry Karen Designs also helped enhance the playful atmosphere of our wedding with unique floral arrangements, which included a variety of textures and colors. They even managed to fit in two more of our favorite things   succulents and feathers! Our photographer, Jasmine Lee, and her assistant Tyler, captured each and every moment flawlessly. They made David and I feel comfortable behind the camera, and truly captured the joy of our wedding. Our band,  The Lucky Devils,  perfectly emulated our hopes for the night s music. People of all ages raved that the music was the  cherry on top  to our reception.'
p1676
aS'The countless hours we spent planning, designing, and building each DIY touch paid off in the end. Our wedding was exactly what we had dreamed of and more! Our wedding was a perfect, warm summer night under the stars, surrounded by the ones we love.\n'

We combined what we both loved   for Michael, the outdoors, dark wooden and rustic accents and, for me, white flowers, romantic lighting and chandeliers. Michael is from England so there were hints of his hometown as well in certain areas of our wedding   Beatles music as we walked down the aisle, English gardens and, of course, tea for all the guests.\n'

Make your way to the gallery for even more.'
p1789
aS'From Aga Jones Photography I was honored to be part of this beautiful Jewish wedding day. Stunning private estate in Bonsall couldn t be more perfect for this day. Every details, flowers by Third Bloom and coordination by ladies from Tres Chic Affairs, it was perfect wedding to start Summer season.'
p1790
aS'From the beautiful Bride My husband and I had a clear idea of what kind of wedding we wanted: romantic, fun, intimate and personal. With some luck and hard work, we got just that. My parents own a home north of San Diego on several acres filled with citrus trees, avocado trees and a small vineyard. San Diego in June is pretty much paradise, so it was an easy choice to have our wedding at my parent s house. My parents spent months creating an event space that captured the mood we were trying to create.'
p1791
aS'We are lucky to have many helpful, talented people in our lives who helped to put personal, beautiful accents on the day. My stepdad made the chuppah where we were married, as well as the beautiful tables where we dined. My mom spent months sourcing vintage silverware for dinner and wine barrels to use as belly bars. My mother-in-law, a party planner, helped with fun details like the candy bar and flip flops for dancing. Our friend Diallo Riddle DJed and killed it. Another dear friend played the music during the wedding processional, and my brothers read poems during the ceremony.'
p1792
aS'During our cocktail hour, we focused on fun. We had a local bluegrass band from San Diego, yard games and a candy machine filled with Hershey s kisses. After dinner, as some of the guests left and more and more of our friends hit the dance floor, we upped the music, broke out a pi ata filled with candy and had late-night tacos. Being at my parent s house, we were able to turn the reception into its own after-party.'
p1793
aS'Our best decisions   after deciding to get married in the first place   were picking our vendors. Our photographer, Aga Jones, was sensational. Her photographs of the day are stunning and perfectly captured the look and mood that we wanted. As an added bonus, she was forceful enough to wrangle my large family and a boisterous group of groomsmen. Flowers from Third Bloom were perfection, from my bridal bouquet to the centerpieces. Our  day of  coordinator, Molly Stark at Tres Chic Affairs, made sure all of hard work we put in over the last year paid off and everything ran smoothly. One of the best investments we made was having a videographer. I initially resisted hiring one, but it was important to my husband. He was right! I cannot wait to get the footage of the day since it went by so fast.'
p1794
aS'As an admitted  Type A  person, I tried to plan every tiny detail of the day, but two of my favorite things were complete surprises. My husband s nickname for me is Panda, and he worked with our florist to create a special panda boutonni re. It was an adorable, special touch. Also, our best man and maid of honor put together a video of well wishes from wedding guests and those who were unable to attend. It reminded us how lucky we are to have such wonderful people in our lives.'
p1795
aS'My husband and I were both overwhelmed with love and gratitude at our wedding. It meant the world to us to have our family and closest friends together to celebrate our love for and commitment to each other.\n'

Mirelle Carmichael captured every moment and your Tuesday just got a whole better with this stunning gallery.'
p1836
aS'From the Bride  My husband Gianni and I met in Calculus class while attending Cal Poly SLO. After graduating, we migrated up the coast to San Francisco and began working closely together at a small start up. After a decade, we knew that we would always be together, but it was only after a garage accident and ER difficulty that we decided to legalize our union. San Luis Obispo was where we cultivated the foundation of our relationship and we couldn t wait to return for a celebration!'
p1837
aS'The one thing we repetitively heard from married friends was that the day would be a blur. Overcoming that challenge was our biggest focus during the planning process. We wanted an intimate wedding that would maximize quality time with family and friends. Our first decision was to ditch the single wedding day and instead host a three-day party. We found Flying Caballos Ranch (FCR) through Central Coast Wedding Standard (CCWS) and it was perfect because it could accommodate a ceremony, a reception and lodging for 25 VIPs! Our second highest priority was capturing everything we would potentially miss by sourcing a keen-eyed photo journalist. We were fortunate enough to find Mirelle Carmichael Photography (also through CCWS) and she graciously referred us to the other amazing small business vendors we hired. Each vendor lent extraordinary expertise, but always took great care in executing our vision first.'
p1838
aS'We opted to create an atmosphere that was minimalistic, modern and full of texture, highlighting a centralized metal theme   an ode to my husband s hobby garage work. Our wedding colors were a neutral palette of champagne and varying light to dark grey tones. We kicked off our theme with miniature letter-pressed Save the Dates and engraved stainless steel formal invitations that I created. Next, we set out to find wedding attire that especially mirrored our aesthetic. My handmade Monique Lhuillier gown (the first dress I tried on) featured an extremely modern, but delicately folded, crumb-catcher bust with a stark contrast of disorganized, silk organza strips fluttering from my waist down to the ground. I wore no jewelry except handcrafted solid sterling silver octopus tentacle earrings   custom made for me by a friend   and my shoes were plain grey suede pumps. My husband s light grey Burberry suit was expertly tailored in SF with a custom made lavender shirt (to match his mother s dress) and an Italian wool pinstripe tie. He wore USA-made Wolverine high top boots, the Archimedes pilot watch my parents gave him as a wedding present and his favorite gentleman s folding knife. He radiated the likes of European Mad Men.'
p1839
aS'For the reception, we had simple centerpieces made from unstained wooden boxes filled with moss and votive candles with steel stencils for table numbers. Since we wanted guests to have their own set of reusable memorabilia, each seat had a petite wooden clipboard menu, a hand stamped aluminum washer with their name to act as a seating card and a single serving of Bulleit bourbon in a glass corked bottle. Italian cafe lights glittered over the dinner tables and our handmade DONATI marquee illuminated the background of the dance floor. I am privileged to be married to a renaissance man who is an incredible builder of  well, anything. All of our wedding decorations were hand made by him, including our Titanium wedding bands the zebra wood and Horween leather ring box that carried them.'
p1840
aS'My favorite part of our wedding was the feeling of calmness I had when I awoke next to my future husband. We spent time that morning watching the sunrise, quietly holding hands, practicing our first dance and revising our vows. My second favorite part of the day was listening to him recite those vows. While my best friend spoke, the world around me was silenced and his resolve resonated through each word. That single feeling will carry my heart for an eternity.\n'

S'Any bride who can rock a Monique Lhuillier gown paired with a full-length cape is a style rockstar, in my book. And along with her Claire Pettibone crown and Jimmy Choo shoes, this fashionista did just that. Soleil Events helped bring the couple s vision for a relaxed, Tuscan-inspired party to fruition and our friends at Rad + In Love worked their talents behind the camera. More right here.'
p1904
aS'From the Wedding Planner, Leanne Elliott From the first conversation with Kit and Alejandro I knew this wedding was going to be memorable. They had their priorities in order: 1) A great party, 2) A great party. It is so refreshing to have an engaged couple think of their wedding experience from the stand point of being attentive hosts. Kit and Alejandro envisioned a weekend of festivities, where nearly 200 guests would be treated to something truly special that reflects the couples love for each and every person. The Villa at Sunstone Winery was the perfect choice. With Kit s Jersey Girl meets Bohemian LA sensibilities, and Alejandro s Uruguayan good looks and preppy style, the Villa provided just the old-world WOW factor they had hoped to find.'
p1905
aS'The family took up residency at the Villa on Friday, and the weekend was kicked off with a traditional Argentine Asado Welcome Dinner on the Villa s back lawn. On the wedding day, the property was transformed into a simple, elegant setting that was plucked right off the pages of a Tuscany wedding feast. The ceremony took place under the property s enormous White Oak. Kit stunned in a Monique Lhuillier dress with a full-length lace cape, while the Gents dazzled in J. Crew suits with tailored perfection. The reception, catered by the impeccable Lorraine Lim Catering, was a fuss-free party where the family-style dinner took center stage. Floral by Anna Le Pley Taylor brought in a vibrant, Bohemian vibe that popped against the cotton linens and gorgeous stone fa ade of the Villa. The property glowed as the sun set over Santa Ynez wine country, and DJ Smiles Davis from Flashdance spun tunes from the 80s Jersey Shore, to LA s hottest clubs.'
p1906
aS'From The Bride  My dress and cape were both from Monique Lhuillier. They told me that no one else had ever bought the cape, which I think is a travesty. My shoes were Jimmy Choo and my metal crown was from Claire Pettibone. Alejandro s suit was custom from Requisite Clothing. And his shoes were Barker Black.'
p1907
aS'My bridesmaids were my six best friends from high school in South Jersey and all flew out from the East Coast. They were in J.crew. Al had family and friends fly in all the way from Uruguay. My good friend/senior prom date, Chris Lind played Tom Waits   Jersey Girl  as we walked down the aisle and Fleetwood Mac s  Tusk  when we walked out. Our first dance was to  Fading Like a Flower  by Roxette. They were the first concert Al ever went to at the soccer stadium in Uruguay (at the same time I was wearing the cassette tape out in my moms car in South Jersey). We got to see them in la a couple of years ago and sang along to every song. My dad and I danced to  Edelweiss  from The Sound of Music, which he used to sing to me when i was a little girl. Al and his mom danced to La Punalada, a tango from Uruguay. And my dad sang Al and I a version of a song he wrote and sang to my mom at their wedding in 1968.'

S'I can t decide if it s the girly girl within me, or that the color is just simply always gorgeous, but either way, I never get sick of blush. It makes my heart flutter and combined with these dark tabletops and white roses, this wedding is picture perfect. Weddings By Sasha captured it all, and Reel Eyes Media made sure to bring the romance. Join me as I swoon over every beautiful detail right here.'
p1953
aS'From Shannon Leahy Events  Leslie and Paul were one of the most in love and kindest couples I have ever had the pleasure of working with. They met at a friends Super Bowl party and after years of bachelorhood in San Francisco, Paul instantly knew that she was the one. He loved her family values, her fun-loving personality and of course, was struck by her beauty. Not too long after their courtship began, Paul proposed to Leslie at their favorite Napa getaway, Meadowood and they decided to get married there the following Fall.'
p1954
aS'Leslie is a girly girl at heart so we had to use white and blush roses, lots of lace and sweeping, romantic decor. We brought in the rustic Napa Valley and Paul s masculine side with lots of touches of dark wood. The ceremony on the golf course was absolutely lovely, framed by their large bridal party of friends and family.'
p1955
aS'One of my favorite details for this wedding arose out of finding a solution for keeping guests out of the dinner space. Since the cocktail hour and dinner lawn were connected but we didn t want guests to enter until it was time, we hedged off the space and created a grand entry with a simple sign  Good things come to those who wait.  The purpose, of course, was to urge guests to wait until dinner, but it also served as a beautiful reminder of Paul and Leslie s love that they both waited for many years.'
p1956
aS'Individual roses on each place setting mirrored the rose wine served at dinner. A macaroon station and cake from Perfect Endings for dessert and a sparkler exit made for a gorgeous evening in the Napa Valley.\n'

S'Last month, we sat down with the charming and talented David of David Pressman Events and we got a little glimpse into how he dreams up all the pretty. And today m dears, we ve got the proof in the pictures by Next Exit Photography. This fun-loving couple is just the duo we envisioned David gravitating toward and vice versa. Their eclectically styled, full-of-color soiree set at Saddlerock Ranch is emitting the happiest vibes see it all here.'

aS'From the beautiful Bride Justin and I met at summer camp in Northern Ontario, Canada when we were teenagers. It was puppy love! We dated for a summer and it was very special. But, after that summer was over, he went back to California and we went on with our lives in separate countries (I grew up in Canada). Over the years, we stayed in touch and we both had a strong feeling that we would somehow end up together, eventually!'
p2004
aS'The proposal was very romantic. On a visit back to Canada, we took a day trip up to the town near our old summer camp. Justin took a detour and surprised my by bringing me to our old summer camp. When we got to the basketball courts, where we first met as teenagers, he got on one knee and asked me to marry him!'
p2005
aS'We both knew absolutely that we wanted to get married outdoors. When we pulled up to the Chateau Dome at Saddlerock Ranch, the view took our breath away and we just knew that it was our spot. For our wedding, my family was visiting from Canada, and it was such a treat to be totally surrounded by the California landscape with 360 views of a vineyard, a whimsical little farm with some zebras, and the gorgeous Malibu mountains.'
p2006
aS'The inspiration was a rustic, colorful, warm and intimate California celebration. We love color and couldn t decide on just a couple colors as a theme, so we decided to make the wedding as colorful as possible   the colored vintage glass vases and multicolored flowers set a romantic tone. We wanted the banquet tables to be overflowing with lush flowers, to show off all the gorgeous blooms available in springtime in California, so we let our wedding designer/planner, David Pressman and the incredible florist he introduced us to, Krista Jon, run wild with colorful blooms to create a flower paradise! It was heaven!'
p2007
aS'When we were signing our Ketubah, our Rabbi spontaneously starting to sing  Going to the chuppah and we re gonna get married  (to the tune of Going to the Chapel of Love). It was such a happy moment; we all joined in and sang together. I will always think of our wedding when I hear that song!'
p2008
aS'Our kiss at the ceremony is a vivid memory   it was a fantastic, electrifying kiss! When I looked at Justin, he had my red lipstick on his teeth, a funny and cute moment I will never forget. Also, our first dance to Van Morrison s  Into the Mystic.  During the first dance, it was the first time that I had the chance to slow down at the wedding and feel all the emotions. Justin and I were so connected and I felt overwhelmed with happiness.'

p2049
aS'From The Bride Our friends and family were dispersed across the country, and our new home of Chicago couldn t be counted on to cooperate for a July outdoors wedding. In considering destinations, we settled on picturesque Northern California. Not only would we be surrounded by natural beauty, but Morgan had spent her childhood in nearby Santa Rosa and has fond memories of days spent enjoying the outdoors there.'
p2050
aS'We knew we wanted two things at the reception   great food and a fun party that wouldn t be shut down at 10:00 pm. We were drawn to Farmstead because of their fantastic cuisine, especially their ribs, which we ended up having cooked over an open fire for the wedding. We could enjoy dinner outside under twinkling bistro lights plus take advantage of a perfectly sized indoor space that let us dance well into the morning.'
p2051
aS'We wanted a more intimate setting for the ceremony, closer to nature and away from the  hustle and bustle  of St. Helena. After much research, we came across the beautiful Rust Ridge Ranch, a horse ranch and winery in the mountains. The venue houses a lovely bed and breakfast, allowing our closest friends to stay on site with us, maximizing time amongst far-flung guests. While remote (no need to warn guests to turn off their cell phones), the idyllic setting was a perfect match for our vision of the ceremony.'
p2052
aS'We asked our friend Tom to officiate, whom we met in DC the same night we met each other   introduced by our future maid of honor and best man. Guests kept (somewhat) cool by picturesque parasols while a fiddle-cello duet played folk songs and bluegrass in the background. The stumps lining the aisle came from the Rust Ridge property. The overall design of the events emphasized an organic and rustic aesthetic, focused more on the beautiful surroundings than on a overly-styled theme. It was a truly magical day in our lives spent with people we love.\n'

S'This darling Bride right here? She s making us blush. Not only because she s absolutely stunning, but her sweet words about how SMP was such a source of inspiration throughout the planning process? Well, it makes our hearts burst with a thankful kind of love. Not to mention, all the pretty that was made possible by the rockstar team of vendors. onelove photography snapped it all up, as they so beautifully do every time, and we can t get enough.'
p2119
aS'From the beautiful Bride Since Bryan and I met as children, fell in love at sixteen, and remained together ever since, we wanted our wedding to be a celebration not just of our love story, but also of the people who had invested in us through every season, and of the faith that had taught us how beautiful and good love could be.'
p2120
aS'We wanted the evening to be dreamy, warm, and joyful   our whimsical twist on a classic fairytale. After searching for venues throughout Los Angeles, we selected the Langham Huntington Hotel in Pasadena, the city we both grew up in. It was the perfect fit for our vision of timelessness with a dash of glamour. The gorgeous ballroom, with its blush decor, gold accents, and crystal chandeliers captured our colors perfectly. Our ceremony was held at San Marino Community Church, where my parents married twenty-eight years prior.'
p2121
aS'Honoring each of our lineages was a priority to us: many details of our day told stories of where our families had been and pointed to where we hoped to go as a new family. We took elements of Bryan s family coat of arms and images from my family s Armenian heritage to create our own crest, adding details that marked meaningful elements of our love story, most significantly a verse from Scripture. My bouquet included a piece of my mother s wedding veil and a cameo brooch from my grandmother s engagement season, and one of my favorite details of our day were the scalloped lace napkin treatments on each guest s place setting, topped with a cameo to echo this treasured piece of jewelry of my grandmother s. To tie in with the gorgeous antique china in the reception foyer, we displayed our parents  and grandparents  china, and we incorporated our family s silver pieces throughout the d cor.'
p2122
aS'It was a priority to us to communicate that we cherish every person who celebrated with us, and that we wouldn t have our love story without the influence of theirs! When we started planning, one of my first dreams for our day was honoring all of the marriages in our lives by creating a display of all our guests  wedding photos. Throughout our engagement, my mom, sister, and mother-in-law worked tirelessly to collect over 100 frames   a mix of big, small, new, and vintage   and the final product was beautiful! To emphasize that we intend to continue doing life with our guests far beyond our wedding day, in lieu of a guestbook we asked guests to write us letters to be read when we reach major life milestones. Guests penned sweet notes that we ll open many years from now.'
p2123
aS'As part of our ceremony, we also took a new spin on an old wedding tradition: two close friends whose marriage we had recently celebrated were our  something new,  our grandparents who have each been married for over fifty years were our  something old,  and a pair of our close friends from college were our  something blue.  We also chose to be given away to one another by both sets of parents, as a way for us to acknowledge all that each of our families had done to love us as individuals and support us in our relationship.'
p2124
aS'Our cakes were absolutely spectacular, designed and created by one of my bridesmaids  very talented mother. Our two flavors were hazelnut and rose   unconventional and so delicious   and I especially loved that one of our cakes featured our new married monogram for the very first time!'
p2125
aS'I had been noting small details for quite some time that I knew I d want included in our wedding, but scouring Style Me Pretty and brainstorming with our fabulous vendors were the best ways to find ideas throughout wedding planning. From personalizing our signature drinks with names of our long-loved hobbies (Bagpiper & Ballerina) to foregoing individual place cards for one large menu displayed on a large vintage mirror, Style Me Pretty was a treasure trove of inspiration!'
p2126
aS'I can t emphasize enough how important it is to pick vendors who are not only exceptional at what they do but also wonderful people. They are so much a part of your engagement season and wedding day! Our planner, Deanna Tat, turned all the wild dreams I had for our day into a reality, and she did so with such enthusiasm and warmth. When our wedding day came, I could hardly believe how seamlessly she had woven every detail together! She was phenomenal! We were similarly thrilled to have Onelove as our photographer   we had a specific vision for our photos and also wanted someone who would be a beam of light on our day and know how to spot all those tender, candid moments. Sara was all that and so much more! From your floral designer to your hair and makeup artists, pick people who are sold out to how uniquely special your day is to you and your partner, because those are the people whose work is driven by passion and I promise that makes all the difference!'
p2127
aS'Amidst flurried guest-list editing, seemingly endless rounds of envelope-stuffing, and late-night Internet searching for that perfect vintage side table, know that your wedding day will be beautiful and your marriage even more so. As tempting as it is to seek perfection, remain gracious with yourself as you discover you just can t do everything, and be bold in bringing your distinctive touch into your planning. Remember that ultimately, it s your love that makes you radiant.'
p2128
aS'It was so special to spend the morning and afternoon with some of the most important women in my life. From my stunning momma to my gorgeous-in-every-way maid of honor and bridesmaids, they reminded me on my wedding day as they do every day what selflessness and beauty look like! We had such fun lounging around in our shortie sets, and our final champagne toast and prayer before we left for the church was the best way I could have imagined to make that leap from Miss to Mrs.'
p2129
aS'Bryan and I loved saying our vows to one another and then praying with our pastors as three of our groomsmen performed a beautiful song in our ceremony. After over eight years of dating, it was such a powerful experience to commit ourselves to one another, come what may, for the rest of our lives.'
p2130
aS'Our band was a unanimous favorite, and we thought we might explode with joy during our first dance to  Beyond the Sea,  a song from one of the first movies we watched together as teenagers, and then dancing through midnight surrounded by cheering friends and family. Even our grandmothers, who we share special relationships with, got out on the dance floor with us! It was pure bliss to find ourselves amidst that much love and watch all the people we care about celebrating and partying together!\n'

S'What happens when two Grooms set out to host a whimsical fiesta wedding day? Crazy good things   just you wait and see. With the talented ladies of Beau & Arrow Events by their side, they pulled off an event elevated with design surprises, from gold foil invites to handmade tile escort cards, and every detail in between. See more from Honey Honey Photography and the The Yodsukars  film below!'
p2194
aS'From The Couple In Spanish, the word  milagro  means miracle or wonder. We chose the milagro, a folk charm in Mexico, Latin American, and the Iberian Peninsula, as one of the stylistic elements for our wedding because of its symbolic meaning it connotes wonder, healing, and surprise. These were the recurring themes of our special day. One of our vows, in fact, was a promise to  laugh, restore, and surprise.  Because wonder and surprise are so central to our relationship, we wanted elements of surprise throughout the day, and boy did we accomplish it with the help of some amazing people!'
p2195
aS'We wanted a whimsical fiesta feel for our La Jolla wedding (neither of us hails from Mexico, but that didn t stop us!), and the fabulous ladies at Beau & Arrow Events totally ran with it (more on this amazing duo in a bit). They put us in touch with Odd Daughter Paper Co., who did a bang-up job turning the festive whimsy feel we were going for into gorgeous, unique invitations. We knew we wanted hand lettering and an invitation that invitees could cherish, so our stationer s suggestion that we go with a gold foil technique was perfect! We had certainly never seen a gold foil papel picado design. When our invitees opened the invitations, they felt like they were opening a golden ticket. This was exactly the wonder and surprise we wanted our guests to experience from our very first communication.'
p2196
aS'The second surprise we wanted guests to experience upon arrival was the already breathtaking Darlington House in La Jolla decorated in an elevated Mexican style. In preparation for the wedding, we took a trip across the border to Tijuana to source colorful sombreros, decorative tiles, papel picado, milagros, and other fiesta-related decorations for the big day. (Our story of walking back to the U.S. with eleven sequined sombreros and multiple garbage bags full of other fabulousness is one for another day and another blog.) The girls at Beau and Arrow incorporated these elements into a remarkable, elevated, colorful, and earthy Mexican-inspired design. A few of our favorite design elements: The inspired milagro escort display. Kate and Ellen at B&A personally hand made each tile so guests could take home a unique work of art. The striking dessert display of delicious pies by Elizabethan against colorful sombrero backdrop? Genius!'
p2197
aS'These ladies at Root 75 took some of our favorite flowers dahlias, zinnias, proteas, and succulents to level of beauty and whimsy that we never thought was possible. There are so many beautiful details that B&A and our vendors executed flawlessly; our guests were stunned, as were we.'
p2198
aS'The ceremony was certainly an unconventional one. Each of us had both parents walk us down the aisle. We thought it was important to make a statement, both that this would not be a traditional wedding and that we had the support of our entire families. Our little ni os carried signs reading  Love Equals Love  to lead the procession with a statement of the universality of love. We felt this was important for those of our guests who had never been to a wedding in which both of the participants happen to be men.'
p2199
aS'Very early in the ceremony, we completely surprised guests with a dramatic reading of a poem that spoke to us. Our amazing officiant acted as if she was about to recite a poem, and suddenly our theatre friends pop out from various locations around the ceremony courtyard, each performing a stanza for our audience. This set the tone of wonder and surprise for our guests that continued throughout the night.'
p2200
aS'We also invented new traditions that night. Didn t think that two men would do a garter toss? Think again! We surprised our guests with a sock garter toss! We also invented a musical send-off where guests gathered around a grand piano inside the house for a couple of songs. Jason sang a surprise duet with Aaron s friend, Laura Bohn, who is a professional soprano. Then Jason and Aaron sang a duet of My Funny Valentine as a musical farewell to guests.'
p2201
aS'However, the most surprising aspect of the wedding was Aaron s remarkable father-son dance, that occurred just when guests thought all of the surprises were over. You have to check out the video to believe it. Backstory: During the planning process, when we were brainstorming ideas, Aaron professed his love for Bollywood dance. Jason said in no uncertain terms: no. Aaron insisted. Jason said no. Aaron gave up. Or did he? During Aaron s father-son dance, a troupe of Bollywood dancers emerged to the amazement of our guests   and to the astonishment of Jason, who never saw it coming. It was a jaw-dropping sight that we don t think any of our guests will ever forget.'
p2202
aS'We can t say enough positive things about all of the people who worked tirelessly to make this day of wonder happen so seamlessly. Everyone seriously needs to know how remarkable the ladies at Beau and Arrow Events are. This was the best investment we could ever have made in our wedding. B&A connected us with incredible vendors. From our florist to our photographer Honey Honey, who made us feel relaxed and captured our essences perfectly. Our videographers, The Yodsukars. (We dare you not to get the chills when you watch the highlight video.) Every detail of our big day was both flawlessly executed and a wonderful surprise to our guests and to us.\n'

S'When a Michael & Anna Costa wedding lands on my desk, I know it s going to be a good day. They re magnets for pretty soirees and totally in love couples, it s true. And when they team up with a group of vendors like the lovelies listed below, it comes as no surprise that we re left with a gallery as swoon-worthy as this one. It s all right here, waiting to be perused!'
p2275
aS'From the beautiful Bride Matt and I met outside a Coldstone Creamery in the fall of 2007, during an informal get-together before we started law school. (That Coldstone is now closed, but luckily, we re not superstitious about chain ice cream stores.) We were in the same small group of 16 kids who had all our classes together for our first semester. We lived on the same block and became close friends right away. For various reasons, it took about two years for us to finally get together, and when we did, it was only with the help of two of our best friends, both of whom were in our wedding party.'
p2276
aS'Matt grew up in Santa Barbara, and I grew up in Los Angeles, so after we graduated, it made sense for us to move back to L.A. We both took the bar and are practicing attorneys, though Matt practices much more than I do. He works in-house, and I temp, but I m mainly a novelist (I ve written two detective novels, Follow Her Home and Beware Beware, both published by St. Martin s Minotaur). We live with our basset hound, Duke, who is the droopy, lazy light of our lives.'
p2277
aS'He was not, unfortunately, involved in our wedding, though he did come in for some pictures, and we prevailed on our baker and wedding planner to allow us to display a basset hound cake topper not on top of the cake, but in a tasteful cloche next to it. We got married at the Four Seasons Biltmore in Santa Barbara, a nice walk from his childhood home. Our first date was actually right by the hotel, eating In-N-Out on the sea wall. My first visit to the hotel where I d be married was to use the lobby bathroom during that date.\n'

S'This wedding has officially pushed the envelope of pretty. Crafted from the heart and perfectly planned by Weddings By RedLight, this quirky yet elegant affair at The Fig House is the definition of fun. From the bridesmaids  bright heels to the florals in the Bride s hair, every detail captured by Mark Brooke Photography is pure gallery perfection and has stolen my heart.'
p2313
aS'From Mark Brooke Photographers Meagan and Martin mixed tradition and color to their wedding day. They where married in their beautiful church surrounded by friends and family. Following was their Reception at the new LA venue, the Fig House, where color, details, and Art exploded from every inch of the space.'
p2314
aS'They wanted the opposite of stuffy. The reception felt like a big family party. Everyone knew everyone and the live band brought everyone to their feet for a night of dancing and celebrating. Between the art on the walls, the dessert table that had 7 different cakes, the vibrant colors, and comfy couches, Megan and Martins wedding was one of a kind.'
p2315
aS'From The Bride Martin was a musician for a local Tahitian Dance company that Meagan danced for, and often carpooled to practices where they spent their time talking, eating, learning about each other, and falling in love. Four years later, on a vacation to Tahiti, Martin proposed to Meagan on the beach. When planning the wedding, we wanted to create an event that celebrated our love as well as our individual style. The Fig House in LA was the perfect venue that boasted a beautiful outdoor and indoor space. With over 200 guests, the space created an intimate and cozy environment for our family and friends. '

p2368
aS'From the beautiful Bride People are always surprised to hear that though we re high school sweethearts, we didn t actually go to the same high school! We first met at Irvine Chinese School, where we emceed the annual Chinese New Year Festival together. We spent several months practicing nearly every day for this event. At first, we were a little shy, and consciously avoided eye contact with each other. A few practices in, though, we decided that if we were going to be spending so much time over the next few months that we might as well get to know each other! That was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'
p2369
aS'Before we knew it, Jenn graduated from high school and went off to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). We still talked to each other every day (and at one point, got in trouble over a massive phone bill!). Michael graduated from high school two years later, and went to Dartmouth for his degree in Economics. In the two years that Jenn was in Boston and Michael was in Hanover, we made a huge effort to see each other as often as possible, busing up and down nearly every long weekend, exploring the cities, making dinner together, and playing board games with our friends late into the night.'
p2370
aS'In 2008, Jenn graduated from MIT with a degree in Neuroscience, and moved to Baltimore to get her Masters in health policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. A year later, she moved again to Washington, D.C. for an internship at the Kaiser Family Foundation, that would later become her first full-time job.'
p2371
aS'Michael graduated from Dartmouth in 2010, and was searching for a job nearly taking an offer in Seattle, but ultimately getting his dream job at the JBG Companies in D.C. After six years long-distance, we were finally together again! We spent the next three years in a almost  Friends -like situation Jenn living with her two roommates, and Michael with his two roommates just one floor down. Those three years were filled with barbecues, hosting dinner parties, exploring DC together, and sharing laughter with our friends.'
p2372
aS'At the end of 2012, we purchased a 5-story townhome in the Dupont Circle area of Washington D.C. After much persuasion, Michael managed to convince Jennifer to help him with the renovations, even though neither of us knew the first thing about renovating! This would be our first MAJOR project together, and became a very labor-intensive and long-term project. We finished renovations on the first unit at the end of April 2013, and decided to move in to the finished unit to better facilitate the renovations on the other units.'
p2373
aS'On April 28th, with the help of a friend/roommate, we moved all of our belongings from our apartment in Arlington, VA, and up four flights of stairs to our new home. By the end of the move, we were both sweaty and exhausted, but relieved and excited to be starting this new chapter! Michael suggested going up to the roof to get some air, and Jenn happily obliged.'
p2374
aS'We sat near the edge, with a wonderful view of our street. Michael started talking about our nine year journey together, and Jenn was joking around with him (because she was totally oblivious about what was happening). Very early on in our relationship, Jenn asked Michael  who she was to him  and during his  speech,  Michael described how she came to be the supportive, warm, and loving person that he loved. Jenn only started catching on when he started describing who he hoped she would be in the future and just as she began to suspect something was happening, Michael was on one knee, asking her to marry him! Jenn said something like  of COURSE I ll marry you!  and would later wish she had said something more elegant!'
p2375
aS'We were hoping for something intimate, though we knew that our guest list would end up being much bigger. So, our vision for the wedding was something less formal, not in the typical ballroom, and could feel casual, intimate, yet momentous all at the same time. We had hoped for at least part of the wedding to be outdoors and ended up choosing to do the ceremony at Crossline Community Church, and the reception outdoors at Shady Canyon Golf Club. We had toyed with the idea of using tents but ultimately, decided on string lighting. Jenn s friend showed her a picture of some lanterns, and given that we both loved the idea and the look, that was immediately incorporated into our plans.'
p2376
aS'As for colors, our immediate thought was blue and green, our two favorite colors. After much Pinterest boarding, though, Jenn suggested something truly out of character switching to navy blue and blush. Michael, surprisingly, liked this idea better, so that was that!'
p2377
aS'There were 260 guests at our wedding. Both of our families live in Shady Canyon, so there was very little question that we would be holding a part of our wedding at Shady Canyon Golf Club. The question then became, which parts do we hold at Shady Canyon? Our families felt strongly that we should get married in a church, and the food at Shady Canyon was simply amazing, and it had the casual but elegant outdoor feel that we were looking for so, we decided to hold cocktail hour and the reception at Shady Canyon!'
p2378
aS'Our parents visited a few churches for us (since we were in DC), and decided on Crossline Community Church because of the great light and high ceilings, beautiful decor, and the nearby lake. We went to visit the church when we were home for the holidays, and absolutely loved it too!'
p2379
aS'Michael chose the recessional song for the ceremony  Married Life  and the End Credits from Pixar s  Up . We also chose the ceremony songs together an assortment of piano versions of Joe Hisaishi s music from various Studio Ghibli/Hayao Miyazaki films.'
p2380
aS'The string lighting with lanterns were just amazing! Food was incredible (Osso Bucco and Sea Bass with Lobster medallions). Lots of guest and bridal party speeches all of which were incredibly touching, and (amazingly!) stayed within their time limits. Michael s brother s girlfriend made a video compilation for the couple including cameos from each of the groomsmen and bridesmaids, and several other friends.'
p2381
aS'We had instagram coasters for our guests! We had taken several pictures around Shady Canyon, and had instagrammed them over the years; we picked four of our favorites, headed over to Zazzle, and made them into a set of coasters!'
p2382
aS'We were initially going to go to Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand for our honeymoon though the military coup forced us to swap out Thailand for Vietnam instead. Then, there were protests going on Vietnam so we ended up just doing two weeks in Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka) and Taiwan (Taipei and Taitung). We are also going on a second trip to Paris and India (New Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur) though the India portion is for a friend s wedding!'
p2383
aS'When you feel overwhelmed by the overwhelming number of details that need your attention, all of the guests who haven t RSVPed yet, your favorite flower having the gall to not be in season on the day of your wedding just remember, it s only one day. Most importantly, you make the most out of that day by enjoying it not by stressing out each minute over another new drama that has arisen. Be tough, prioritize, and keep everything in perspective. It s an important day, only because it s the start of your marriage and the rest of your life with the love of your life by your side!'
p2384
aS'Jenn knows that she is not very decisive, and that her opinion of how things look is sometimes too easily swayed by price. So, she took someone whose taste she trusted unequivocally her future husband! Jenn thought it was as much her dress as his, and honestly wanted his input. We went to several shops, in California and in DC, and found  the dress  the Augusta Jones Juno. Unfortunately, it was a bit over budget so Jenn (ever-resourceful) found a never-worn one online at a third of the price, and had it altered in DC.'
p2385
aS'Shoes are by Coloriffic, bought on Zappos (the only one of three pairs that Jenn could walk in). Hair accessories were two orchid blooms. Veil was bought on Etsy, by LoveJessicaCatherine. Jewelry was a simple pearl necklace, a gift from my uncle.'
p2386
aS'Towards the end of the reception, Jenn changed into her qipao the same one she wore ten years earlier, when she emceed the 2004 Irvine Chinese School New Years Festival with Michael!\n'

aS'I remember seeing our venue for the first time  Healdsburg Country Gardens. It s a private residence, so there s a wonderful air of mystery about the place. And it was obvious that its grape-covered patio, big old oak tree, bounty of vineyards, and wooden barn would make for a heck of a party.'
p2425
aS'Jeff is an art director, so once we chose our venue, we put our heads together to come up with a summery color palette. We wanted to be surrounded by cheery pops of color, so we chose coral bridesmaid dresses and bright flower arrangements with sprays of red, coral, and periwinkle.'
p2426
aS'We had quite a few dorky conversations about fonts, and ended up with Eames-inspired numbers and romantic lettering. All of the menus and signage were designed by Jeff, as well as the guest book, and we spent long nights painting, printing, and xacto-ing to get everything done in time for the big day.'
p2427
aS'In the end, it was the happiest day of our joint lives. To have all of your family and friends together in one place to celebrate your love is an absolutely soul-empowering experience. And with our one year anniversary coming up in September, we re especially in the mood for reminiscing.\n'

Get lost in all the lovely right here.'

aS'From Amy Kaneko Kelly and Alex   an attorney and neuroscientist who live in San Francisco   envisioned a rustic, woodsy wedding. They scoured venues all over the Bay area and settled on a forested B&B in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Their ceremony took place in a clearing in the woods. They stood under a chuppah made of birch branches, gauzy fabric, and trailing vines. Bright wildflowers were tucked in sap jars and planted along the aisle. Afterwards, guests sipped cocktails in the shade of a massive redwood tree, then enjoyed a farm-to-table dinner. After dinner, the groom s relatives performed classic dance hits in the stone ruins of an old barrel cellar.\n'
